<title>Richard Stallman: We Can Do Better Than Bitcoin</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://cryptosumer.com/2018/11/24/free-software-messiah-richard-stallman-we-can-do-better-than-bitcoin/</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;248.33131067961&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Stallman, the fervently committed founder of the free software movement, is discussing the term “libertarian,” when he stops talking abruptly and says, “Hello?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tell him I’m still listening, but he explains that the confused greeting wasn’t intended for me. Instead, he says a man’s voice – neither mine nor an echo of his – had just cut in with one word: “liberty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Does that sort of thing happen a lot?” I ask. I hadn’t heard anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes,” he says. “It wasn’t a voice I recognize.” He added, “It could be … ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then a quick burst of static made his next words inaudible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a strange incident, but apparently not a new experience for Stallman, whose emails urge any NSA or FBI agents reading to “follow Snowden’s example” and blow the whistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stallman seems to check all of the old school cypherpunk boxes: in addition to being an Edward Snowden admirer, he’s a hacker of the original ’70s and ’80s generation, a privacy activist, and a frequent invoker of liberty. As a result, cryptocurrency enthusiasts could be forgiven for thinking Stallman was also head-over-heels for bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before his oration on libertarianism was interrupted, he said that the right-wingers who made up a significant portion of bitcoin’s early adopters don’t really deserve the label. His own pro-freedom views are more “libertarian” than bitcoiners’ “anti-socialism,” he argued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we spoke, it became clear that Stallman doesn’t find the decade-old technology all that appealing, for more reasons than just politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have never used it myself,” he told CoinDesk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that’s surprising, keep in mind that fine distinctions matter a great deal to Stallman. For example, he wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot;&gt;9,000-word explainer&lt;/a&gt; on the difference between the terms GNU and Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 40-ish words: GNU, which Stallman proposed in 1983, is an operating system using exclusively free software. Linux, created years later by Linus Torvalds, is a kernel. Many refer to packages combining the two as “Linux,” but Stallman insists that the proper term is GNU/Linux or just GNU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot;&gt;3,000 words&lt;/a&gt; on the differences between free software and open source software. Advocates of both push for the freedom to use, study, change and redistribute software, but Stallman said that those similarities conceal “a deeply important moral disagreement” centered on freedom and human rights, which the free software movement stresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GNU Project, which Stallman founded, is working on an alternative digital payments system called Taler, which is based on cryptography but is not – forgive the hair-splitting – a cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Taler project’s maintainer Christian Grothoff told CoinDesk that the system is, rather, designed for a “post-blockchain” world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concerned with privacy…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t even seem like the technology has been around long enough to already be thinking of a world after it, but to Stallman, bitcoin isn’t suitable as a digital payment system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His biggest complaint: bitcoin’s poor privacy protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He told CoinDesk, “What I’d really like is a way to make purchases anonymously from various kinds of stores, and unfortunately it wouldn’t be feasible for me with bitcoin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a crypto exchange would allow that company and ultimately the government to identify him, he said. And as for mining the bitcoin himself, it’s a big investment and besides, he continued, “I’ve got other things I’d rather do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked what he thought about so-called privacy coins, Stallman said he’d gotten an expert to assess their potential, and “for each one he would point out some serious problems, perhaps in its security or its scalability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And speaking broadly, Stallman continued:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If bitcoin protected privacy, I’d probably have found a way to use it by now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;…But not ‘perfect’ privacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That pessimism aside, the GNU Project’s Taler does share some aspects with cryptocurrency projects – most notably it aims to fill the same niche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with Taler’s intellectual lineage. It’s based on blind signatures, a cryptographic technique invented by David Chaum, whose DigiCash was among the first attempts at creating secure electronic money. Plus, Taler’s attempt to create a digital money that resists surveillance by governments and payments companies aligns it with many cryptocurrency projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, Taler does not attempt to bypass centralized authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payments are processed by openly centralized “exchanges” rather than peer-to-peer networks of miners because, Grothoff said, such a system “would again enable dangerous, money laundering kind of practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, in a break with the anti-government ethos that has tended to characterize bitcoin and some of its peers, Taler’s design explicitly tries to block opportunities for tax evasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking to this, Stallman told CoinDesk, “We need a state to do many vital jobs, including fund research, fund education, provide people with medical care – provide everyone with medical care – build roads, maintain order, provide justice, including to those who are not rich and powerful, and so the state’s got to bring in a lot of money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a break from the political leanings of many of bitcoin’s first adherents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stallman continued:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;span&gt;I wouldn’t want perfect privacy because that would mean it would be impossible to investigate crimes at all. And that’s one of the jobs we need the state to do.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privacy in the Taler system, then, is limited to users spending their digital cash. They are shielded from surveillance because, Grothoff said, “the exchange, when coins are being redeemed, cannot tell if it was customer A or customer B or customer C who received the coin, because they all look identical from the exchange.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nobody,” he added, “exactly knows who has how many tokens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merchants (or anyone) receiving payments, on the other hand, do so visibly and in the open, making it possible for governments to assess taxes on their income – not to mention harder for the recipients to participate in money laundering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A place for crypto?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Taler is not a cryptocurrency and doesn’t have a native asset (there are no talers or TalerCoins), as a new payment rail for existing assets, the system could support cryptocurrency at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as euros (the first currency that will be supported by the system), dollars and yen could all be sent using Taler, so could bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, while Taler is not a blockchain, a blockchain-based system could take the place of a bank within the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For users to be able to move euros into the Taler wallet, though, Taler exchanges will need to interact with the traditional banking system to withdraw that money. In this same way, a blockchain-based system could work with Taler exchanges to allow users to get access to their cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grothoff compared the act of moving bank deposits to a Taler digital wallet to taking cash out of an ATM. Coins in the wallet are stored locally on a user’s device, and if a user loses the key to their wallet, there’s nothing that can be done to recover it, much like the crypto space’s use of private/public key pairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, Taler is in talks with European banks to allow withdrawal into the Taler wallet and also re-deposit from the Taler system back into the traditional banking system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the launch date on the project’s website &lt;a href=&quot;https://taler.net/en/faq.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot;&gt;still lists 2018&lt;/a&gt;, Grothoff said, it’s dependent of how quickly discussions with banks can be wrapped up. And he said, “The banks &lt;span&gt;are not necessarily easy or cheap to deal with.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although, nothing about the traditional banking system per se is essential to Taler’s functioning (except perhaps for regulatory compliance). In principle, the “register-based system” that Taler plugs into could be a bank account or, in theory, a blockchain, said Grothoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Taler gains traction, developers can experiment with different implementations and integrations – using banks or blockchains or whatever other register system they prefer. After all, Grothoff said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s free software.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<title>Dive – A tool for exploring each layer in a Docker image</title>
<link>https://github.com/wagoodman/dive</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/wagoodman/dive</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body p-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/wagoodman/dive&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e32588f298c69930fcf238834350e7c1b43b4b07/68747470733a2f2f676f7265706f7274636172642e636f6d2f62616467652f6769746875622e636f6d2f7761676f6f646d616e2f64697665&quot; alt=&quot;Go Report Card&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/wagoodman/dive&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A tool for exploring a docker image, layer contents, and discovering ways to shrink your Docker image size.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/wagoodman/dive/blob/master/.data/demo.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/wagoodman/dive/raw/master/.data/demo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To analyze a Docker image simply run dive with an image tag/id/digest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
dive &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;your-image-tag&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or if you want to build your image then jump straight into analyzing it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
dive build -t &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;some-tag&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is beta quality!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Feel free to submit an issue if you want a new feature or find a bug :)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Basic Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Show Docker image contents broken down by layer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you select a layer on the left, you are shown the contents of that layer combined with all previous layers on the right. Also, you can fully explore the file tree with the arrow keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indicate what's changed in each layer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Files that have changed, been modified, added, or removed are indicated in the file tree. This can be adjusted to show changes for a specific layer, or aggregated changes up to this layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Estimate &quot;image efficiency&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower left pane shows basic layer info and an experimental metric that will guess how much wasted space your image contains. This might be from duplicating files across layers, moving files across layers, or not fully removing files. Both a percentage &quot;score&quot; and total wasted file space is provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick build/analysis cycles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can build a Docker image and do an immediate analysis with one command: &lt;code&gt;dive build -t some-tag .&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You only need to replace your &lt;code&gt;docker build&lt;/code&gt; command with the same &lt;code&gt;dive build&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ubuntu/Debian&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
wget https://github.com/wagoodman/dive/releases/download/v0.3.0/dive_0.3.0_linux_amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./dive_0.3.0_linux_amd64.deb
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RHEL/Centos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
curl -OL https://github.com/wagoodman/dive/releases/download/v0.3.0/dive_0.3.0_linux_amd64.rpm
rpm -i dive_0.3.0_linux_amd64.rpm
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arch Linux&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Available as &lt;a href=&quot;https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dive/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;dive&lt;/a&gt; in the Arch User Repository (AUR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
aurman -S dive
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above example assumes &lt;code&gt;aurman&lt;/code&gt; as the tool for installing AUR packages. &lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt;: the AUR repository is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; controlled by the dive project maintainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mac&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
brew tap wagoodman/dive
brew install dive
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or download a Darwin build from the releases page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
go get github.com/wagoodman/dive
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Docker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
docker pull wagoodman/dive
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
docker pull quay.io/wagoodman/dive
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When running you'll need to include the docker client binary and socket file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
docker run --rm -it \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    wagoodman/dive:latest &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;dive arguments...&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Docker for Windows (showing PowerShell compatible line breaks; collapse to a single line for Command Prompt compatibility)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
docker run --rm -it &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock &lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    wagoodman/dive:latest &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;dive arguments...&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; depending on the version of docker you are running locally you may need to specify the docker API version as an environment variable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
   DOCKER_API_VERSION=1.37 dive ...
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or if you are running with a docker image:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
docker run --rm -it \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -e DOCKER_API_VERSION=1.37
    wagoodman/dive:latest &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;dive arguments...&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;KeyBindings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Key Binding&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl + C&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Exit&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;Tab&lt;/kbd&gt; or &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl + Space&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Switch between the layer and filetree views&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl + F&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Filter files&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl + A&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Layer view: see aggregated image modifications&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl + L&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Layer view: see current layer modifications&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;Space&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Filetree view: collapse/uncollapse a directory&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl + A&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Filetree view: show/hide added files&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl + R&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Filetree view: show/hide removed files&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl + M&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Filetree view: show/hide modified files&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl + U&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Filetree view: show/hide unmodified files&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;PageUp&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Filetree view: scroll up a page&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;PageDown&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Filetree view: scroll down a page&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Configuration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No configuration is necessary, however, you can create a config file and override values:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-yaml&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;:
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;enabled&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;./dive.log&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;level&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Note: you can specify multiple bindings by separating values with a comma.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Note: UI hinting is derived from the first binding&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;keybinding&lt;/span&gt;:
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Global bindings&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;quit&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;ctrl+c&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;toggle-view&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;tab, ctrl+space&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;filter-files&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;ctrl+f, ctrl+slash&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Layer view specific bindings  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;compare-all&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;ctrl+a&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;compare-layer&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;ctrl+l&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; File view specific bindings&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;toggle-collapse-dir&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;space&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;toggle-added-files&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;ctrl+a&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;toggle-removed-files&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;ctrl+r&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;toggle-modified-files&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;ctrl+m&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;toggle-unmodified-files&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;ctrl+u&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;page-up&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;pgup&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;page-down&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;pgdn&lt;/span&gt;
  
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;diff&lt;/span&gt;:
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; You can change the default files show in the filetree (right pane). All diff types are shown by default. &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;hide&lt;/span&gt;:
    - &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;added&lt;/span&gt;
    - &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;removed&lt;/span&gt;
    - &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;changed&lt;/span&gt;
    - &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;unchanged&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;filetree&lt;/span&gt;:
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; The default directory-collapse state&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;collapse-dir&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; The percentage of screen width the filetree should take on the screen (must be &amp;gt;0 and &amp;lt;1)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;pane-width&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;layer&lt;/span&gt;:
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Enable showing all changes from this layer and ever previous layer&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;show-aggregated-changes&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dive will search for configs in the following locations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/.dive.yaml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dive.yaml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/.config/dive.yaml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I found a typo in the District of Columbia’s legal code and corrected it using GitHub. My feat highlights the groundbreaking way the District manages its legal code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a member of the DC Mayor’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://ogag.dc.gov/&quot;&gt;Open Government Advisory Group&lt;/a&gt;, I was researching &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/sections/1-1162.05c.html&quot;&gt;the law that establishes DC’s office of open government,&lt;/a&gt; which issues regulations and advisory opinions for the District’s open meetings law (OMA) and open records law (FOIA). The law was updated last month, and something seemed to have changed: there was no longer a reference to issuing advisory opinions for FOIA. Comparing the DC Code to &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/laws/22-168.html&quot;&gt;the act that made the change&lt;/a&gt;, I noticed that something was amiss in section (d):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1_Zpu34x1OTy1urN60rbO0RA.png&quot; class=&quot;enlarge&quot; data-height=&quot;808&quot; data-width=&quot;1589&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1_Zpu34x1OTy1urN60rbO0RA-980x498.png&quot; width=&quot;980&quot; height=&quot;498&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(d) The Office of Open Government may issue advisory opinions on the implementation of subchapter I of Chapter 5 of Title 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had a typo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/titles/2/chapters/5/subchapters/I/&quot;&gt;Subchapter I of Chapter 5 of Title 2 of the DC Code&lt;/a&gt; is about how the DC government makes regulations. FOIA is subchapter II, not subchapter I. In other words, the link to “subchapter I of Chapter 5 of Title 2” took visitors to the wrong part of the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The District does something with its legal code that no other jurisdiction in the world does (to my knowledge): it publishes the law on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. GitHub is a website used primarily by software developers to share and collaborate on software code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers and engineers noticed in the early part of this decade that &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/2012/09/17/standardizing-the-worlds-legislative-information-one-hackathon-at-a-time/&quot;&gt;lawmaking and software engineering have a lot in common&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to tracking changes to their code—whether it be legal code or software code. The District has managed to take a practice of modern software development and apply it to its legal code by putting its legal code onto GitHub at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DCCouncil/dc-law-xml&quot;&gt;https://github.com/DCCouncil/dc-law-xml&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a copy of the DC law. It is an authoritative source. It is where the DC Council stores the digital versions of enacted laws, and this source feeds directly into the Council’s DC Code website at &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/&quot;&gt;https://code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I opened the file on GitHub that had the typo, edited the file, and submitted my edit using GitHub’s “pull request” feature. A pull request is a request to the file’s maintainer to review a change and then, if approved, pull it in to the main file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1_a6CGq_90Wdu4XvdC4ePn-g.png&quot; class=&quot;enlarge&quot; data-height=&quot;785&quot; data-width=&quot;1123&quot; alt=&quot;This is an XML file for a DC law. On GitHub, the pencil icon begins the process of creating an edit to a file. This is at &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://github.com/DCCouncil/dc-law-xml/blob/master/dc/council/periods/22/laws/22-168.xml&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://github.com/DCCouncil/dc-law-xml/blob/master/dc/council/periods/22/laws/22-168.xml&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1_a6CGq_90Wdu4XvdC4ePn-g-980x685.png&quot; width=&quot;980&quot; height=&quot;685&quot; alt=&quot;This is an XML file for a DC law.

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1_a6CGq_90Wdu4XvdC4ePn-g.png&quot; class=&quot;enlarge-link&quot; data-height=&quot;785&quot; data-width=&quot;1123&quot;&gt;Enlarge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sep&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; This is an XML file for a DC law. On GitHub, the pencil icon begins the process of creating an edit to a file.

&lt;p&gt;Here I’m editing the file and changing the roman numeral “I” to “II” in the XML markup of the citation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1_tB1GphvfHQTefllN3qmhNg.png&quot; class=&quot;enlarge&quot; data-height=&quot;799&quot; data-width=&quot;1123&quot; alt=&quot;I edited the XML file containing the typo (dc/council/periods/22/laws/22–168.xml) and submitted it with a comment for review.&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1_tB1GphvfHQTefllN3qmhNg-980x697.png&quot; width=&quot;980&quot; height=&quot;697&quot; alt=&quot;I edited the XML file containing the typo (dc/council/periods/22/laws/22–168.xml) and submitted it with a comment for review.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-credit&quot;&gt;Josh Tauberer&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later, the Council’s codification lawyer merged &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DCCouncil/dc-law-xml/pull/134&quot;&gt;my pull request&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1_Y2slHln06YJr3WCLZ4cWWQ.png&quot; class=&quot;enlarge&quot; data-height=&quot;318&quot; data-width=&quot;992&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1_Y2slHln06YJr3WCLZ4cWWQ-980x314.png&quot; width=&quot;980&quot; height=&quot;314&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-credit&quot;&gt;Josh Tauberer&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... and the DC Code website was automatically updated, showing what you’ll see on the page today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1_aFYb8wXB7hWFtfm_vMBBvw.png&quot; class=&quot;enlarge&quot; data-height=&quot;626&quot; data-width=&quot;1956&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1_aFYb8wXB7hWFtfm_vMBBvw-980x314.png&quot; width=&quot;980&quot; height=&quot;314&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-credit&quot;&gt;Josh Tauberer&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a milestone in the advancement of open government and open legal publishing. No one should expect that editing the law on GitHub is going to become the new normal, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My edit wasn’t substantive. This sort of “technical correction,” as lawyers would call it, didn’t need to be passed by the Council and signed by the Mayor. I also happen to have expertise in this particular law, GitHub, XML, and the Council’s new publishing process created by the Open Law Library. So I knew what change to submit, and DC’s codification counsel was able to merge it with the click of a button. That’s not how lawmaking works, and GitHub’s pull-request feature isn’t going to replace public hearings, expert testimony, negotiations between stakeholders, votes by elected representatives, etc. — and it shouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Open Law Library’s new legal publishing process is groundbreaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Open Law Library is changing how we change the law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Code of the District of Columbia (the “DC Code”) is the compilation of laws enacted by our local legislative body, the Council of the District of Columbia. Each time the Council passes an act, it amends existing law—add a section, strike a semicolon, and so on. Those piecemeal changes in the act are then incorporated, one by one, into the Code in a process called codification. During codification, lawyers not only strike those semicolons, but they also make thoughtful decisions about how to arrange new parts of the law so that everything makes some logical sense all together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Council’s codification process has been overhauled in recent years. What was once a largely manual process of dissecting Word documents containing the acts and placing parts into other Word documents containing the organized DC Code, this workflow is becoming more and more automated by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openlawlib.org/&quot;&gt;Open Law Library&lt;/a&gt;, the Council’s new nonprofit codification contractor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Law Library’s mission as a nonprofit is to make all laws as open and accessible as possible. The library’s strategy is to achieve openness by making openness pay off for governments: it uses open, machine-readable laws to build software tools that make codification faster and more accurate. The cool thing about this is that governments can benefit from using Open Law Library’s software even if open data isn’t their highest priority, but in the background they’ll still be publishing their laws in an open and accessible format—everybody wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, instead of authoring the DC Code in Word documents stored on a hard drive in a locked room in a basement, the Code is now stored in XML format in a place everyone can see—on the Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you looked closely, you may have noticed that the screenshots above aren’t all showing the same document. The Open Law Library’s new technology transforms the XML file that stores DC Law 22–168 (the file I edited) into the website for DC Code § 1–1162.05c. The software changes the text of the citation from “the Freedom of Information Act” into “subchapter I of Chapter 5 of Title 2” and adds an HTML link based on the XML tag around the citation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It’s full circle for me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m thrilled that the District has come so far in innovating legal publishing—partly because I helped put this all in motion. This transition began in 2013 when local civic hacker Tom MacWright, epic legal data liberator Carl Malamud, the Council’s own lawyer Dave Zvenyach, and I put the first full download of the District’s legal code online. Malamud bought a printed copy of the DC Code, digitized it, and mailed it around on USB thumb drives. After &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/09/dc-code-hackathon_n_3039271.html&quot;&gt;two hackathons&lt;/a&gt; and some funding from the Council, by 2014 we had converted the DC Code into XML and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DCCouncil/dc-code-prototype&quot;&gt;posted in unofficially on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; for anyone to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/0_188Vc8YZhbgxquUp.png&quot; width=&quot;375&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;In 2012, Carl Malamud distributed physical and electronic copies of the DC Code. This shipment went to Waldo Jaquith. The George Washington-shaped USB thumb drive contained the digitized version from Malamud’s scans of the physical edition.&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;In 2012, Carl Malamud distributed physical and electronic copies of the DC Code. This shipment went to Waldo Jaquith. The George Washington-shaped USB thumb drive contained the digitized version from Malamud’s scans of the physical edition.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-credit&quot;&gt;Waldo Jaquith&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://opengovdata.io/2014/state-laws-the-district-columbia-code/&quot;&gt;I wrote more about our efforts back in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, but putting the law online is an ongoing issue. Eighteen states and the District have now enacted &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uniformlaws.org/Act.aspx?title=Electronic%20Legal%20Material%20Act&quot;&gt;Uniform Electronic Legal Material Acts (UELMA)&lt;/a&gt;, which is driving adoption of modern legal publishing practices by the states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some states are resisting. Earlier this year, Malamud &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/appeal_georgia_annotated_code_copyright&quot;&gt;won a case against the state of Georgia&lt;/a&gt; which tried to prevent him from sharing electronic copies of the state’s legal code! And in DC, while the Council is making progress with the DC Code, other parts of DC law, including regulations, now lag behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the District, several other jurisdictions are publishing their legal codes with official bulk XML downloads: the US federal government began publishing XML downloads for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.govinfo.gov/help/cfr&quot;&gt;Code of Federal Regulations&lt;/a&gt; in 2009 and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://uscode.house.gov/download/download.shtml&quot;&gt;United States Code&lt;/a&gt; in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also dozens of private/nonprofit sector projects to create open legal data where it doesn’t exist officially elsewhere, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.courtlistener.com/api/&quot;&gt;CourtListener&lt;/a&gt; for the US courts, and my organization &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.govtrack.us/&quot;&gt;GovTrack.us&lt;/a&gt; did the same for bills before Congress until &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/civic-tech-thoughts-from-joshdata/govtrack-now-actually-uses-open-government-data-5fc16f377e86&quot;&gt;Congress itself began publishing open legislative data&lt;/a&gt;. And there have been many unofficial attempts to put legal codes on collaboration websites like GitHub (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2012/08/bundestag/&quot;&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.itworld.com/article/2904079/france-s-laws-are-now-on-github.html&quot;&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;), and related efforts by Waldo Jaquith and the OpenGov Foundation on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statedecoded.com/places/&quot;&gt;State Decoded&lt;/a&gt; project in three states and three cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the District appears to be the first jurisdiction to combine the two by putting its legal code on GitHub and accepting a change from a member of the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why it matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishing legal codes on GitHub is a real government innovation. It isn’t like the techno-solutionist blockchain nonsense that is in vogue lately. It’s the cherry on top of real work happening inside the DC government improving a process hundreds of years old:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Council is able to publish the law better and faster than ever before. With the District’s previous codification contractor, updates to the DC Code were published three times a year, and there could be a five-to-seven month delay in seeing the latest laws. But the Open Law Library has shortened the publication process to about a week after a law is enacted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It also means we’re all getting to see more of the actual law that governs us—not the law as it was months ago.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The laws are now published on an easy-to-use, modern, searchable, mobile-friendly, and free website: &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/&quot;&gt;https://code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This increases access to justice for District residents and lawyers at legal aid organizations who don’t have access to high-priced legal research tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope other jurisdictions learn from the District and move the law forward with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openlawlib.org/&quot;&gt;Open Law Library,&lt;/a&gt; and I especially hope that the District expands its use of Open Law Library tools to other aspects of DC law starting with the DC Municipal Regulations (DCMR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://razor.occams.info/&quot;&gt;Joshua Tauberer&lt;/a&gt; is a civic hacker based in the District of Columbia best known for founding &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.govtrack.us/&quot;&gt;GovTrack.us&lt;/a&gt;, which created the first comprehensive open data for legislation in the US Congress. He previously was a consultant for the DC Council, where he created the first data standards for the Council’s ongoing work to modernize the DC Code, and the US House of Representatives’s Office of the Law Revision Counsel, which publishes the United States Code. He is currently a contractor for &lt;a href=&quot;https://govready.com/&quot;&gt;GovReady PBC&lt;/a&gt; and a member of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ogag.dc.gov/&quot;&gt;DC Mayor’s Open Government Advisory Group.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>German federal office publishes Windows 10 telemetry analysis</title>
<link>https://www.ghacks.net/2018/11/23/german-federal-office-bsi-publishes-telemetry-analysis/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.ghacks.net/2018/11/23/german-federal-office-bsi-publishes-telemetry-analysis/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The German Federal Office for Information Security, BSI (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik) published a detailed Windows 10 Telemetry analysis on November 20, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research paper, which is available in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Cyber-Sicherheit/SiSyPHus/Workpackage4_Telemetry.pdf&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; (partially) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Cyber-Sicherheit/Empfehlungen/SiSyPHuS_Win10/AP4/SiSyPHuS_AP4.html&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;German&lt;/a&gt;, provides a deep analysis of Telemetry functionality that Microsoft implemented in the company's Windows 10 operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-148895&quot; src=&quot;https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/telemetry.png&quot; alt=&quot;telemetry&quot; width=&quot;1198&quot; height=&quot;657&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper is based on Windows 10 version 1607 Enterprise. It covers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An overview of Windows 10's event tracing functionality for Telemetry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A technical analysis on how Telemetry data is collected and processed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An analysis of the network interfaces and connections used to transfer Telemetry data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A look at configuration and logging capabilities to monitor and control Telemetry data collecting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report is quite technical in nature and the first couple of pages are only available in German at the time of writing. You may want to skip ahead to page 9, Executive Summary, if you don't understand German; the English part of the report begins with chapter 1.2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: An extra, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Cyber-Sicherheit/SiSyPHus/Analyse_Telemetriekomponente.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;amp;v=4&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;German-only&lt;/a&gt;, paper is available that includes system-based and network-based options to limit or block the collection or transfer of Telemetry data to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You find interesting tidbits in the report even if you are not interested in technicalities like the number of Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) providers associated with Autologger-Diagtrack-Listener and Diagtrack Listener for each of the supported Telemetry levels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Security -- 9 and 4 ETW Providers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic -- 93 and 410 ETW Providers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhanced -- 105 and 418 ETW Providers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full -- 112 and 422 ETW Providers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Security telemetry level is reserved to Enterprise editions of Windows 10. Home users may choose between Basic and Full, and the difference in providers is not as large as one would think based on the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of ETW Providers stands in no direct correlation to the amount of data that is collected or its quality according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report list hostnames and IP addresses that Windows 10's Telemetry service uses for communication based on a connection log of 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup width=&quot;331&quot;/&gt;&lt;colgroup width=&quot;105&quot;/&gt;&lt;colgroup width=&quot;155&quot;/&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot; height=&quot;17&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hostname&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reports provide detailed Telemetry information that is useful to interested Windows users but especially to administrators who want to know more about how Telemetry works on Windows 10 devices.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Cities across China have debuted crime-fighting facial recognition technology to much fanfare over the past year. But some of these jaywalker-busting devices aren’t as impressive as they seem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A facial recognition system in the city of Ningbo caught &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caixinglobal.com/2016-12-08/101024257.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dong Mingzhu,&lt;/a&gt; the chair of appliance-making giant Gree Electric, running a red light. Only it turned out not to be Dong, but rather an advertisement featuring her face on the side of a bus, local police said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weibo.com/1968066827/H3I8xdnqY?from=page_1001061968066827_profile&amp;amp;wvr=6&amp;amp;mod=weibotime&amp;amp;type=comment#_rnd1542869245007&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;on Weibo&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police said they have upgraded their tech to avoid issues like this in the future. The real Dong, meanwhile, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caixinglobal.com/2018-11-14/chairman-and-president-sued-amid-drama-at-ev-company-101346997.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;embroiled in drama&lt;/a&gt; with an electric vehicle company. &lt;/p&gt;

<title>Everyone is totally just winging it, all the time (2014)</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/news/oliver-burkeman-s-blog/2014/may/21/everyone-is-totally-just-winging-it</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/news/oliver-burkeman-s-blog/2014/may/21/everyone-is-totally-just-winging-it</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Amid the acrimony surrounding &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/media/jill-abramson&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;the firing of Jill Abramson&lt;/a&gt;, executive editor of the New York Times, there's one point of near-universal consensus: the whole thing was remarkably poorly handled. (Even the Times's publisher, Arthur Sulzberger, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2014/05/arthur-sulzberger-interview-jill-abramson-firing&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;seems to agree about that&lt;/a&gt;.) Whatever your views of the people involved, it seemed hard to believe: how could an institution as august and smoothly competent as the Times have stumbled so badly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were echoes of that same incredulity in Britain this week when Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, revealed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ed-miliband/10844063/Ed-Miliband-in-car-crash-local-radio-interview.html&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;in a car-crash of a regional radio interview&lt;/a&gt; that he didn't know who he was campaigning for there. Whether you love him, hate him, or hadn't heard of him before reading this blog post, you'd be forgiven for shaking your head. Surely the head of &lt;a href=&quot;http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/uk-polling-report-average-2&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;the most popular party&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;world's sixth-largest economy&lt;/a&gt; has someone to brief him on such basics?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're similarly shocked whenever authority figures who are supposed to know what they're doing make it plain that they don't, President Obama's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/21/obama-healthcare-website-problems-live&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;healthcare launch&lt;/a&gt; being probably the most serious recent example. We shouldn't really be shocked, though. Because all these stories illustrate one of the most fundamental yet still under-appreciated truths of human existence, which is this: everyone is totally just winging it, all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutions – from national newspapers to governments and politicial parties – invest an enormous amount of money and effort in denying this truth. The facades they maintain are crucial to their authority, and thus to their legitimacy and continued survival. We need them to appear ultra-competent, too, because we derive much psychological security from the belief that somewhere, in the highest echelons of society, there are some near-infallible adults in charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, though, everyone is totally just winging it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For further evidence, consult &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/25z7dq/grownups_of_reddit_what_is_the_most_embarrassing/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;this popular Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt;, posted on Monday (I found it via &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/scienceofus/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Science of Us&lt;/a&gt;): &quot;Grown-Ups of Reddit, What is the most embarrassing thing that you should be able to do, but can’t?&quot; The short version is that nobody has much of a clue what they're doing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quoted&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quoted__contents&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic arithmetic. Really embarrassing at work when I panic and struggle to add up two small numbers :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm nearly 30 years old and don't know how to tie my shoes in the normal fashion. Instead I can only do it bunny ears-style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swim, ride a bike, drive a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am really bad at telling time on an analog clock, I know how it works and I can get there but I can't just glance at the clock and know the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've often thought of my experience of adulthood thus far as one of incrementally discovering that there's no institution, or walk of life, in which everybody isn't just winging it. Growing up, I assumed that the newspaper on the breakfast table must be assembled by people who truly knew what they were doing; then I got a job at a newspaper. Unconsciously, I transferred my assumptions of competence to (among others) people who worked in government. Then I got to know a few people who did – and who'd admit, after a pint or two, that their jobs involved staggering from crisis to crisis, concocting credible-sounding policies in cars en route to press conferences, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1T7QjbLye4&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;exactly as portrayed in The Thick of It&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; I found myself assuming, self-hatingly, that this might be explained by a certain bumbling Britishness, the perverse pride we sometimes take in shambling mediocrity. Then I started working in America. Where, it turns out, everyone is totally just winging it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This realisation is alarming at first, but it's ultimately deeply reassuring. As the UK organisation Action for Happiness &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.actionforhappiness.org/poster-9-acceptance&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;likes to point out&lt;/a&gt;, one of the biggest causes of misery is the way we chronically &quot;compare our insides with other people's outsides&quot;. We're all mini-New York Timeses or White Houses, energetically projecting an image of calm proficiency, while inside we're improvising in a mad panic. Yet we forget (especially in &lt;a href=&quot;http://wanderingstan.com/2010-07-22/facebook-acquaintances-the-new-tv-stars&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;an era of carefully curated Facebook profiles&lt;/a&gt; and suchlike) that everyone else is doing the same thing. The only difference is that they think it's &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; who's truly competent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a while trying to think of an ingenious conclusion to this post, so as to give the appearance that I'd been confidently advancing toward it from the start. But on this occasion, more than any other, it would seem appropriate to admit that I failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In closing, everyone is totally just winging it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Scammers are changing the contact details for banks on Google Maps</title>
<link>http://blog.abhijittomar.com/2018/10/19/google-business-claim-scam/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.abhijittomar.com/2018/10/19/google-business-claim-scam/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, a cousin of mine called me. He had just had INR 9000 (~$125) wiped from his account to a telephone banking scam. So how did this educated and tech savvy guy in his 20s, well aware of such scams end up in this situation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had fallen prey to an innovative type of scam that is plaguing multiple businesses listed on Google. Often when you search for a business on Google, you will see a card for it. It contains details like address, timings, and a phone number with the option to call them directly from the browser/app itself. This is similar to what my cousin saw when he searched for his local bank branch on Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.abhijittomar.com/assets/images/bank-scam/pnb.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;pnb&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business card of the bank visible on Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay close attention to the phone number listed on the screen. (Do not call it! It belongs to a scammer.) Upon calling that number for help regarding a failed online transaction, my cousin was greeted by a person pretending to be a bank employee. After a short conversation where my cousin explained his issue, he was asked for his card number and CVV. Trusting the scammer, he ended up giving the details and subsequently lost the entire sum in his account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I do understand that most would blame the person giving out his card details for being foolish enough to do so. I concur. However, in this the victim is not as much to blame for trusting the scammer as he is for trusting Google to provide him accurate information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we grow ever more reliant on technology, there is a subtext of trust that underlies every interaction we make via any app or website. When you see any information listed on a website, your first reaction isn’t to immediately question whether or not that information is accurate. It is to blindly trust the technology that has helped you unfailingly countless times in the past. That is precisely why this scam is so potent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On further investigation we realised that the same scammer had his phone number registered for multiple bank branches in the same region. This is partly because of how easy it is to claim a business on Google. I did not want to do anything illegal or harmful for the sake of an article so I did not try it out myself. But as explained in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdCZMWkYDJQ&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;, it is fairly easy and there seems to be little to no verification. I am sure Google has resolved such conflicts in the past where an original business owner had his/her business falsely claimed by someone else. However &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz7tiZgCgw8&quot;&gt;their method&lt;/a&gt; seems to be to appeal to the current owner to add you as an admin / transfer ownership. In case that doesn’t work, you appeal directly to Google to transfer ownership to you. It does seem to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.en.advertisercommunity.com/t5/Verification/Someone-else-verified-my-page/td-p/478594&quot;&gt;a mess&lt;/a&gt; but I hope it works in most cases. Again, there is a lot of trust even from Google’s side that people won’t claim businesses they don’t own. There does not seem to be channel to report fraudsters such as these - you can only request ownership transfer if you own the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can be said of an Indian public sector bank though? Technically they cannot be held liable for any incorrect information that does not appear on their own website. I doubt they’d care enough to go through Google’s appeal process. My fears were further confirmed when I decided to look up my local SBI branch on Google. &lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.abhijittomar.com/assets/images/bank-scam/sbi.png&quot; alt=&quot;sbi&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business card of my local bank on Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are multiple reviews claiming the listed number is fake. As of now, both fake numbers are still listed. A lot of information you see on Google is user contributed and often not vetted by any human. So do think twice next time you trust any information listed on Google. And if it’s a bank phone number, definitely don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know of any other such deceptive scam methods? &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:abhijit@abhijittomar.com&quot;&gt;Tell me about it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDIT (26/11/2018) : Since the time of publishing of this post, reports of this scam have been published by multiple news outlets-&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Researchers Created Fake &amp;#039;Master&amp;#039; Fingerprints to Unlock Smartphones</title>
<link>https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/bjenyd/researchers-created-fake-master-fingerprints-to-unlock-smartphones</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/bjenyd/researchers-created-fake-master-fingerprints-to-unlock-smartphones</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;AI can generate fake fingerprints that work as master keys for smartphones that use biometric sensors. According to the researchers that developed the technique, the attack can be launched against individuals with “some probability of success.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biometric IDs seem to be about as close to a perfect identification system as you can get. These types of IDs are based on the unique physical traits of individuals, such as fingerprints, irises, or even the &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wnjzen/future-digital-security-is-in-our-veins&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;veins in your hand&lt;/a&gt;. In recent years, however, security researchers have demonstrated that it is possible to fool &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qkjxpb/it-wont-be-difficult-to-spoof-smartphone-finger-vein-scanners&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt;, if not &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ypwvdy/fake-body-parts-still-fool-biometric-scanners&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;most&lt;/a&gt;, forms of biometric identification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most cases, spoofing biometric IDs requires making a &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qv3n77/iphone-x-face-id-mask-spoof&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fake face&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qkjxpb/it-wont-be-difficult-to-spoof-smartphone-finger-vein-scanners&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;finger vein pattern&lt;/a&gt; that matches an existing individual. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07386&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; posted to arXiv earlier this month, however, researchers from New York University and the University of Michigan detailed how they trained a machine learning algorithm to generate fake fingerprints that can serve as a match for a “large number” of real fingerprints stored in databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known as DeepMasterPrints, these artificially generated fingerprints are similar to the master key for a building. To create a master fingerprint the researchers fed an artificial neural network—a type of computing architecture loosely modeled on the human brain that “learns” based on input data—the real fingerprints from over 6,000 individuals. Although the researchers were not the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7893784&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;first to consider creating master fingerprints&lt;/a&gt;, they were the first to use a machine learning algorithm to create working master prints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A “generator” neural net then analyzed these fingerprint images so it could begin producing its own. These synthetic fingerprints were then fed to a “discriminator” neural net that determined if they were genuine or fake. If they were determined to be fake, the generator then made a small adjustment to the image and tried again. This process was repeated thousands of times until the generator was able to successfully fool the discriminator—a setup known as a generative adversarial network, or GAN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The master prints generated by the researchers were specifically designed to target the type of fingerprint sensors found in most modern smartphones. These capacitive fingerprints scanners usually only take partial readings of fingerprints when they are placed on the sensor. This is mostly for convenience since it would be impractical to require a user to place their finger on the sensor the exact same way each time they scan their print. The convenience of partial fingerprint readings comes at the cost of security, which is convenient for a sneaky AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers used two types of fingerprint data for training their neural nets. One data set used “rolled” fingerprints that consist of images scanned from prints that were inked on paper. The other data set was generated from capacitive sensors that are used to digitally capture a fingerprint. Overall, the system was significantly better at spoofing capacitive fingerprints than at spoofing rolled prints at each of three security levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__blockquote&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read More:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/43q4jp/aadhaar-hack-insecure-biometric-id-system&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The World’s Largest Biometric ID System Keeps Getting Hacked&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each security level is defined by its false match rate (FMR), or the probability that the sensor will incorrectly identify a fingerprint as a match. The highest level of security only incorrectly identifies a match 0.01 percent of the time, the middle tier has an FMR of 0.1 percent, and the lowest level of security has an FMR of one percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the lowest of the three security tiers, the researchers were able to fool the sensor with their master fingerprints up to 76 percent of the time for digital prints. While this is impressive, the researchers also note that it is “unlikely” that any fingerprint sensor operates at such a low level of security. In the middle security tier, where a sensor incorrectly identifies a match 0.1 percent of the time—which the researchers described as a “realistic security option”—they were able to spoof digital fingerprints 22 percent of the time. As the researchers noted, this is a “much higher number of (impostor) matches than what the FMR would lead one to expect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the highest level of security, the researchers note that the master print is “not very good” at spoofing the sensor—the master prints only fooled the sensor less than 1.2 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this research doesn’t spell the end of fingerprint ID systems, the researchers said it will require the designers of these systems to rethink the tradeoff between convenience and security in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Water Computer&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-DTj0ZKapjGs/Tx4lA5vgnHI/AAAAAAAAE_8/yGFvi3rLE2A/s800/120123_water_1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;label&gt;(Vladimir Lukyanov's &lt;em&gt;water computer&lt;/em&gt;, 1936. Image courtesy of the Polytechnic Museum, Moscow.)&lt;/label&gt;&lt;p&gt;I only &lt;a href=&quot;http://pruned.blogspot.com/2012/01/spill.html&quot;&gt;recently&lt;/a&gt; found out about Google's &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.google.com/images/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;amp;p=searchbyimagepage&amp;amp;answer=1325808&quot;&gt;reverse image search&lt;/a&gt; functionality. Since then I've been busy feeding its search engine some of the more mysterious images that have been littering my archives for years, hoping finally to figure out what they are actually pictures of, and why I even found them interesting enough to keep in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those images is the one you see above. According to a translation of this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nkj.ru/archive/articles/7033/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; published in the Russian magazine &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nkj.ru/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science and Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2000, it shows one of the “monuments of science and technology” that “brought [the Soviet Union] to the forefront of the analog computer” — Vladimir Lukyanov's marvelous &lt;em&gt;water computer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built in 1936, this machine was “the world's first computer for solving [partial] differential equations,” which “for half a century has been the only means of calculations of a wide range of problems in mathematical physics.” Absolutely its most amazing aspect is that solving such complex equations meant playing around with a series of interconnected, water-filled glass tubes. You “calculated” with plumbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better explain how it works, here is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/02/guest-column-like-water-for-money/&quot;&gt;description&lt;/a&gt; by Steven Strogatz of what I'm assuming is a comparable device. Built in 1949, nearly a decade and a half after Lukyonov's, it's called the Phillips machine, after its inventor, Bill Phillips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the front right corner, in a structure that resembles a large cupboard with a transparent front, stands a Rube Goldberg collection of tubes, tanks, valves, pumps and sluices. You could think of it as a hydraulic computer. Water flows through a series of clear pipes, mimicking the way that money flows through the economy. It lets you see (literally) what would happen if you lower tax rates or increase the money supply or whatever; just open a valve here or pull a lever there and the machine sloshes away, showing in real time how the water levels rise and fall in various tanks representing the growth in personal savings, tax revenue, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a network of dynamic feedback loops,” Strogatz further writes. “In this sense the Phillips machine foreshadowed one of the most central challenges in science today: the quest to decipher and control the complex, interconnected systems that pervade our lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Moniac&quot; height=&quot;700&quot; src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Q5sTu50VE08/Tx4lCQSxD-I/AAAAAAAAFAE/dtnj7ldZLWA/s800/120123_water_2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;label&gt;(A diagram of the Philips machine, alternatively named the “Moniac” by a Chicago economist “to suggest money, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC&quot;&gt;ENIAC&lt;/a&gt;, and something maniacal.” &lt;a href=&quot;http://digg.com/newsbar/topnews/Hydraulic_Computer_from_the_1950s&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To go back to Lukyanov, his water computer was built specifically to solve the problem of cracking in concrete, a “scourge” that slowed the construction of railroads by his employer. Doing so meant developing manufacturing regimes for concrete blocks that took into account the complex relationships between material properties, the curing process and environmental conditions. Existing “calculation methods were not able to give fast and accurate solutions.” Lukyanov's invention did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appropriating and altering Strogatz's text, we get:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filling up not just a corner but the entire room, inside not one but several structures that resemble large cupboards with a transparent front, is a Rube Goldberg collection of tubes, tanks, valves, pumps and sluices. You could think of it as a hydraulic computer. Water flows through a series of clear pipes, mimicking the production line of concrete blocks. It lets you see (literally) what would happen if you change the type of cement used or increase the load capacity of the concrete or whatever; just open a valve here or pull a lever there and the machine sloshes away, showing in real time how the water levels rise and fall in various tanks representing material properties, curing time, temperature, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes to the water level in the “measuring tube” would be marked on a graph paper (“a kind of curve”), and “these marks build schedule, which was the solution of the problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the simplicity of their design and programming, subsequent models were “successfully used” in other fields such as geology, thermal physics, metallurgy and rocket engineering. The first and second generations of digital electronic computers could not match their computing abilities. In the mid-1970s, they were still being used in “115 manufacturing, research and educational institutions located in 40 cities” across the Soviet Union. “Only in the early 80s” were digital computers cheap, configurable and powerful enough to match the “possibility of [the] hydraulic integrator.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Polytechnic Museum Moscow&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-k-C01wuUd4c/Tx4lDwDsSuI/AAAAAAAAFAM/g1YPEG8NOSc/s800/120123_water_3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;label&gt;(A museum display at the Polytechnic Museum, Moscow, presenting an incomplete history of computers.

As an alternative, or at least to offer another layer of meaning, this augmented timeline presents a crypto-historical narrative of gardens as gigantic water computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Tivoli&quot; height=&quot;740&quot; src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-98zemyC0hKY/Tx4lFvPw8fI/AAAAAAAAFAU/jx0Si6OrrhU/s0/120123_water_4.jpg&quot; width=&quot;900&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;label&gt;(Etienne Dupérac's bird's-eye plan view of the gardens at Villa d'Este, Tivoli. &lt;a href=&quot;http://catena.bgc.bard.edu/este/index.htm&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All those water-screws, force pumps, water-lifting wheels, vents, wells and settling tanks, all those reservoirs, canals, aqueducts and pipes buried under mountains and rivers, and all those jets spurting out of vases and statuaries, creating water rainbows and sonic merriment, and all those fountains, water parterres, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pruned.blogspot.com/2008/04/giochi-daqua.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;giochi d'acqua&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, automatas and damp grottos: those are the gurgling circuits, the programmable interfaces, the data storage devices and the visualization screens of landscape proto-supercomputers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To operate it, you will have to consult an unpublished edition of Solomon de Caus's &lt;a href=&quot;http://cnum.cnam.fr/ILL/FDA1.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Les raisons des forces mouvantes, avec diverses machines tant utiles que plaisantes, auxquelles sont adjoints plusieurs dessings de grotes &amp;amp; fontaines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, from which the following may have been excerpted:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embedded in the earth is a Rube Goldberg collection of tubes, tanks, valves, pumps and sluices. You could think of it as a hydraulic computer. Water flows through a series of clear pipes, mimicking the way that money flows through the empire. It lets you see (literally) what would happen if you lower the price of bread or increase the construction of palaces or whatever; just open a valve here or pull a lever there and the machine in the garden sloshes away, showing in real time how the water levels rise and fall in various tanks representing colonial trade supplies, food riots, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attached to the measuring tube is a series of fountains that gurgles the solution to the equation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Jean-Baptiste Martin&quot; height=&quot;680&quot; src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ujyIbJ6Y4qE/Tx4lHHogBHI/AAAAAAAAFAc/jam4LlFencA/s800/120123_water_5.jpg&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;label&gt;(Jean-Baptiste Martin, &lt;em&gt;Vue du château de Versailles depuis le Bassin du Dragon et de Neptune&lt;/em&gt;, 1700. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marlymachine.org/mfountain2.htm&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gardeners and their patrons would then walk around marking the fluctuating levels of these fountains on graphic paper. From fountain to fountain, they follow a set of programmed perambulations, gathering data at relevant nodal points, along the way not just picking up the solutions to the problem being computed but also gaining a greater understanding of the complexities of the natural and social worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these gardens as crypto-water-computers, they were taking measurements of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;label&gt;(See also &lt;a href=&quot;http://pruned.blogspot.com/2005/08/la-machine-de-marly_24.html&quot;&gt;La Machine de Marly&lt;/a&gt;.

<title>LinkedIn violated data protection by using 18M email addresses of non-members</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/24/linkedin-ireland-data-protection/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/24/linkedin-ireland-data-protection/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;LinkedIn, the social network for the working world with close to 600 million users, has been called out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/the-11-creepiest-things-about-linkedin&quot;&gt;number&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/is-linkedin-the-creepiest-social-network-498946693&quot;&gt;times&lt;/a&gt; for how it is able to suggest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-linkedins-people-we-may-know-feature-is-so-accurate/&quot;&gt;uncanny&lt;/a&gt; connections to you, when it’s not even clear how or why LinkedIn would know enough to make those suggestions in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a run-in with a regulator in Europe illuminates how some of LinkedIn’s practices leading up to GDPR implementation in Europe were not only uncanny, but actually violated data protection rules, in LinkedIn’s case concerning some 18 million email addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details were revealed in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dataprotection.ie/docimages/documents/DPC%20Final%20Report%202018EN(1).pdf&quot;&gt;report published Friday&lt;/a&gt; by Ireland’s Data Protection Commissioner covering activities in the first six months of this calendar year. In a list of investigations that have been reported concerning Facebook, WhatsApp and the Yahoo data breach, the DPC revealed one investigation that had not been reported before. The DPC had conducted — and concluded — an investigation of Microsoft-owned LinkedIn, originally prompted by a complaint from a user in 2017, over LinkedIn’s practices regarding people who were not members of the social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short: in a bid to get more people to sign up to the service, LinkedIn admitted that it was using people’s email addresses — some 18 million in all — in a way that was not transparent. LinkedIn has since ceased the practice as a result of the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two parts to the supervision, as the DPC describes it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the DPC found that LinkedIn in the US had obtained emails for 18 million people who were not already members of the social network, and then used these in a hashed form for targeted advertisements on the Facebook platform, “with the absence of instruction from the data controller” — that is, LinkedIn Ireland — “as is required.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some backstory on this: LinkedIn, Facebook and others in the lead-up to GDPR coming into effect &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/19/facebook-moves-to-shrink-its-legal-liabilities-under-gdpr/&quot;&gt;moved data processing that had been going through Ireland to the US&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claim was that this was to “streamline” operations but critics have said that the moves could help to shield companies a bit more from any GDPR liability over how they use process data for non-EU users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The complaint was ultimately amicably resolved,” the DPC said, “with LinkedIn implementing a number of immediate actions to cease the processing of user data for the purposes that gave rise to the complaint.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the DPC then decided to conduct a further audit after it became “concerned with the wider systemic issues identified” in the initial investigation. There, it found that LinkedIn was also applying its social graph-building algorithms to build networks — to suggest professional networks for users, or “undertaking pre-computation,” as the DPC describes it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea here was build up suggested networks of compatible professional connections to help users overcome the hurdle of having to build networks from scratch — that being one of the hurdles in social networks for some people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a result of the findings of our audit, LinkedIn Corp was instructed by LinkedIn Ireland, as data controller of EU user data, to cease pre-compute processing and to delete all personal data associated with such processing prior to 25 May 2018,” the DPC writes. May 25 was the date that GDPR came into force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn has provided us with the following statement in relation to the whole investigation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We appreciate the DPC’s 2017 investigation of a complaint about an advertising campaign and fully cooperated,” said Denis Kelleher, Head of Privacy, EMEA, for LinkedIn. “Unfortunately the strong processes and procedures we have in place were not followed and for that we are sorry. We’ve taken appropriate action, and have improved the way we work to ensure that this will not happen again. During the audit, we also identified one further area where we could improve data privacy for non-members and we have voluntarily changed our practices as a result.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The ‘further area’ is the pre-computation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some takeaways from the incident:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking LinkedIn’s words at face value, it would seem that the company is trying to show that it is acting in good faith by going one step further than simply modifying what has been identified by the DPC, changing practices voluntarily before it gets called out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again, LinkedIn would not be the first company to “ask for forgiveness, not permission,” when it comes to pushing the boundaries of what is considered permissible behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are wondering why LinkedIn did not get fined in this process — which could be one lever for pushing a company to act right from the start, rather than only change practices after getting called out — that’s because until the implementation of GDPR at the end of May, the regulator &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DPCIreland/status/1066068400236048385&quot;&gt;had no power to enforce fines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we also don’t really know here — the DPC doesn’t really address it — is where LinkedIn obtained those 18 million email addresses, and any other related data, in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other cases reviewed in the report, such as the inquiry into Facial Recognition usage by Facebook, and how WhatsApp and Facebook share user data between each other, are still ongoing. Others, such as the investigation Yahoo security breach that affected 500 million users, are now trickling down into the companies modifying their practices.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>HolyJit: A New Hope</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: We believe there is a safer and easier way of writing a Jit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, all browsers’ Jits share a similar design. This design makes extending the language or improving its performance time-consuming and complex, especially while avoiding security issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, at the time of this writing, our Jit relies upon ~15000 lines of carefully crafted, hand-written assembly code (~36000 in Chromium’s v8). The Jit directory represents 5% of all the C++ code of Firefox, and contains 3 of the top 20 largest files of Firefox, all written by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, these files all contain code that is derived by hand from the Interpreter and a limited set of built-in functions of the JavaScript engine. But why do it by hand, when we could automatize the process, saving time and risk? HolyJit is exploring this possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, during the JS Team meetup, we have demonstrated the first prototype of a Rust meta-Jit compiler, named HolyJit. If our experiment proves successful, we believe that employing a strategy based on HolyJit will let us avoid many potential bugs and let us concentrate on strategic issues. This means more time to implement JavaScript features quickly and further improve the speed of our Jit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;http://nbp.github.io/slides/HolyJit/JitTeamIntro/pictures/hj-overview.svg&quot; alt=&quot;HolyJit library instrumenting the Rust compiler to add a meta-Jit for Rust code.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/8b1881ead0b6&quot;&gt;a recent change&lt;/a&gt;, we extended the support of optimizations to Array.prototype.push. What should have been a trivial modification required diving into safety-critical code and adding 135 lines of code, and reading even more code to check that we were not accidentally breaking invariants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With HolyJit, what should have been a trivial change would effectively have been a trivial change. The following change to a hypothetical JS Jit built with HolyJit does exactly the same thing as &lt;a href=&quot;https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/8b1881ead0b6&quot;&gt;the previous patch&lt;/a&gt;, i.e. allowing the Jit to inline the Array.prototype.push function when it is being called with more than one argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 fn array_push(args: &amp;amp;CallArgs) -&amp;gt; Result&amp;lt;JSValue, Error&amp;gt; {
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
-    jit_inline_if!(args.len() == 1);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
+    jit_inline_if!(args.len() &amp;gt;= 1);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
     …
 }
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By making changes self-contained and simple, we hope that HolyJit will improve the safety of our Jit engine, and let us focus on optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Let’s write a simple Kernel (2014)</title>
<link>http://arjunsreedharan.org/post/82710718100/kernel-101-lets-write-a-kernel</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://arjunsreedharan.org/post/82710718100/kernel-101-lets-write-a-kernel</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Hello World,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us write a simple kernel which could be loaded with the GRUB bootloader on an x86 system. This kernel will display a message on the screen and then hang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.tumblr.com/gltvynn/MDYn443cj/one-does-not-kernel.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;One does simply write a kernel&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does an x86 machine boot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we think about writing a kernel, let’s see how the machine boots up and transfers control to the kernel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most registers of the x86 CPU have well defined values after power-on. The Instruction Pointer (EIP) register holds the memory address for the instruction being executed by the processor. EIP is hardcoded to the value &lt;strong&gt;0xFFFFFFF0&lt;/strong&gt;. Thus, the x86 CPU is hardwired to begin execution at the physical address 0xFFFFFFF0. It is in fact, the last 16 bytes of the 32-bit address space. This memory address is called reset vector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the chipset’s memory map makes sure that 0xFFFFFFF0 is mapped to a certain part of the BIOS, not to the RAM. Meanwhile, the BIOS copies itself to the RAM for faster access. This is called &lt;strong&gt;shadowing&lt;/strong&gt;. The address 0xFFFFFFF0 will contain just a jump instruction to the address in memory where BIOS has copied itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the BIOS code starts its execution.  BIOS first searches for a bootable device in the configured boot device order. It checks for a certain magic number to determine if the device is bootable or not. (whether bytes 511 and 512 of first sector are &lt;strong&gt;0xAA55&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the BIOS has found a bootable device, it copies the contents of the device’s first sector into RAM starting from physical address &lt;strong&gt;0x7c00&lt;/strong&gt;; and then jumps into the address and executes the code just loaded. This code is called the &lt;strong&gt;bootloader&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bootloader then loads the kernel at the physical address &lt;strong&gt;0x100000&lt;/strong&gt;. The address 0x100000 is used as the start-address for all big kernels on x86 machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All x86 processors begin in a simplistic 16-bit mode called &lt;strong&gt;real mode&lt;/strong&gt;. The GRUB bootloader makes the switch to 32-bit &lt;strong&gt;protected mode&lt;/strong&gt; by setting the lowest bit of &lt;code&gt;CR0&lt;/code&gt; register to &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;. Thus the kernel loads in 32-bit protected mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do note that in case of linux kernel, GRUB detects linux boot protocol and loads linux kernel in real mode. Linux kernel itself &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftorvalds%2Flinux%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Farch%2Fx86%2Fboot%2Fmain.c%23L181&amp;amp;t=MDA2YjZlNzUyOTlmYzNjOTEyYmE4ZTVjNzU0Y2FhZjQzNTlkOWFiYSxJVHNWb3BUUw%3D%3D&amp;amp;b=t%3AlMu0rOs9jGwbQo_qiwGh_A&amp;amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Farjunsreedharan.org%2Fpost%2F82710718100%2Fkernel-101-lets-write-a-kernel&amp;amp;m=1&quot; data-href=&quot;//github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/x86/boot/main.c#L181&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;makes the switch&lt;/a&gt; to protected mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What all do we need?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* An x86 computer (of course)&lt;br/&gt;* Linux&lt;br/&gt;* &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=%2F%2Fwww.nasm.us%2F&amp;amp;t=Y2E2OGRhMGZkYTc5OTBhZDM4MjU2ODU0NjdiODg0ZThkMTk2N2U3ZCxJVHNWb3BUUw%3D%3D&amp;amp;b=t%3AlMu0rOs9jGwbQo_qiwGh_A&amp;amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Farjunsreedharan.org%2Fpost%2F82710718100%2Fkernel-101-lets-write-a-kernel&amp;amp;m=1&quot; data-href=&quot;//www.nasm.us/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NASM assembler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* gcc&lt;br/&gt;* ld (GNU Linker)&lt;br/&gt;* grub&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source Code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source code is available at my &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Farjun024%2Fmkernel&amp;amp;t=MGJmMmY4Y2U0YWE0NGY1YmMzYjFjYmJkNTQwNTg4ODU2NzEyY2RhZSxJVHNWb3BUUw%3D%3D&amp;amp;b=t%3AlMu0rOs9jGwbQo_qiwGh_A&amp;amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Farjunsreedharan.org%2Fpost%2F82710718100%2Fkernel-101-lets-write-a-kernel&amp;amp;m=1&quot; data-href=&quot;//github.com/arjun024/mkernel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Github repository - mkernel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The entry point using assembly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We like to write everything in C, but we cannot avoid a little bit of assembly. We will write a small file in x86 assembly-language that serves as the starting point for our kernel. All our assembly file will do is invoke an external function which we will write in C, and then halt the program flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we make sure that this assembly code will serve as the starting point of the kernel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent5&quot;&gt;We will use a linker script that links the object files to produce the final kernel executable. (more explained later)  In this linker script, we will explicitly specify that we want our binary to be loaded at the address 0x100000. This address, as I have said earlier, is where the kernel is expected to be. Thus, the bootloader will take care of firing the kernel’s entry point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the assembly code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-asm&quot;&gt;
;;kernel.asm
bits 32                 ;nasm directive - 32 bit
section .text

global start
extern kmain            ;kmain is defined in the c file

start:
  cli                   ;block interrupts
  mov esp, stack_space  ;set stack pointer
  call kmain
  hlt                   ;halt the CPU

section .bss
resb 8192               ;8KB for stack
stack_space:
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first instruction &lt;code&gt;bits 32&lt;/code&gt; is not an x86 assembly instruction. It’s a directive to the NASM assembler that specifies it should generate code to run on a processor operating in 32 bit mode. It is not mandatorily required in our example, however is included here as it’s good practice to be explicit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second line begins the text section (aka code section). This is where we put all our code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;global&lt;/code&gt; is another NASM directive to set symbols from source code as global. By doing so, the linker knows where the symbol &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; is; which happens to be our entry point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;kmain&lt;/code&gt; is our function that will be defined in our &lt;code&gt;kernel.c&lt;/code&gt; file. &lt;code&gt;extern&lt;/code&gt; declares that the function is declared elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we have the &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; function, which calls the &lt;code&gt;kmain&lt;/code&gt; function and halts the CPU using the &lt;code&gt;hlt&lt;/code&gt; instruction. Interrupts can awake the CPU from an &lt;code&gt;hlt&lt;/code&gt; instruction. So we disable interrupts beforehand using &lt;code&gt;cli&lt;/code&gt; instruction. &lt;code&gt;cli&lt;/code&gt; is short for clear-interrupts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should ideally set aside some memory for the stack and point the stack pointer (&lt;code&gt;esp&lt;/code&gt;) to it. However, it seems like GRUB does this for us and the stack pointer is already set at this point. But, just to be sure, we will allocate some space in the BSS section and point the stack pointer to the beginning of the allocated memory. We use the &lt;code&gt;resb&lt;/code&gt; instruction which reserves memory given in bytes. After it, a label is left which will point to the edge of the reserved piece of memory. Just before the &lt;code&gt;kmain&lt;/code&gt; is called, the stack pointer (&lt;code&gt;esp&lt;/code&gt;) is made to point to this space using the &lt;code&gt;mov&lt;/code&gt; instruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The kernel in C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;kernel.asm&lt;/code&gt;, we made a call to the function &lt;code&gt;kmain()&lt;/code&gt;. So our C code will start executing at &lt;code&gt;kmain()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
/*
*  kernel.c
*/
void kmain(void)
{
        const char *str = &quot;my first kernel&quot;;
        char *vidptr = (char*)0xb8000;  //video mem begins here.
        unsigned int i = 0;
        unsigned int j = 0;

        /* this loops clears the screen
        * there are 25 lines each of 80 columns; each element takes 2 bytes */
        while(j &amp;lt; 80 * 25 * 2) {
                /* blank character */
                vidptr[j] = ' ';
                /* attribute-byte - light grey on black screen */
                vidptr[j+1] = 0x07;             
                j = j + 2;
        }

        j = 0;

        /* this loop writes the string to video memory */
        while(str[j] != '\0') {
                /* the character's ascii */
                vidptr[i] = str[j];
                /* attribute-byte: give character black bg and light grey fg */
                vidptr[i+1] = 0x07;
                ++j;
                i = i + 2;
        }
        return;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All our kernel will do is clear the screen and write to it the string “my first kernel”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we make a pointer &lt;code&gt;vidptr&lt;/code&gt; that points to the address &lt;strong&gt;0xb8000&lt;/strong&gt;. This address is the start of video memory in protected mode. The screen’s text memory is simply a chunk of memory in our address space. The memory mapped input/output for the screen starts at 0xb8000 and supports 25 lines, each line contain 80 ascii characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each character element in this text memory is represented by 16 bits (2 bytes), rather than 8 bits (1 byte) which we are used to.  The first byte should have the representation of the character as in ASCII. The second byte is the &lt;code&gt;attribute-byte&lt;/code&gt;. This describes the formatting of the character including attributes such as color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To print the character &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; in green color on black background, we will store the character &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; in the first byte of the video memory address and the value 0x02 in the second byte.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; represents black background and &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; represents green foreground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have a look at table below for different colors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
0 - Black, 1 - Blue, 2 - Green, 3 - Cyan, 4 - Red, 5 - Magenta, 6 - Brown, 7 - Light Grey, 8 - Dark Grey, 9 - Light Blue, 10/a - Light Green, 11/b - Light Cyan, 12/c - Light Red, 13/d - Light Magenta, 14/e - Light Brown, 15/f – White.
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our kernel, we will use light grey character on a black background. So our attribute-byte must have the value 0x07.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first while loop, the program writes the blank character with 0x07 attribute all over the 80 columns of the 25 lines. This thus clears the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second while loop, characters of the null terminated string “my first kernel” are written to the chunk of video memory with each character holding an attribute-byte of 0x07.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should display the string on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The linking part&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will assemble &lt;code&gt;kernel.asm&lt;/code&gt; with NASM to an object file; and then using GCC we will compile &lt;code&gt;kernel.c&lt;/code&gt; to another object file. Now, our job is to get these objects linked to an executable bootable kernel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For that, we use an explicit linker script, which can be passed as an argument to &lt;code&gt;ld&lt;/code&gt; (our linker).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-ld&quot;&gt;
/*
*  link.ld
*/
OUTPUT_FORMAT(elf32-i386)
ENTRY(start)
SECTIONS
 {
   . = 0x100000;
   .text : { *(.text) }
   .data : { *(.data) }
   .bss  : { *(.bss)  }
 }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we set the &lt;strong&gt;output format&lt;/strong&gt; of our output executable to be 32 bit &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=%2F%2Felinux.org%2FExecutable_and_Linkable_Format_%28ELF%29&amp;amp;t=MjhkN2Y5MjdlMGIxZTI0MGMyZWIyYTFlNTk5ZTRiZjU0ZTQ0OWNlMixJVHNWb3BUUw%3D%3D&amp;amp;b=t%3AlMu0rOs9jGwbQo_qiwGh_A&amp;amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Farjunsreedharan.org%2Fpost%2F82710718100%2Fkernel-101-lets-write-a-kernel&amp;amp;m=1&quot; data-href=&quot;//elinux.org/Executable_and_Linkable_Format_(ELF)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Executable and Linkable Format&lt;/a&gt; (ELF). ELF is the standard binary file format for Unix-like systems on x86 architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENTRY&lt;/strong&gt; takes one argument. It specifies the symbol name that should be the entry point of our executable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SECTIONS&lt;/strong&gt; is the most important part for us. Here, we define the layout of our executable. We could specify how the different sections are to be merged and at what location each of these is to be placed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the braces that follow the SECTIONS statement, the period character (.) represents the &lt;strong&gt;location counter&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;The location counter is always initialized to 0x0 at beginning of the SECTIONS block. It can be modified by assigning a new value to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, earlier I told you that kernel’s code should start at the address 0x100000. So, we set the location counter to 0x100000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have look at the next line &lt;strong&gt;.text : { *(.text) }&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The asterisk (*) is a wildcard character that matches any file name. The expression &lt;code&gt;*(.text)&lt;/code&gt; thus means all &lt;code&gt;.text&lt;/code&gt; input sections from all input files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the linker merges all text sections of the object files to the executable’s text section, at the address stored in the location counter. Thus, the code section of our executable begins at 0x100000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the linker places the text output section, the value of the location counter will become&lt;br/&gt;0x1000000 + the size of the text output section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the data and bss sections are merged and placed at the then values of location-counter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grub and Multiboot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we have all our files ready to build the kernel. But, since we like to boot our kernel with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=%2F%2Fwww.gnu.org%2Fsoftware%2Fgrub%2F&amp;amp;t=ODNhYTQ5OTM5NDg5ZjYxNjExOTUxYWM1MTc1ZDMzMGFiNDU5ODVmYixJVHNWb3BUUw%3D%3D&amp;amp;b=t%3AlMu0rOs9jGwbQo_qiwGh_A&amp;amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Farjunsreedharan.org%2Fpost%2F82710718100%2Fkernel-101-lets-write-a-kernel&amp;amp;m=1&quot; data-href=&quot;//www.gnu.org/software/grub/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GRUB bootloader&lt;/a&gt;, there is one step left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a standard for loading various x86 kernels using a boot loader; called as &lt;strong&gt;Multiboot specification&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GRUB will only load our kernel if it complies with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=%2F%2Fwww.gnu.org%2Fsoftware%2Fgrub%2Fmanual%2Fmultiboot%2Fmultiboot.html&amp;amp;t=MjBlYjFlNGZlYmNjMzBmZTFiMjNmMGJhYTJhOGIyZGQzZGMwNWQ4YyxJVHNWb3BUUw%3D%3D&amp;amp;b=t%3AlMu0rOs9jGwbQo_qiwGh_A&amp;amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Farjunsreedharan.org%2Fpost%2F82710718100%2Fkernel-101-lets-write-a-kernel&amp;amp;m=1&quot; data-href=&quot;//www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/multiboot/multiboot.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Multiboot spec&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the spec, the kernel must contain a header (known as Multiboot header) within its first 8 KiloBytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, This Multiboot header must contain 3 fields that are 4 byte aligned namely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a &lt;strong&gt;magic&lt;/strong&gt; field: containing the magic number &lt;strong&gt;0x1BADB002&lt;/strong&gt;, to identify the header.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a &lt;strong&gt;flags&lt;/strong&gt; field: We will not care about this field. We will simply set it to zero.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a &lt;strong&gt;checksum&lt;/strong&gt; field: the checksum field when added to the fields ‘magic’ and ‘flags’ must give zero.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So our &lt;code&gt;kernel.asm&lt;/code&gt; will become:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-asm&quot;&gt;
;;kernel.asm

;nasm directive - 32 bit
bits 32
section .text
        ;multiboot spec
        align 4
        dd 0x1BADB002            ;magic
        dd 0x00                  ;flags
        dd - (0x1BADB002 + 0x00) ;checksum. m+f+c should be zero

global start
extern kmain            ;kmain is defined in the c file

start:
  cli                   ;block interrupts
  mov esp, stack_space  ;set stack pointer
  call kmain
  hlt                   ;halt the CPU

section .bss
resb 8192               ;8KB for stack
stack_space:
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;dd&lt;/strong&gt; defines a double word of size 4 bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building the kernel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will now create object files from &lt;code&gt;kernel.asm&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;kernel.c&lt;/code&gt; and then link it using our linker script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-sh&quot;&gt;
nasm -f elf32 kernel.asm -o kasm.o
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;will run the assembler to create the object file kasm.o in ELF-32 bit format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-sh&quot;&gt;
gcc -m32 -c kernel.c -o kc.o
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ’-c ’ option makes sure that after compiling, linking doesn’t implicitly happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-sh&quot;&gt;
ld -m elf_i386 -T link.ld -o kernel kasm.o kc.o
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;will run the linker with our linker script and generate the executable named &lt;strong&gt;kernel&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Configure your grub and run your kernel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GRUB requires your kernel to be of the name pattern &lt;code&gt;kernel-&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. So, rename the kernel. I renamed my kernel executable to kernel-701.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now place it in the &lt;strong&gt;/boot&lt;/strong&gt; directory. You will require superuser privileges to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your GRUB configuration file &lt;code&gt;grub.cfg&lt;/code&gt; you should add an entry, something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
title myKernel
        root (hd0,0)
        kernel /boot/kernel-701 ro
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget to remove the directive &lt;code&gt;hiddenmenu&lt;/code&gt; if it exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reboot your computer, and you’ll get a list selection with the name of your kernel listed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select it and you should see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.tumblr.com/gltvynn/yOdn443dr/mkernel.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s your kernel!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
* It’s always advisable to get yourself a virtual machine for all kinds of kernel hacking. * To run this on &lt;strong&gt;grub2 &lt;/strong&gt;which is the default bootloader for newer distros, your config should look like this:
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
menuentry 'kernel 7001' {
        set root='hd0,msdos1'
        multiboot /boot/kernel-7001 ro
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

* Also, if you want to run the kernel on the &lt;code&gt;qemu&lt;/code&gt; emulator instead of booting with GRUB, you can do so by:
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-sh&quot;&gt;
qemu-system-i386 -kernel kernel
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, see the next article in the Kernel series:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://arjunsreedharan.org/post/99370248137/kernel-201-lets-write-a-kernel-with-keyboard-and&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kernel 201 - Let’s write a Kernel with keyboard and screen support&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Writing a Bootloader</title>
<link>http://3zanders.co.uk/2017/10/13/writing-a-bootloader/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://3zanders.co.uk/2017/10/13/writing-a-bootloader/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This article series explains how to write a tiny 32-bit x86 operating system kernel. We won’t do very much other than print &lt;code&gt;Hello world!&lt;/code&gt; to the screen in increasingly complicated ways! We’ll start off in assembly and then build up to writing C++!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://3zanders.co.uk/2017/10/13/writing-a-bootloader/writingabootloader.pdf&quot;&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt; of this article series is also available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To follow along you’re going to need the NASM assembler and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qemu.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;QEMU&lt;/a&gt; to emulate a virtual machine for us. QEMU is great because you don’t have to worry about accidentally destroying your hardware with badly written OS code ;) You can install these on &lt;a href=&quot;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/commandline/wsl/install_guide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Windows Subsystem for Linux&lt;/a&gt; or Ubuntu with this command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;built_in&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; apt-get install nasm qemu
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a mac you can use homebrew:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;brew &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; nasm&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;A_Hello_World_Bootloader&quot;&gt;A Hello World Bootloader&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you press the power button the computer loads the BIOS from some flash memory stored on the motherboard. The BIOS initializes and self tests the hardware then loads the first 512 bytes into memory from the media device (i.e. the cdrom or floppy disk). If the last two bytes equal &lt;code&gt;0xAA55&lt;/code&gt; then the BIOS will jump to location &lt;code&gt;0x7C00&lt;/code&gt; effectively transferring control to the bootloader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point the CPU is running in 16 bit mode, meaning only the 16 bit registers are available. Also since the BIOS only loads the first 512 bytes this means our bootloader code has to stay below that limit, otherwise we’ll hit uninitialised memory!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s get hello world printing to the screen. To do this we’re going to use the ‘Write Character in TTY mode’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS_interrupt_call&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;BIOS Interrupt Call&lt;/a&gt; and the load string byte instruction &lt;code&gt;lobsb&lt;/code&gt; which loads byte at address &lt;code&gt;ds:si&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;al&lt;/code&gt;. Here goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;built_in&quot;&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt; 
org &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0x7c00&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;label&quot;&gt;boot:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;si&lt;/span&gt;,hello 
    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;ah&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0x0e&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;string&quot;&gt;.loop&lt;/span&gt;:
    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;lodsb&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;al&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;al&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;jz&lt;/span&gt; halt  
    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0x10&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;jmp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;string&quot;&gt;.loop&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;label&quot;&gt;halt:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;cli&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;hlt&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;label&quot;&gt;hello:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pseudo&quot;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;string&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello world!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pseudo&quot;&gt;times&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;510&lt;/span&gt; - ($-$$) &lt;span class=&quot;pseudo&quot;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;pseudo&quot;&gt;dw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0xaa55&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you save this file as &lt;code&gt;boot1.asm&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;a href=&quot;http://3zanders.co.uk/2017/10/13/writing-a-bootloader/boot1.asm&quot;&gt;download it here&lt;/a&gt;) we can now use &lt;code&gt;nasm&lt;/code&gt; to compile it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;nasm &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;-f&lt;/span&gt; bin boot1.asm -o boot1.bin
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we run &lt;code&gt;hexdump boot1.bin&lt;/code&gt; we can see that NASM created some code, padded some zeros then set the final two bytes to the magic number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

<title>What you should know as a founder of a software company</title>

<description>&lt;img class=&quot;img-headline img-responsive center-block&quot; src=&quot;https://qotoqot.com/blog/founder-skills/img/many-hats.png&quot; srcset=&quot;img/many-hats_2x.png 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;by Ivan Mir on Oct 18, 2017&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a business is like roaming in a fog: you often feel like you have no idea where exactly you are going or what to do next. What seemed simple turns into weeks-long research, with dozens of opened browser tabs full of jargon, self-promotion and contradictory advice. It would be nice to have some kind of a map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this guide I outline what we have learned during our years of running independent development studios and a startup. I also include lists of resources for further reading. We are not affiliated with any of the linked persons and companies and the links are not referrals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-h2 img-responsive center-block&quot; src=&quot;https://qotoqot.com/blog/founder-skills/img/druid.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/blog/founder-skills/img/druid_2x.png 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;zero-top-margin&quot;&gt;UX design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weak &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/definition-user-experience/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;user experience design&lt;/a&gt; makes people hate your product. Big companies can get away with it because their clients often have no other choice, but it’s a crucial point for a new market player. Likewise, you probably know companies that beat competitors by providing a better experience and paying more attention to details. This is why being good at UX design leads to more business opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User experience does not just mean “an obvious UI.” It describes all the interaction between a customer and a product — from texts on a landing page to support requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7.9879518072289&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first requirement for an exemplary user experience is to meet the exact needs of the customer, without fuss or bother. Next comes simplicity and elegance that produce products that are a joy to own, a joy to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Don Norman and Jakob Nielsen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UX design is hard to get right because it requires an understanding of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcodesign.com/1671735/infographic-the-intricate-anatomy-of-ux-design&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dozens of fields&lt;/a&gt;, at least at the basic level. And since it’s rooted in cultural norms and psychology, it’s prone to subtle mistakes. What makes it even harder is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;curse of knowledge&lt;/a&gt;: it’s not possible to use and feel your own creations like a person who is seeing them for the first time and has no assumptions about the available features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming a good UX designer means developing a special kind of empathy that allows you to understand the user’s needs while reducing the effects of the curse of knowledge. One of the best ways to do it is to watch people interacting with your prototypes without giving them any hints. It’s a frustrating but insightful process because you can learn others’ perceptions and your own biases at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst offense for a UX designer is doing something different for the sake of being unique. You should be following the established design patterns and copy great products when possible. More experienced teams have already spent a lot of time and money on experiments to polish their UX, so it would be unwise to ignore their findings. Eventually, you’ll get skilled enough to innovate on your own, but it’s better not to rush it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;resources&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-h2 img-responsive center-block&quot; src=&quot;https://qotoqot.com/blog/founder-skills/img/alchemist.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/blog/founder-skills/img/alchemist_2x.png 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;zero-top-margin&quot;&gt;Visual design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever used a product that worked nicely but looked unprofessional or outdated? In the last few years, design has become an arms race. Trends change each year, and big companies push redesign after redesign to keep their products looking fresh. But as a side effect, this tendency has made good visual design accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays it’s easy to get amazing stock templates for less than $50 instead of spending thousands on a custom design. Of course, you aren’t getting a truly unique look, but it would be unwise to waste the limited resources a company has at the beginning. Most of your customers won’t actually care about design exclusivity as long as it looks professional and solves their problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to have any actual design skills, but develop a sense of good design. Spending half an hour weekly on relevant digests and discussions is enough to train your perception. See what professionals praise and what they criticize, Think about what’s missing and how something can be improved. There are no secret hacks to become good fast — only gradual improvement from a constant attention to detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch out for trends. Some visual elements and styles get too popular and overused, resulting in indistinguishable experiences. For example, there are countless apps with a “single letter on flat color background” icon or sites using a “full-width stock photo with large text” header. Being too similar to everybody else does not benefit a new brand, and it’s always possible to create some individuality even when using stock templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the main pitfall of visual design is focusing on form instead of function. If the visual part does not comply with the UX design, a product may end up being good eye candy but also confusing. No amount of “but it will look better” can justify poor usability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;resources-1&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-h2 img-responsive center-block&quot; src=&quot;https://qotoqot.com/blog/founder-skills/img/cleric.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/blog/founder-skills/img/cleric_2x.png 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;zero-top-margin&quot;&gt;Customer support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing unread emails in the support folder always gives me chills. What’s in there? A short question about UI or a complex bug that I’ll be fighting for days? What if somebody lost all the data and got angry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support is demanding: you need to respond fast, write well, come up with solutions to tricky problems and stay cool when a customer writes something unpleasant. The younger your product, the more people will contact you due to UX issues and bugs. After a successful launch, it may take days until you’ll have time for anything but replying to support emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As entrepreneurs, we have the advantage of not being a faceless corporation. We can provide more human interaction and less friction when sophisticated problems arise. We are nimble. Even big enterprise customers &lt;a href=&quot;https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/enterprise_sales&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;prefer this flexibility&lt;/a&gt;, so there is no need to try to look larger than you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6.4010695187166&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customers love talking to founders: they’re transparently passionate about the product and always, always have an answer at their fingertips or know how to get one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kalzumeus.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Patrick McKenzie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foundation of great support is simple: put your customers first. That doesn’t mean agreeing to every feature request; just have sympathy for their problems and show a sincere willingness to help. Even if some of them decide to pass on your product, this is the way to build a great brand reputation and a more caring world as a bonus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;resources-2&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-h2 img-responsive center-block&quot; src=&quot;https://qotoqot.com/blog/founder-skills/img/merchant.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/blog/founder-skills/img/merchant_2x.png 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;zero-top-margin&quot;&gt;Marketing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel any negative emotions towards this word, it’s totally understandable. The field is filled with people who are trying to prey on others’ insecurities and use shady practices, but becoming one of them is not a requirement for entry unless your product itself is dishonest and targets insecurities. Openness and honesty can still win you customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketing is often confused with promotion, but promotion is only a part of it. The other parts are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;product, price and place&lt;/a&gt;. Marketing means understanding how a product interacts with the market. This is why it should start &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; development to prevent wasting months of work on nonviable ideas. For example, start by researching answers to these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who is my audience? How can I reach them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have I solved a problem serious enough for people to bother to become my customers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What should be the pricing? Are there enough potential customers to make it profitable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I outdo my competitors? Wait, why is there no competition?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to promotion, there is a dangerous myth that good products can spread by word of mouth. While it could be true in some rare “viral” cases, most products can’t get any meaningful visibility this way because even the most loyal customers don’t go out of their way to recommend software to others. Also, there will be many potential customers who have a problem that your product solves, but they won’t know unless you show them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10.465277777778&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s also this idea, especially in technology, that if you create something that’s really unique and cool, something that’s special, that people automatically flock to it. I think people only use products for one reason and that’s to make their lives better.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinjackson.ca&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Justin Jackson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to promotion success is understanding the best channels for your product and focusing your attention on those. For software, these channels are usually email and content marketing, while social networks are a waste of time until you have a considerable advertising budget (but running ad campaigns is a whole science unto itself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, no dirty tricks involved. You have a useful product and plan a strategy to reach out to the people who will benefit from using it. When in doubt, just don’t use marketing methods on others that you wouldn’t want used on yourself. This approach has worked well for us so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;resources-3&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-h2 img-responsive center-block&quot; src=&quot;https://qotoqot.com/blog/founder-skills/img/ninja.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/blog/founder-skills/img/ninja_2x.png 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;zero-top-margin&quot;&gt;SEO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another term that often raises negative associations, but it's nothing but a set of rules on how to make your site more visible in search engines. How often do you go beyond the first page of the search results? An average user &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.advancedwebranking.com/cloud/ctrstudy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rarely clicks on anything below the top five&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But can you even get to the first page? Beating the whole marketing departments of big competitors could be close to impossible. This is why, just like general marketing, your SEO strategy should be planned &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; starting the development. And &quot;organic&quot; traffic from search is the key to survival for most products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, search engines want three things from a site to show it in the top results: relevance, quality and authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relevance and quality are the &quot;easy&quot; parts. That means writing helpful articles that will attract visitors from &lt;a href=&quot;https://ahrefs.com/blog/long-tail-keywords/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;long-tail search queries&lt;/a&gt; and doing technical improvements to make everything load quickly. But just the content and optimizations can't bring a site to the top for popular keywords if it doesn't have authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaining authority is hard. It requires links to your site from sites that are already authoritative. Anything like comments, profile links or paid posts do not count (these are &quot;nofollow&quot; links that are ignored in search engine ranking). So you need to reach out to the owners of good sites and ask them to link to your content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that these people are getting dozens if not hundreds of &quot;link building&quot; requests daily in their inboxes. The average quality of such emails is not much different than regular spam: they aren't personalized, they're made with worn-out templates and they instantly ask to link to some generic stuff. It's &lt;a href=&quot;https://moz.com/blog/earn-links-directly&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;still possible&lt;/a&gt; to capture someone's interest with great relevant content (more on this in the &quot;Writing&quot; part), an interesting subject line and a short, clear pitch, but even a 5% reply rate should be considered a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;19.337016574586&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I think that most of the web at this point is sort of burned out on this conversation of, &quot;Hey, I have this great resource.&quot; Or, &quot;Hey, you linked to this thing which is currently broken and so maybe you'd like to,&quot; or &quot;Hey, I noticed that you frequently mention or link to blah, blah, blah. Well I have a blah, blah, blah like blah, blah, blah.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;https://moz.com/blog/earn-links-directly&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rand Fishkin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a small business, hiring a top SEO professional &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kalzumeus.com/2008/01/28/why-you-shouldnt-pay-any-seo-you-can-afford/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;is not an option&lt;/a&gt;. People who can &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; bring a site to the top of search results usually work with budgets many times larger than you can afford when bootstrapping. It's possible to outsource the tedious process of link building but finding a good agency is a tough task. Don't hire cheap ones, either, because they can damage your rankings by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.authorityhacker.com/link-building-services/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;adding links to spam sites&lt;/a&gt; or alienate site owners with poorly written messages. The SEO market is full of scam, so when in doubt, better stay away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;resources-4&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-h2 img-responsive center-block&quot; src=&quot;https://qotoqot.com/blog/founder-skills/img/ranger.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/blog/founder-skills/img/ranger_2x.png 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;zero-top-margin&quot;&gt;Press outreach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not that different from link building except that journalists receive even more trash in their inboxes and have even less time to look into it. Again, the good PR services that have personal contacts with reporters are too expensive for most of us (decent ones charge at least $7,000 to $10,000 per month). The average ones will do the same thing that you can do but for a high price. The bad ones will mass-send template emails and ruin your relationship with the press. Also, journalists prefer to talk with developers instead of PR people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success in press outreach is totally situational. It depends on the product's niche, novelty, current market trends or even an interesting story behind the development. But the press attention itself is not everything. Lots of readers will check out your site but most of them will just look around and leave. Next week comes, and you are not the news anymore, so the visits will flatline. Of course it's still good to get coverage, but many products get little to zero of it, so it's better to prepare for the worst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5.5491329479769&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is no secret to getting press. Even the most press-savvy entrepreneurs and PR executives have horror stories of botched launches and ignored pitches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;https://jasonkincaid.net&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jason Kincaid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding the right reporters is time consuming but easy. Look for the ones who wrote about competitors or similar products before and still write on this topic (journalists change jobs and &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_reporting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;beats&lt;/a&gt;&quot; relatively often). The most effective way to do it is to find backlinks to other products' pages by using trials of SEO tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://moz.com/researchtools/ose/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Moz&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://ahrefs.com/site-explorer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ahrefs&lt;/a&gt;. After exporting the results to spreadsheets, there will be at least a couple of evenings of going through the articles on worthwhile sites and trying to find the authors' contact information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing a pitch isn't fast, either. It will take many iterations to fit everything important into a short email and craft a precisely clear message. Here are some basic rules for a decent pitch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A subject that sounds like a news headline, 45 to 55 characters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A maximum pitch length of 100 to 120 words&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greet reporters by name, mention their previous articles (but no flattery)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bit about your company (but no bragging or narcissism)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What problem does your product solve? Why might their readers care?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who are the competitors? How is your product better?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Link to a press kit page (not archived, not a press release)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sent at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/buzzstream/500-writers-editors-reveal-what-they-look-for-in-a-pitch&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;right time&lt;/a&gt; (email scheduling is helpful)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mind you, there are dozens of pitfalls that can't fit into this post but can seriously affect your relationship with journalists. I highly recommend skipping any guides written by PR professionals and instead read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NFAT238/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Burned-Out Blogger's Guide to PR&lt;/a&gt;, which is a first-hand tech reporter's experience in the industry. It will give you all the necessary insights to do quality press outreach by yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;resources-5&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-h2 img-responsive center-block&quot; src=&quot;https://qotoqot.com/blog/founder-skills/img/bard.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/blog/founder-skills/img/bard_2x.png 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;zero-top-margin&quot;&gt;Writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do anything in online business there's no other option but to write well. We live in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;attention economy&lt;/a&gt; where your words compete with finely optimized click-bait pieces and endless mobile notifications. If your headings are not capturing attention or your articles are hard to read or their message is not relevant to the reader, then your product's conversion rates will reflect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far the UX design, support and marketing have all been about the customers. Writing is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-centric-language/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;also about them&lt;/a&gt;, and this is where many companies fail by being narcissistic. No matter if it's landing-page copy or a blog post, it must be centered on the reader's needs and problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9.7538461538462&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lists of service or product features don’t attract readers, because the terms and phrases used to describe them aren’t easily understandable — especially if the feature names include branded terms. Users want to know what the product or service will do for them, and they don’t care about the fancy name.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-centric-language/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NN Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great product with an amazing site often can't get enough backlinks (as mentioned in the SEO part above) — especially when going against big and established competitors with tens of thousands of links to their sites! Nowadays it's almost necessary to do &quot;content marketing&quot; – that is, the creation of relevant content on a company's site to attract more links and visitors. While the content may be freebies, tools or infographics, usually it is articles on topics relevant to the interests of your customers. Some great examples: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.groovehq.com/blog/how-we-built-a-5m-business-with-content-marketing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Groove&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.helpscout.net/blog/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Help Scout&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/community/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing is the part where non-native English speakers like me are in a disadvantaged position. What can really help you progress to an advanced level is switching everything to English: news, entertainment, online communities, documents and personal notes. Five years ago I was writing in English slowly, mostly in grammatically incorrect sentences, and constantly checking the dictionary. But lots of practice outside of your comfort zone can get everybody on a decent level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;resources-6&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-h2 img-responsive center-block&quot; src=&quot;https://qotoqot.com/blog/founder-skills/img/wizard.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/blog/founder-skills/img/wizard_2x.png 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;zero-top-margin&quot;&gt;Tech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tech industry has gotten to the point where it's overwhelming even if you follow it closely. There is no way that I can give any meaningful introduction to it here, but there are certain best practices for managing development as an entrepreneur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the visual representation directed by UX design, the underlying technology must be constrained by business goals. When doing the development yourself, it is easy to slip into a false productivity when you increase the amount of code without achieving your business goals. The most infamous examples are building tools instead of a product or overthinking a complicated architecture &quot;for the future.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8.5308056872038&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The best code is no code at all. Every new line of code you willingly bring into the world is code that has to be debugged, code that has to be read and understood, code that has to be supported.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.codinghorror.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jeff Atwood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more danger is following the hype. New and trendy technology usually means bugs, breaking changes, immature tooling and lack of documentation. &quot;Boring&quot; mature tech will allow you to achieve the same goals much faster and make it easy to find developers for hire. After all, Stack Overflow itself was &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/2008/09/21/what-was-stack-overflow-built-with/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;built with ASP.NET&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are coming from a development background, focus on the UX design and marketing first because the technical part will be easy for you to handle. It should not be buggy, but mediocre implementation and good marketing will bring you many times more customers than good implementation and mediocre marketing. The market doesn't care what's under the hood as long as it works and solves problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;resources-7&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-h2 img-responsive center-block&quot; src=&quot;https://qotoqot.com/blog/founder-skills/img/knight.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/blog/founder-skills/img/knight_2x.png 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;zero-top-margin&quot;&gt;Laws &amp;amp; accounting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the country, your experience with these business aspects can range from mildly unpleasant to the absolute worst. Often the best source of information about the nuances of an online business will be the local startup and freelance communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some places dealing with international money transfers can be a real pain: hours in banks to clear it with paperwork and a mess of tax rules for doing business with foreign entities. But when working as an individual you can rely on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.payoneer.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Payoneer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://transferwise.com/borderless&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TransferWise Borderless account&lt;/a&gt; for a while. Business accounting is also more complex, so consult a local accountant to see if it might be beneficial to postpone incorporation in your case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need for a lawyer depends on the product's niche. If it has anything to do with copyrighted content or regulated industries like finances and medicine, then consulting before starting the development is a must. Otherwise, generic terms &lt;a href=&quot;https://termsfeed.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;generated with templates&lt;/a&gt; are usually good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-through&quot;&gt;Getting through&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with this amount of information and tasks is challenging. The approach to learning itself should be different from how we learn to pass exams or interviews: focus on becoming a generalist with a broad perspective instead of a master in one field. It's not like deep knowledge is undesirable, but being an entrepreneur requires constantly compromising on what you can fit in the available time without burning out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final piece of advice, try to fail early and always have a backup plan to continue with your life after a failure. It's a bit of a lottery because of the luck factor involved. Getting all the numbers right is not guaranteed to anyone, so stay prepared and be easy on yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>University of Chicago Graduate Students Vote to Unionize</title>
<link>https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2017/10/19/graduate-student-unionization-uchicago-nlrb/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2017/10/19/graduate-student-unionization-uchicago-nlrb/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated story &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2017/10/20/gsu-celebrates-win-admin-says-legal-fight-continue/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of Chicago graduate students have voted to unionize by an overwhelming margin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1,103 “yes” votes were counted, exceeding the combined 479 counted “no” votes and the 149 votes that were challenged. The two-day election closed Wednesday at 9 p.m. Votes were counted at the NLRB regional headquarters downtown Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University is one of a dozen schools to host graduate student unionization votes since an NLRB decision August before last reopened the possibility. Several of these universities have continued legal challenges and refused to bargain after successful union votes. The University had filed to block this week’s vote, in part because a new Trump-era majority on the NLRB might again move to block graduate student unionization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graduate Students United tweeted, “We have a union. And we have a room full of joyously crying &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/UChicago&quot;&gt;@UChicago&lt;/a&gt; grad workers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/YESGSU?src=hash&quot;&gt;#YESGSU”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Maroon&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2017/10/19/graduate-students-say-casting-unionization-votes/&quot;&gt;spoke to graduate students&lt;/a&gt; at the polls Tuesday and Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pro-unionization graduate student described how she viewed the stakes: “A lot of us are living in almost poverty conditions; we’re really overworked, the school’s not very supportive—it’s been great to have this group of grad students coming together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The administration argued for months that a union would not be in the best interests of graduate students. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2017/10/17/october-15-unionization-e-mail-vice-provost-nirenb/&quot;&gt;e-mail&lt;/a&gt; from Executive Vice Provost David Nirenberg on Sunday cautioned that unionization would introduce a “third party” that could interfere with graduate students’ relationships with the University.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*uC8nGtvuK2jkDjazMoDx3A.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;640&quot; data-height=&quot;480&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*uC8nGtvuK2jkDjazMoDx3A.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*uC8nGtvuK2jkDjazMoDx3A.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;87f3&quot; id=&quot;87f3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Foo Camp, the original unconference thrown by O’Reilly every year, is one of my favorite events in the technology world. In many ways, it’s often felt like one of the safest — it welcomes crazy ideas, breaks down social barriers, starts cross disciplinary conversations. Their format encourages people to contribute to sessions, or leave them, not if they’re angry, but just if they’re not getting much out of it or have much to contribute. People bounce around the space and ideas and conversations, and so many of the normal social distances break down into collaboration. This format is creative, and gave me access to both people and ideas that helped me shape my work and get it in front of a wider audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2066&quot; id=&quot;2066&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Where it is not as safe as I’d like is in sexual harassment — though to be clear, it’s not worse than any other tech conference. It’s just even more upsetting given the warmth and openness and honesty of the event in other ways. At one of my first talks on body hacking, one of the creators of VisiCalc sat in the front row and yelled out sexually explicit questions at me while everyone, not just me, grew increasingly uncomfortable. I avoided him after that, but these were attitudes you couldn’t avoid anywhere in tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;54af&quot; id=&quot;54af&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In the early 2010s I was standing by the campfire on the Saturday night of Foo and a man was making out with a woman. Both were obviously drunk. Foo fosters a casual atmosphere, especially at night, and drinking is not uncommon. The making out was pretty weird though, and uncomfortable. I and some other friends chatted about it, loudly, about how it wasn’t appropriate here, but the pair went on anyway, either not hearing us or not caring. One of my friends was getting a bit upset, and managed to break things up by starting a conversation with the woman, but before long the pair were back at it. He came back to me, on the verge of panic, and whispered in my ear. The woman was so drunkenly disoriented that she didn’t seem to understand what was happening, and the guy kept pouring drinks for her. It was quite possibly headed towards rape. He asked me what to do, and I realized the man in question was someone powerful. I blanked and said I wasn’t sure what to do, maybe try get them apart? My friend gave me a fantastic no-duh look and went back over to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0504&quot; id=&quot;0504&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;At one point when they were separated the man in question was standing beside me at the camp fire. The person on the other side of me nervously decided to introduce us. It went roughly: “Robert, this is Quinn Norton. Quinn, this is Robert Scoble, he’s dangerous.” Scoble laughed and quickly said he wasn’t dangerous. I looked at him, keeping a blank expression, and said “I am.” I had learned this attitude after many years working in tech, that knowing how to deliver pain and putting everyone on notice that you would, was a way to avoid harassment. I knew this was fucked up, but it had been my normal for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;dc09&quot; id=&quot;dc09&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;And then, without any more warning, Scoble was on me. I felt one hand on my breast and his arm reaching around and grabbing my butt. Scoble is considerably bigger than I am, and I realized quickly I wasn’t going to be able to push him away. Meanwhile, the people around just watched, in what I can only imagine was stunned shock. I got a hand free and used a palm strike to the base of his chin to knock him back. It worked, he flew back and struggled to get his feet under him. I watched his feet carefully for that moment. He was unbalanced from the alcohol and I realized if he reached for me again I could pull him forward, bounce his face off my knee, then drive it into the ground. (I knew this move because it had been done to me, then the martial arts expert who did it picked me up and apologetically showed me how to do it.) He laughed and rubbed his chin and said something like “I like this one, she has spirit.” I said this: “If you touch me again I will break your nose.” I could still feel his hands on me, his intentions, all of it. He laughed again, and I repeated, “If you touch me again I will break your nose.” He didn’t grab me again after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0c33&quot; id=&quot;0c33&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Scoble went back to making out with the other inebriated woman before my friend established that she wasn’t able to consent in any way, was married to someone else, and wasn’t able to walk on her own. He interceded. She was propped up between two of my friends, walked away from the scene, and looked after for the evening. Both of those guys will have my undying respect for what they did that night. But that was also on my mind when I started thinking about telling this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;11df&quot; id=&quot;11df&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I checked in with the organizers after that to make sure I would still be invited again if I broke Robert Scoble’s nose for sexually assaulting me. They said sure. But neither me nor they did or said anything more. I can’t be sure why for anyone but me, but I know why I decided to stay silent. I never knew who that woman was, I never had a name, contact information, anything. But I knew she was likely to get uncovered and destroyed if I spoke up. I had protected myself, the way I had for years in the technology scene, by threatening what should have been a professional contact with violence. I realized I was part of the problem that night — a woman’s safety in her career environment shouldn’t require credible threats of violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;167f&quot; id=&quot;167f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I talked to a lot of people after the weekend. Every time the question was raised of what I should do about Scoble assaulting me, I flashed back to another friend, K, who I’d known long before I got into this world. I got to know her when she married a friend of mine. She was a warmhearted and energetic person. But after one fateful party, she told her new husband that she was sexually assaulted. He threw her assaulter off a mailing list we were all on, and then quit as the list administrator. It blew up into a local scandal, and people demanded to know who the victim was. We tried to hide her identity, but her name got posted to the list. Once she was outed as a victim, the hate mail, the barrage of nasty questions, the endless accusations took, such a toll on her. Eventually, she took her own life. She’d just never been able to put it all back together after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c607&quot; id=&quot;c607&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;A few weeks after I met Scoble at Foo Camp I met up with a friend in San Francisco who also knew him. He introduced me to one of Scoble’s female co-workers. She agreed with angry enthusiasm about Scoble’s behavior. Harassment was just part of working with him, it was commonly known, one of our “Open Secrets” in the tech world. But again, I couldn’t come forward and name her for risk of destroying her career and possibly personal life. So, despite being in the best position a woman could hope for, despite having an ironclad reputation and pretty damn good at opsec, I’ve stayed silent. I couldn’t risk the other women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;45fc&quot; id=&quot;45fc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For years when I saw Scoble’s name on something, or the mention of Rackspace, his employer, I flinched. I stopped consuming media that was supported by Rackspace, not wanting to feel those hands on me every time they were mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b000&quot; id=&quot;b000&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It’s been a long time now. With any luck, those other women will be hard to find if they want to be. Scoble has &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@scobleizer/danny-bittman-thank-you-b9169da81239&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@scobleizer/danny-bittman-thank-you-b9169da81239&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gotten sober and written apologetically&lt;/a&gt; about doing bad things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3abb&quot; id=&quot;3abb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’m very mixed on this. I believe if we don’t provide paths of redemption for badly behaved people, we enable abusers as much as we do by remaining silent. I also believe we need to talk about these things plainly, and we need to seek to help and elevate the victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a136&quot; id=&quot;a136&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I learned when I was raped as a teenager that the complete demonization of the rapist is counterproductive. My rapist was my high school boyfriend, considered a better student and a boy with much better prospects than me. It was occasionally suggested that I’d be lucky to be raped by a boy of his stature, always with encouragement that I let the whole thing go. I never did. It was never said, but it was implied that I was trying to ruin a person whose life was, simply put, worth more than mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f53f&quot; id=&quot;f53f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What we both were was fucked teenagers who needed help, and one had hurt the other. Not strange, not rare. Instead of addressing that, I was pushed out of school, and his emotional problems were ignored and neglected. In the end, my rapist and I were better allies to each other than our schools and families were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0f3b&quot; id=&quot;0f3b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The demonization of either rapists or victims is what makes the subject unapproachable, and doesn’t let anyone intercede to get abusive people the help they need, much less the victims. Men aren’t wild predators, but sometimes the broken ones can do very bad things. Sometimes, even if rarely, broken women do bad things to men. So the people who care for, love, or need these broken people cover for them. They destroy the people that seem the most likely to destroy their loved ones: the victims. Ultimately, this neglect destroys their loved ones, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ded8&quot; id=&quot;ded8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’ve watched this toxic dynamic play out in my life and others since I was a child. This is the first reason I became a fan of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;restorative justice&lt;/a&gt;. Not because I am some kind of soft-on-crime libtard, but because I’d rather less people got assaulted and raped in the future, and restorative justice prevents more terrible things from happening. But restorative justice is hard, for everyone, not just the aggressor and victim. It requires admitting and discussing painful issues, and looking for ways to make things whole, by the community, not just the people directly involved. This has to happen even when things can never be whole again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;96b3&quot; id=&quot;96b3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;I do hope Robert Scoble gets the help he needs, and I hope that the women he hurt get the help they (we) need. And I hope that Scoble and the people who helped Scoble perpetrate this violence against the women around him spend their time lifting up the careers of these women, as some small recompense for what they endured in their workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., October 19, 2017 — &lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-39683&quot; src=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/intel-me-neutdis-300x200.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; srcset=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/intel-me-neutdis-300x200.png 300w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/intel-me-neutdis-768x512.png 768w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/intel-me-neutdis-1024x683.png 1024w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/intel-me-neutdis.png 1293w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot;/&gt;Purism’s Librem Laptops, running &lt;a href=&quot;https://coreboot.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;coreboot&lt;/a&gt;, are now available with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://puri.sm/learn/intel-me/&quot;&gt;Intel Management Engine&lt;/a&gt; completely and verifiably &lt;a href=&quot;https://puri.sm/posts/deep-dive-into-intel-me-disablement&quot;&gt;disabled&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Disabling the Management Engine, long believed to be impossible, is now possible and available in all current Librem laptops, it is also available as a software update for previously shipped recent Librem laptops.” says Todd Weaver, Founder &amp;amp; CEO of Purism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Management Engine (ME), part of Intel AMT, is a separate CPU that can run and control a computer even when powered off. The ME has been the bane of the security market since 2008 on all Intel based CPUs, with publicly released exploits against it, is now disabled by default on all Purism Librem laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disabling the Management Engine is no easy task, and it has taken security researchers years to find a way to properly and verifiably disable it. Purism, because it runs coreboot and maintains its own BIOS firmware update process has been able to release and ship coreboot that disables the Management Engine from running, directly halting the ME CPU without the ability of recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Purism Librem laptops were already the most secure current Intel based computers available on the market today, but disabling the management engine solidifies that statement clearly.” says Zlatan Todoric, CTO of Purism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Librem 13 and Librem 15 &lt;a href=&quot;https://puri.sm/products/&quot;&gt;products&lt;/a&gt; can be purchased today and will arrive with the Management Engine disabled by default, and it can be verified to be disabled with the source code released to confirm the disablement is accurate. Showing “ME: FW Partition Table : BAD; ME: Bringup Loader Failure : YES”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Purism, in the long-term pursuit of liberating hardware at the lowest levels, still has more work to do. Removing the management engine entirely is the next step beyond just disabling it. Coreboot also includes another binary, the Intel FSP, a less worrisome but still important binary to liberate, incorporating a free vBIOS is another step Purism plans to take. The road to a completely free system on current Intel CPUs is not over, but the largest step of disabling the Management Engine is arguably the largest milestone to cross.” says Youness Alaoui, Hardware Enablement Developer at Purism.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Training exercise boosts brain power, Johns Hopkins researchers say</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;byline force&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;visuallyhidden&quot;&gt;By&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Jill Rosen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;sep&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;visuallyhidden&quot;&gt;Published&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;publish-date convert-pubdate&quot; data-timestamp=&quot;1508257620&quot;&gt;Oct 20, 2017&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the two brain-training methods most scientists use in research is significantly better in improving memory and attention, Johns Hopkins University researchers found. It also results in more significant changes in brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this exercise didn't make anyone smarter, it greatly improved skills people need to excel at school and at work. These results, &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41465-017-0044-1&quot;&gt;published this week by the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Cognitive Enhancement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, suggest it's possible to train the brain like other body parts—with targeted workouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pullquote inline align-left&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;&quot;People say cognitive training either works or doesn't work. We showed that it matters what kind of training you're doing.&quot;
&lt;p&gt;Kara J. Black&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former JHU post-doctoral fellow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;People say cognitive training either works or doesn't work. We showed that it matters what kind of training you're doing,&quot; said lead author &lt;a href=&quot;http://scienceoflearning.jhu.edu/about-us/our-experts/kara-blacker&quot;&gt;Kara J. Blacker&lt;/a&gt;, a former Johns Hopkins post-doctoral fellow in psychological and brain sciences. &quot;This one task seems to show the most consistent results and the most impact on performance and should be the one we focus on if we're interested in improving cognition through training.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists trying to determine if brain exercises make people smarter have had mixed results. Johns Hopkins researchers suspected the problem wasn't the idea of brain training, but the type of exercise researchers chose to test it. They decided to compare directly the leading types of exercises and measure people's brain activity before and after training; that had never been attempted before, according to Blacker, now a researcher at the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for Advancement of Military Medicine, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the team assembled three groups of participants, all young adults. Everyone took an initial battery of cognitive tests to determine baseline working memory, attention, and intelligence. Everyone also got an electroencephalogram, or EEG, to measure brain activity. Then, everyone was sent home to practice a computer task for a month. One group used one leading brain exercise while the second group used the other. The third group practiced on a control task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The training programs Johns Hopkins compared are not the commercial products sold to consumers, but tools scientists rely on to test the brain's working memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image inline align-left image-landscape column&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://api.hub.jhu.edu/factory/sites/default/files/styles/hub_medium/public/brain_train101717.jpg?itok=oelCYIuM&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone trained five days a week for 30 minutes, then returned to the lab for another round of tests to see if anything about their brain or cognitive abilities had changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the group that practiced what's known as a &quot;dual n-back&quot; exercise showed a 30 percent improvement in their working memory. That was nearly double the gains made by the group working with the other common task, known as &quot;complex span.&quot; The dual n-back group also showed significant changes in brain activity in the prefrontal cortex, the critical region responsible for higher learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dual n-back is a memory sequence test in which people must remember a constantly updating sequence of visual and auditory stimuli. The Johns Hopkins participants saw squares flashing on a grid while hearing letters. They had to remember if the square they just saw and the letter they heard were both the same as one round back. As the test got harder, they had to recall squares and letters two, three, and four rounds back. It's similar to the children's electronic game Simon, but instead of just recalling sounds and colors, participants have to remember the current sequence and the one a few rounds back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other test, called complex span, also involves remembering items in a sequence. There's a distraction for people between items, but they don't need to continually update the items in their mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings demonstrate that the dual n-back is a better regimen to train working memory, which is what people rely on to temporarily hold details in their mind like phone numbers and directions. These skills are vital to how people perform in school and at work, when tasks are new and you can't just rely on old knowledge and habits, says co-author &lt;a href=&quot;http://pbs.jhu.edu/directory/susan-courtney/&quot;&gt;Susan Courtney&lt;/a&gt;, a Johns Hopkins neuroscientist and professor of psychological and brain sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The findings suggest that this particular task is changing something about the brain,&quot; Courtney said. &quot;There's something about sequencing and updating that really taps into the things that only the pre-frontal cortex can do, the real-world problem-solving tasks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step, the researchers say, is to figure out why dual n-back is so good at improving working memory, then figure out how to make it even more effective so that it can become a marketable, or even clinically useful, brain training program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The biggest lesson here was that—yes—intensive training strengthens cognition and the brain, but we still don't understand why and how,&quot; Courtney said. &quot;We can't just jump onto a video game and expect that's going to cure all of our cognitive problems. We need more targeted interventions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Ewen&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist with Johns Hopkins and the Kennedy Krieger Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

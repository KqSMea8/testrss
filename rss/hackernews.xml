<title>Why Skylake CPUs Are Sometimes 50% Slower</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;I got a call that on newer hardware some performance regression tests have become slower. Not a big deal. Usually it is a bad configuration somewhere in Windows or some BIOS settings were set to non optimal values. But this time we were not able to find a setting that did bring performance back to normal. Since the change was not small 9s vs 19s (blue is old hardware orange is new hardware) we needed to drill deeper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aloiskraus.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/image.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;image&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://aloiskraus.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/image_thumb.png?w=274&amp;amp;h=442&quot; width=&quot;274&quot; height=&quot;442&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Same OS, Same Hardware, Different CPU – 2 Times Slower&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A perf drop from 9,1s to 19,6s is definitely significant. We did more checks if the software version under test, Windows, BIOS settings were somehow different from the old baseline hardware. But nope everything was identical. The only difference was that the same tests were running on different CPUs. Below is a picture of the newest CPU&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aloiskraus.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/image1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;image&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://aloiskraus.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/image_thumb1.png?w=433&amp;amp;h=462&quot; width=&quot;433&quot; height=&quot;462&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is the one used for comparison&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aloiskraus.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/image2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;image&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://aloiskraus.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/image_thumb2.png?w=429&amp;amp;h=429&quot; width=&quot;429&quot; height=&quot;429&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Xeon Gold runs on a different CPU Architecture named Skylake which is common to all CPUs produced by Intel since mid 2017. If you are buying current hardware you will get a CPU with Skylake CPU architecture. These are nice machines but as the tests have shown newer and slower is not the right direction. If all else fails get a repro and use a real profiler ™ to drill deeper. When you record the same test on the old hardware and on the new hardware it should quickly lead to somewhere:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aloiskraus.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/image3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;image&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://aloiskraus.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/image_thumb3.png?w=1189&amp;amp;h=818&quot; width=&quot;1189&quot; height=&quot;818&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the diff view in WPA shows in the table the delta of Trace 2 (11s) – Trace 1 (19s). Hence a negative delta in the table indicates a CPU consumption increase of the slower test. When we look at the biggest CPU consumer differences we find &lt;em&gt;AwareLock::Contention&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;JIT_MonEnterWorker_InlineGetThread_GetThread_PatchLabel&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ThreadNative.SpinWait&lt;/em&gt;. Everything points towards CPU spinning when threads are competing for locks. But that is a false red herring because spinning is not the root cause of slower performance. Increased lock contention means that something in our software did become slower while holding a lock which as a consequence results in more CPU spinning. I was checking locking times and other key metrics, like disk and alike but I failed to find anything relevant which could explain the performance degradation. Although not logical I turned back to the increased CPU consumption in various methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find where exactly the CPU was stuck would be interesting. WPA has file and line columns but these work only with private symbols which we do not have because it is .NET Framework code. The next best thing is to get the address of the dll where the instruction is located which is called Image RVA. When I load the same dll into the debugger and then do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;u xxx.dll+ImageRVA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then I should see the instruction which was burning most CPU cycles which was basically only one hot address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aloiskraus.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/image4.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;image&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://aloiskraus.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/image_thumb4.png?w=823&amp;amp;h=328&quot; width=&quot;823&quot; height=&quot;328&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets examine the hot code locations of the different methods with Windbg:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;csharpcode&quot;&gt;
0:000&amp;gt; u clr.dll+0x195&lt;span&gt;66B&lt;/span&gt;-10
clr!AwareLock::Contention+0x135:
00007ff8`0535565b f00f4cc6        &lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;lock&lt;/span&gt; cmovl eax,esi
00007ff8`0535565f 2bf0            sub     esi,eax
00007ff8`05355661 eb01            jmp     clr!AwareLock::Contention+0x13f (00007ff8`05355664)
00007ff8`05355663 cc              &lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;     3
00007ff8`05355664 83e801          sub     eax,1
00007ff8`05355667 7405            je      clr!AwareLock::Contention+0x144 (00007ff8`0535566e)
00007ff8`05355669 f390            &lt;span&gt;pause&lt;/span&gt;
00007ff8`05355&lt;span&gt;66b&lt;/span&gt; ebf7            jmp     clr!AwareLock::Contention+0x13f (00007ff8`05355664)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do this for the JIT method as well&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;csharpcode&quot;&gt;
0:000&amp;gt; u clr.dll+0x&lt;span&gt;2801&lt;/span&gt;-10
clr!JIT_MonEnterWorker_InlineGetThread_GetThread_PatchLabel+0x124:
00007ff8`051c27f1 5e              pop     rsi
00007ff8`051c27f2 c3              ret
00007ff8`051c27f3 833d0679930001  cmp     dword ptr [clr!g_SystemInfo+0x20 (00007ff8`05afa100)],1
00007ff8`051c27fa 7e1b            jle     clr!JIT_MonEnterWorker_InlineGetThread_GetThread_PatchLabel+0x14a (00007ff8`051c2817)
00007ff8`051c27fc 418bc2          mov     eax,r10d
00007ff8`051c27ff f390            &lt;span&gt;pause&lt;/span&gt;
00007ff8`051c&lt;span&gt;2801&lt;/span&gt; 83e801          sub     eax,1
00007ff8`051c2804 75f9            jne     clr!JIT_MonEnterWorker_InlineGetThread_GetThread_PatchLabel+0x132 (00007ff8`051c27ff)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have a pattern. One time the hot location is a jump instruction and the other time it is a subtraction. But both hot instructions are preceded by the same common instruction named pause. Different methods execute the same CPU instruction which is for some reason very time consuming. Lets measure the duration of the pause instruction to see if we are on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;If You Document A Problem It It Becomes A Feature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;224&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CPU&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;176&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pause Duration In ns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;224&quot;&gt;Xeon E5 1620v3 3.5GHz&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;176&quot;&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;224&quot;&gt;Xeon(R) Gold 6126 CPU @ 2.60GHz&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;176&quot;&gt;43&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pause on the new Skylake CPUs is an order of magnitude slower. Sure things can get faster and sometimes a bit slower. But over 10 times slower? That sounds more like a bug. A little internet search about the pause instruction leads to the Intel manuals where the Skylake Microarchitecture and the pause instruction are explicitly mentioned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-optimization-manual.pdf&quot;&gt;https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-optimization-manual.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aloiskraus.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/image5.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;image&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://aloiskraus.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/image_thumb5.png?w=732&amp;amp;h=769&quot; width=&quot;732&quot; height=&quot;769&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No this is not a bug, it is a documented feature. There exists even a web page which contains the timings of pretty much all CPU instructions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agner.org/optimize/instruction_tables.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.agner.org/optimize/instruction_tables.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sandy Bridge     11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ivy Bridege         10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Haswell                9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Broadwell            9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SkylakeX             141&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The numbers are CPU cycles. To calculate the actual time you need to divide the cycle counts by the CPU frequency (usually GHz) to get the time in ns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means when I execute heavily multithreaded applications on .NET on latest hardware things can become much slower. Someone else has this noticed already in August 2017 and has written an issue for it:  &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/13388&quot;&gt;https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/13388&lt;/a&gt;. The issue has been fixed with .NET Core 2.1 and .NET Framework 4.8 Preview contains also the fixes for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet-framework-early-access/blob/master/release-notes/build-3621/dotnet-build-3621-changes.md#clr&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet-framework-early-access/blob/master/release-notes/build-3621/dotnet-build-3621-changes.md#clr&quot;&gt;https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet-framework-early-access/blob/master/release-notes/build-3621/dotnet-build-3621-changes.md#clr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Improved spin-waits in several synchronization primitives to perform better on Intel Skylake and more recent microarchitectures. [495945, mscorlib.dll, Bug]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But since .NET 4.8 is still one year away I have requested a backport of the fixes to get .NET 4.7.2 back to speed on latest hardware. Since many parts of .NET are using spinlocks you should look out for increased CPU consumption around Thread.SpinWait and other spinning methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aloiskraus.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/image6.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;image&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://aloiskraus.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/image_thumb6.png?w=602&amp;amp;h=318&quot; width=&quot;602&quot; height=&quot;318&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E.g. Task.Result will internally Spin internally where I could see for other tests also a significant increase in CPU consumption and degraded performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Bad Is It?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have looked at the .NET Core code how long the CPU will keep spinning when the lock is not released before calling into WaitForSingleObject to pay the “expensive” context switch. A context switch is somewhere in the microsecond region and becomes much slower when many threads are waiting on the same kernel object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.NET Locks multiply the maximum Spin duration with the number of cores which has the fully contended case in mind where every core has a thread waiting for the same lock and tries to spin long enough to give everyone a chance to work a bit before paying for the kernel call. Spinning inside .NET uses an exponential back off algorithm where spinning starts with 50 pause calls in a loop where for each iteration the number of spins is multiplied by 3 until the next spin count becomes greater than the maximum spin duration. I have calculated the total time how long a thread would spin on pre Skylake CPU and current Skylake CPUs for various core numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aloiskraus.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/image7.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;image&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://aloiskraus.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/image_thumb7.png?w=898&amp;amp;h=423&quot; width=&quot;898&quot; height=&quot;423&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is some simplified code how .NET Locks perform spinning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span&gt;/// &amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;/// This is how .NET is spinning during lock contention minus the Lock taking/SwitchToThread/Sleep calls&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;/// &amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;/// &amp;lt;param name=&quot;nCores&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/param&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Spin&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; nCores)
{
        &lt;span&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; dwRepetitions = &lt;span&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;;
        &lt;span&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; dwInitialDuration = &lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;x32;
        &lt;span&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; dwBackOffFactor = &lt;span&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;;
        
        &lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; dwMaximumDuration = &lt;span&gt;20&lt;/span&gt; * &lt;span&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt; * nCores;

        &lt;span&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; i = &lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;; i &amp;lt; dwRepetitions; i++)
        {
                &lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; duration = dwInitialDuration;
                &lt;span&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
                {
                        &lt;span&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; k = &lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;; k &amp;lt; duration; k++)
                        {
                                Call_PAUSE();
                        }
                        duration *= dwBackOffFactor;
                }
                &lt;span&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; (duration &amp;lt; dwMaximumDuration);
        }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old spinning times were in the millisecond region (19ms for 24 cores) which is already quite a lot compared to the always mentioned high costs of context switches which are an order of magnitude faster. But with Skylake CPUs the total CPU Spinning times for a contended lock have exploded and we will spin up to 246ms on a 24 or 48 core machine only because the latency of the new Intel CPUs has increased the pause instruction by a factor 14. Is this really the case? I have created  a small tester to check full CPU spinning and the calculated numbers nicely match my expectations. I have 48 threads waiting on a 24 core machine for a single lock where I call Monitor.PulseAll to let the race begin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aloiskraus.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/image8.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;image&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://aloiskraus.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/image_thumb8.png?w=890&amp;amp;h=531&quot; width=&quot;890&quot; height=&quot;531&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one thread will win the race but 47 threads will spin until the give up. This is experimental evidence that we indeed have a real issue with CPU consumption and very long Spin times are a real issue. Excessive spinning hurts scalability because CPU cycles are burned where other threads might need the CPU, although the usage of the pause instruction frees up some of the shared CPU resources while “sleeping” for longer times. The reason for spinning is to acquire the lock fast without going to the kernel. If that is true the increased CPU consumption might not look good in task manager but it should not influence performance at all as long as there are cores left for other tasks. But what the tests did show that nearly single threaded operations where one thread adds something to a worker queue while the worker thread waits for work and then performs some task with the work item are slowed down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for that can be shown best with a diagram. Spinning for a contended lock happens in steps where the amount of spinning is tripled after each step. After each Spin Round the lock checks again if the current thread can get it. While spinning the lock tries to be fair and switches over to other threads from time to time to help the other thread/s to complete its work. That increases the chances the lock has been released when we check again later. The problem is that only after a complete Spin Round has completed the lock checks if it can be taken:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://aloiskraus.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/image9.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;image&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://aloiskraus.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/image_thumb9.png?w=665&amp;amp;h=251&quot; width=&quot;665&quot; height=&quot;251&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If e.g. during Spin Round 5 the lock becomes signaled right after we did start Round 5 we wait for the complete Spin Round until we can acquire the lock. By calculating the spin duration for the last round we can estimate the worst case of delay that can happen to our thread:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aloiskraus.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/image10.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;image&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://aloiskraus.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/image_thumb10.png?w=934&amp;amp;h=303&quot; width=&quot;934&quot; height=&quot;303&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That are many milliseconds we can wait until spinning has completed. Is that a real issue?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have created a simple test application that implements a producer consumer queue where the worker thread works for each work item 10ms and the consumer has a delay of 1-9 ms before sending in the next work item. That is sufficient to see the effect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aloiskraus.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/image11.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;image&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://aloiskraus.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/image_thumb11.png?w=365&amp;amp;h=169&quot; width=&quot;365&quot; height=&quot;169&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see for some sender thread delays of one and two ms a total duration of 2,2s whereas the other times we are twice as fast with ca. 1,2s. This shows that excessive CPU spinning is not only a cosmetic issue which only hurts heavily multithreaded applications but also simple producer consumer threading which involves only two threads. For the run above the ETW data speaks on its own that the increased CPU spinning is really the cause for the observed delay:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aloiskraus.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/image12.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;image&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://aloiskraus.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/image_thumb12.png?w=841&amp;amp;h=462&quot; width=&quot;841&quot; height=&quot;462&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we zoom into the slow section we find in red the 11ms of spinning although the worker (light blue) has completed its work and has returned the lock a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aloiskraus.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/image13.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;image&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://aloiskraus.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/image_thumb13.png?w=838&amp;amp;h=352&quot; width=&quot;838&quot; height=&quot;352&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fast non degenerate case looks much better where only 1ms is spent spinning for the the lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aloiskraus.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/image14.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;image&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://aloiskraus.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/image_thumb14.png?w=837&amp;amp;h=354&quot; width=&quot;837&quot; height=&quot;354&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test application I did use is named  &lt;em&gt;SkylakeXPause&lt;/em&gt; and located at &lt;a title=&quot;https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhcFq7XO98yJgsMDiyTk6ZEt9pDXGA&quot; href=&quot;https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhcFq7XO98yJgsMDiyTk6ZEt9pDXGA&quot;&gt;https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhcFq7XO98yJgsMDiyTk6ZEt9pDXGA&lt;/a&gt; which contains a zip file with the source code and the binaries for .NET Core and .NET 4.5. What I actually did to compare things was to install on the Skylake machine .NET 4.8 Preview which contains the fixes and .NET Core 2.0 which still implements the old spinning behavior. The application targets .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET 4.5 which produces and exe and a dll. Now I can test the old and new spinning behavior side by side without the need to patch anything which is very convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

        {
                &lt;span&gt;lock&lt;/span&gt; (_LockObject)
                {
                        WorkItems++;
                        Monitor.PulseAll(_LockObject);
                }
                SimulateWork(delayInMs);
        }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a .NET issue. It affects all Spinlock implementations which use the pause instruction. I have done a quick check into the Windows Kernel of Server 2016 but there is no issue like that visible. Looks like Intel was kind enough to give time a hint that some changes in the spinning strategy are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the issue was reported to .NET Core in August 2017 in September 2017 it was already fixed and pushed out with .NET Core 2.0.3 (&lt;a title=&quot;https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/13388&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/13388&quot;&gt;https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/13388&lt;/a&gt;). It is not only that the reaction speed of the .NET Core team is amazing but also that the issue has been fixed on the mono branch a few days ago now as well and discussions about even more Spinning improvements are ongoing. Unfortunately the Desktop .NET Framework is not moving as fast but at least we have with .NET Framework 4.8 Preview at least a proof of concept that the fixes work there as well. Now I am waiting for the backport to .NET 4.7.2 to be able to use .NET at its full speed also on latest hardware. This was my first bug which was directly related to a performance change in one CPU instruction. ETW remains the profiling tool of choice on Windows. If I had a wish I would Microsoft make to port the ETW infrastructure on Linux because the current performance tooling still sucks at Linux. There were some interesting kernel capabilities added recently but an analysis tool like WPA remains yet to be seen there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are running .NET Core 2.0 or desktop .NET Framework on CPUs which were produced since mid 2017 you should definitely check out your application with a profiler if you are running at reduced speed due to this issue and upgrade to the newer .NET Core and hopefully soon .NET Desktop version. My test application can tell you if you could be having issues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;csharpcode&quot;&gt;
D:\SkylakeXPause\bin\Release\netcoreapp2.0&amp;gt;dotnet SkylakeXPause.dll -check
Did call pause 1,000,000 &lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; 3.5990 ms, Processors: 8
No SkylakeX problem detected

or 

D:\SkylakeXPause\SkylakeXPause\bin\Release\net45&amp;gt;SkylakeXPause.exe -check
Did call pause 1,000,000 &lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; 3.6195 ms, Processors: 8
No SkylakeX problem detected
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool will report an issue only if you are running on a not fixed .NET Framework on a Skylake CPU. I hope you did find the issue as fascinating as I did. To really understand an issue you need to create a reproducer which allows you to experiment to find all relevant influencing factors. The rest is just boring work but now I do understand the reasons and consequences of CPU spinning much better.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Tell HN: I miss the old internet</title>
<link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17334552</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17334552</guid>
<description>&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;&lt;td readability=&quot;45&quot;&gt;This is more of a rant I guess. HN provides a text box, that's close enough for me.
&lt;p&gt;I was born in 1988, I'm officially 30. While technically I never got to see the birth of the internet, I remember it differently sometimes. More nostalgically. The summer that never ended. When I was in my adolescent years, I chatted with dozens of people a day. Some I never got to meet in person. Some I did. People from all over the world. Our gateway drugs to the internet were things like IRC, MSN, AOL. Never was a big ICQ person, but I guess that counts. Adium was always on. I don't quite remember how I met these fleeting, ephemeral, personal contacts. Mostly through web rings, PHPbb forums, personal reference. We talked so much, about everything. &quot;how's your day&quot;. &quot;what do you think about Bush&quot;, &quot;hey I saw your del.icio.us link&quot;. Of course that faded, to make place for Twitter and Facebook. And at first, that was great. But it feels different now. So different, that I've removed myself from all social media. &quot;social media&quot;. It's all influencers (a word my dictionary doesn't even recognize), bots, hate speech, bickering, identity politics, and what have you. What happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss those days sometimes. Maybe it's just rose colored glasses of my puberty years. But you know, nothing fundamentally changed about my lifestyle. The internet changed. I'm still self employed, child-free ... what do you call it these days: geek, nerd? you know the slightly overweight guy with a telescope that won't shut up about how great Babylon 5 was. Where do these people hang out these days? If they just want to have a nice chat, unrelated to work, about the stuff that interests them? Seems like a Silly Valley opportunity. But what do I know. I miss the old internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this should just be named &quot;how to make friends in your 30s&quot; instead. It's different world out there, but I miss talking to people I've never met. Learn about their lives, be part of it somehow. And they, part of mine in return. I guess there's no turning back from the bots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

<title>We Should Teach Music History Backwards</title>
<link>https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/why-we-should-teach-music-history-backwards-180955053/?no-ist</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/why-we-should-teach-music-history-backwards-180955053/?no-ist</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The problem with music history is it’s almost always presented in the wrong direction: forward, from the beginning of something to the end. History would be more meaningful if it were taught backwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it: how does one discover and fall in love with the music by the likes of the Black Keys? Is it through first investigating Charley Patton and then working the way through Son House, the Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin and Lynyrd Skynyrd till finally reaching the Ohio-based blues-rock band? Not if you’re under 35, because by the time you began listening to music, the Black Keys were already part of your world. Once hooked, you love them so much that you read every interview to find out who influenced them. That’s how you and other true fans find out about the backwards progression to North Mississippi Allstars, R.L. Burnside, Mississippi Fred McDowell, and then finally back to Charley Patton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fo their part, the Beatles and Rolling Stones sent music lovers scouring for recordings by Buddy Holly, Carl Perkins, Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters in the dusty back bins of the local department store. Holly and Perkins in turn led to Elvis Presley, who led to Bill Monroe and Hank Williams. Berry and Waters led to Howlin’ Wolf, who led to Robert Johnson, and then once again, back to Charley Patton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how we learn about music: backwards, always backwards. We don’t start our investigations at some arbitrarily chosen point in the past; we begin where we are, from our current burning passion. This is the most effective kind of learning, driven by emotion rather than obligation. If learning is best done this way, shouldn’t music history writing and teaching be done in the same backwards direction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obvious problems present themselves. In the history of Western narrative, stories have always been told in the forward direction—with such rare exceptions as playwright Harold Pinter's &lt;em&gt;Betrayal&lt;/em&gt;,  “Seinfeld”’s riff on Pinter, and the noir thriller &lt;em&gt;Memento&lt;/em&gt;, written by Christopher and Jonathan Nolan. Authors want to give us the earliest incident first and the subsequent incidents later, the cause first and then the effect. But when it comes to cultural history, we already know the effect, because we’re living with it. What we’re curious about is the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution to this conundrum is the flashback, a common device in modern fiction. Within each flashback scene, the action and dialogue move forward—even the most sophisticated readers aren’t ready for backwards dialogue. But through the skillful manipulation of such scenes, writers and teachers can lead readers and students backwards through history, reinforcing the audience’s natural inclination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How might this work? Suppose we were teaching a class of high school students about American music. Where would we begin? We might start with the Brit-soul singer Sam Smith singing his signature song, “Stay with Me.” singer with the buttoned-up white shirt, three-piece blue suit and close-cropped hair. When that song, its album, &lt;em&gt;In the Lonely Hour&lt;/em&gt;, and the singer swept four of this year’s biggest Grammy Awards—Best Record, Best Song, Best Pop Vocal Album and Best New Artist—the natural reaction is to ask, “Where did this come from?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;854&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not that Smith is merely copying the past, for he and his producers/co-writers have honed the R&amp;amp;B ballad tradition to a new leanness: the simple drum thump and half-note piano chords allow Smith’s honeyed tenor to remain so conversational that it feels like we’re eavesdropping on his mumbled plea to a departing lover. But Smith is not inventing this sound from scratch either, and the curious young listener is going to want to know what he borrowed. (Curious listeners may be a minority of all listeners, but they’re a significant minority—and it’s for them that music critics write.) Smith is transforming arena-rock anthems by setting their clarion melodies in hymn-like arrangements. With “Stay with Me,” the rock source material (“I Won’t Back Down”) was so obvious that Smith had to share writing credits with Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we critics must lead those listeners backwards through history. We don’t have to go very far to hear Smith confessing his debt to Mary J. Blige. “I remember holding her &lt;em&gt;Breakthrough&lt;/em&gt; album,” Smith confesses in an interview snippet on Blige's newest record, &lt;em&gt;London Sessions.&lt;/em&gt; “Holding it in my hands, in my car, listening to it on repeat. To me she was this untouchable goddess.” Smith repays that debt by co-writing four of the new disc's dozen songs with Blige, including the first single, “Therapy,” an obvious allusion to “Rehab” by another Brit-soul singer, the late Amy Winehouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;854&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blige sounds revitalized on &lt;em&gt;The London Sessions&lt;/em&gt;, as if working with Smith and his British colleagues had returned her to the days of 2005’s &lt;em&gt;The Breakthrough&lt;/em&gt;, when her all her collaborations with rappers such as Ghostface Killah, Nas and Jay-Z allowed her to refashion R&amp;amp;B by replacing maximalist arrangements with minimalist beats and romantic sentiment with streetwise skepticism. But let’s go backwards even further and find out where Blige found her sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If her attitude and backing tracks came out of the hip-hop scene in the Bronx, where she was born, the vibrancy of her big &lt;em&gt;mezzo&lt;/em&gt; was inspired by gospel-soul singers such as Aretha Franklin, Chaka Khan and Anita Baker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blige recorded songs made famous by all three of those role models early in her career, and got her start singing in churches in Georgia and the Yonkers, where she spent her troubled childhood. Like Blige, Franklin was a church soloist and a child-abuse victim, according to &lt;em&gt;Respect&lt;/em&gt;, the new biography by David Ritz. That dramatic combination of deep wounds and yearning for redemption marks both singers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following our historical trail backwards, we find ourselves in 1956 at Detroit's New Bethel Baptist Church, where the 14-year-old Franklin is singing hymns from her new gospel album. She has been touring with her famous preacher father C.L. Franklin and such gospel stars as Sam Cooke, Clara Ward and Inez Andrews, and the teenage prodigy already displays the robust warmth and piercing urgency of those role models. But she also hints at something extra, a cutting edge that comes not from buttery bounty of the “Gospel Queen” Mahalia Jackson but from the guitar-playing gospel renegade: Sister Rosetta Tharpe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we go back even further and find ourselves at New York’s Carnegie Hall on December 23, 1938, as the 23-year-old Tharpe performs in the legendary “From Spirituals to Swing” concert organized by John Hammond, who would later sign Franklin to Columbia Records and produce her early albums. This show introduces white New York audiences to the genius of African-American artists such as Tharpe, Count Basie, Joe Turner, James P. Johnson and Big Bill Broonzy, and kicks off the boogie-woogie craze with appearances by pianists Meade Lux Lewis, Pete Johnson and Albert Ammons. Ammons accompanies Tharpe on her two songs, and she steals the show. When she sings her recent hit, “Rock Me,” the lyrics may be asking God to rock her in the bosom of Abraham, but her voice and guitar are hinting at another kind of rocking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are also hinting at how easily a love song to God can be turned into a love song for a more earthly creature and how that porous boundary will inspire Franklin, Cooke, Blige, Winehouse, Smith and much of the rest of Anglo-American music for the next 77 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we had tried to tell this story forward, we would have lost most of our audience once they encountered Tharpe’s old-fashioned dresses, twangy guitar and sanctified lyrics. But by telling the story backwards, we were able to lead our listeners from their existing enthusiasm for Smith to newfound excitement over Blige and then Franklin. When our reverse historical journey finally reached Tharpe, our fellow travelers were primed to embrace a spectacular talent they may never have bothered with coming from any other direction.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;PART ONE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  An epiphany was had this morning as I perused SA, sipping Code Red and toying with the notion of stepping outside for my third cigarette in an hour: Nine years and 2 months of my life have been devoted towards the goal of personal advancement within a small yet thriving company. I arrived one spring morning at the offices of a local company - just a 15 year old, acne-encrusted, bespectacled face in the crowd - with a dot-matrix printed resume extolling my massive abilities with the 386 computer and willingness to work after school. I was immediately hired at minimum wage and began a series of menial jobs within said company, including authorizing credit cards, and serving as a squeaky-voiced telephone operator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;At 16, I graduated from High School, and moved off to the wonderful world of college. Yet, for the sole reason of tuition re-imbursement, I continued with the same company - continuing to bounce around from department to department, serving as a van driver, a shipping and receiving inspector, an MIS administrator - I never stayed in one place for very long. It was during this time period, the wonderfully blurry undergraduate years, that I unknowingly sowed the seeds of my current employment bliss. The groundwork was laid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Come graduate school, my contributions to said company began to become clear to some in positions of power. I was transferred for the 11th time in 6 years, this time to a place of some responsibility for the everyday running of the company. By day I struggled to comprehend superstring theory, laboring under the false assumption that a Masters Degree in Physics would bring exciting things for me. By night, I climbed the corporate ladder. Supervisorship, Management, power. I had it all at age 21 - a brand new piece of paper designating me a master in the Physical Sciences, and a Management position in a strong company, a score of people twice my age reporting to me. I worked 70 hours a week, but I believed that I had achieved in a short amount of time what it had taken my father 50 years to attain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then came September 11th. As the twin towers fell, the economy fell with it. Faced with massive layoffs, my company was forced to cut my entire department, and leave all responsibilities solely in my hands. I was a Manager with no employees, a General without an Army... yet I still toiled, long and hard. It continued this way for three months - I never slept, I spent every waking minute at the office, yet I convinced myself this was still the greatest thing going - the American Dream. One day, in a morning coffee and donuts meeting, a Vice President suggested the possibility of moving myself and my responsibilities out of the corporate offices, and instead to a satellite facility, some 1,000 miles away. Seeing this as an opportunity for advancement, I jumped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;So I arrived, acquired a large office in a remote corner of said facility, and continued with my march towards greatness. Then, something strange and wonderful happened. In outlook, an EMail appeared with my name in the &quot;Courtesy Copy&quot; field. Apparently, a new Vice President had decided to delegate the responsibilities that once were mine to another department. Immediately frightened for my job and my well being, I was tempted to scream out - yet, thankfully, I remained silent. I continued to come into the office on time every day, picked up the random pieces of my old job that were left scattered in the transition, and waited for the word.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;That, my friends, was 4 months ago to the day. After 30 days, I became convinced that I was a forgotten, non digestible entity in the corporate stomach. No man ever comes over to ask me for anything - although I am but a Manager, and Directors roam the hallways like rabid hyenas, I am much too senior to all of them for them to attempt an attack. Every once in a while, the phone will ring, and an old acquantance will ask for help solving a problem - I gladly comply. Sometimes, I let the phone ring... but the voicemail light never comes on. They move on to the next target, under the false assumption that I am much too busy to be bothered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I started coming in later, wearing blue jeans on Mondays, testing my limits. I take 25 cigarette breaks a day, come back into my air conditioned office, dim the lights, and browse the internet in a half-comatose state until I determine that it is time to pack up for the day. Old copies of Baseball Weekly adorn the mohogany desk, and reams of paper lie in and around the unattended trash bin, each covered with random drawings of stick figures and jet fighters. I often roam the hallways with a piece of paper and a mug of coffee, exchanging pleasantries and talking about the weather and equally mindless topics with my co-workers. I go to meetings, and other managers gaze with reverence at my presence - I am never invited, but to those who know not what I do, I am respected and welcomed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It hit me this morning that perhaps all of my endless toil and hard work has landed me here. I've transferred so much within the company that all paperwork on me has been long since misplaced. I exist only in a computer program that spits out a 4 digit paycheck to my bank account every other thursday - just another tick on the underbelly of the corporate warthog. Too senior to be fired, too misunderstood to be bothered, I am truly the forgotten employee.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;And so, my SA friends, I am quite open to suggestions about how I may truly test the boundaries of my newly discovered freedom. A webcam lays in its box underneath my desk, awaiting my motivation to install it. No suggestion is outside the boundary of reason or consideration - for, I have now found my Holy Grail. I have achieved the American Dream. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-------------------------------&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;PART TWO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;All that I have worked for over the past 5 months of not working nearly came to a horrible death this past Friday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I arrived at the office at 1030 - still dressed in the wrinkled khaki pants from my very lengthy Thursday night at the bar. I sneaked in the side door, and made a B-line for my office. On the way, I was stopped by an electrician, who informed me that they were working on the air conditioning in the office building, and that some sections of the sprawling complex would be without electricity during different parts of the day. He reassured me that if I was, indeed, in an occupied area of the building, that I would be informed in plenty of time. Of course, since nobody knows I exist, I expected to be left in the darkness at some point during the day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I eased into my office, shut the door, and sat down at my desk. My morning regimine consists of checking baseball scores - a quick once over of SA, then off to randomly scour the network drive for Excel documents. I will pull up at least 5 spreadsheets (ranging from actual important pricesheets to recent Company Softball scores - it doesn't matter, as long as it's an Excel Document.) I print them out, then walk to the other side of the office building to copy them. Somehow, in my mind, this makes it look like I'm working - and looks are the most important thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;On my way to the copy machine, I was stopped by a fellow manager - one who actually works. He &quot;reminded&quot; me of an 1100 meeting in the conference room, and I played dumb.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;You had to have gotten the EMail, it was sent to all managers...&quot; he replied, not knowing that I was the forgotten Employee of company X. I tried to wiggle my way out of it, but I was stuck. Begrudgingly, I made my way into the brightly lit conference room - thinking that it couldn't be that bad. After all, it was Friday, there would probably be Krispy Kreme donuts, and I could easily just sit there and not say a word. I was very, very wrong.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bad Sign #1 Nowhere in the room was the distinct aroma of Honey-glazed-goodness. Even the coffee pot was ominously switched off. This is a horribly bad sign in the corporate world - lack of food means that the meeting will be about only business-related issues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bad Sign #2 The normal large conference table is nowhere to be found. In its place is a U-shaped formation of folding tables. U-shaped formation = audience participation = horribly, horribly bad.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bad Sign #3 I reflexively reached over by the door for the inevitable handout - and felt NOTHING. No handout = note taking is mandatory. I begin to have a very sinking feeling about this meeting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bad Sign #4 Standing in front of the stained dry erase board, was the nemesis of all forgotten employees - The Director of People Services - AKA, Human Resources Nazi. I was a Warsaw Jew, face to face with Himmler. She glanced at me as I quickly averted my stare, but I thought that I may have caught a glimmer of recognition in her eyes, and that, my friends, scared the hell out of me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The beer-sweat started rolling off my forehead as I ran through my options. I was about 15 feet inside the doorway, and Himmler had seen me - quick flight was out of the question. I was forced to sit through this meeting, and try to keep my cover. Looking at the U-shaped formation of tables, I decided to sit directly in the middle - contending that if any type of &quot;let's go around the room...&quot; shit went on, she would undoubtedly start from one of the ends. I took my company cell-phone off and set it on the table, then proceeded to sit and wait.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unfortunately, the meeting turned into my worst nightmare. Buzzwords started keying off alarms in my head as they flowed from the mouth of the hideous HR gargoyle. &quot;Teamwork&quot;, &quot;Employee Insight&quot;, &quot;Departmental Budgets&quot;, etc. The meeting was a quarterly Employee idea meeting, where managers would gather and share what work their &quot;Teams&quot; had accomplished, and what they were looking forward to. Considering my team had been fucking contracted on September 11th, and I was currently a free-agent with no intention of signing with anybody - I was worried. And then it happened...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Let's go around the room and say what the general view among your reporting employees is as to the future of &amp;lt;Company X&amp;gt;...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;SHIT. I knew I was fucked, and I needed to get out. My heart skipped a beat as the first ass-kisser on the end started babbling away about how great his employees are, and started calling them off by name. I needed a fire alarm, a stroke, or a meteor strike, and I needed it soon - before I was forced to open my mouth and out myself as a non-working leech to the rest of the world. My eyes searched the room for something to help me out - the fire alarm was too far away, as was the window. The light switch was directly behind me, but that was only as a last resort. I had almost given up hope, when my eyes situated on the table in front of me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;My cell phone. I needed a phone call, and I needed it as soon as possible. Telekenesis failed me for a good two minutes as it came closer and closer to being my turn. Then I realized something amazing - I was wearing my bar pants. The beauty of my bar pants is that they have amazingly deep pockets - and nestled down past the crumpled up one dollar bills, the napkins, the receipts, and the Bud Light bottlecaps, was my saving grace - my wife's cell phone. And listed under the letter &quot;A&quot; in her preprogrammed numbers was my work cell phone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A rush of excitement filled me, and my hand started slowly inching towards my pocket. Because of the angle of my leg, I couldn't reach into my pants without drawing unwanted attention - so I had to make a go at it from the outside. It was only two clicks - one on the down button in the middle to highlight my number, the other on the send button. But timing was crucial, as it came closer to my time to speak. I felt down the outline of the phone... my finger skimming the display screen, and pushed down once on the scroll button, then mashed to it's left to send the call. I believed victory was mine, but unfortunately, the phone on the desk remained silent. 10 seconds passed, 20 seconds, and yet nothing happened - I had obviously highlighted the wrong name to call.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It struck me as mildly humorous that somewhere, one of my wife's friends was answering a call from her cell-phone, blissfully unaware of my epic struggle to free myself from the meeting-from-hell. As soon as it was obvious that I had dialed the wrong number, I moved my thumb back to the right, and punched the end button appoximately ten times, hoping to cancel everything out. The train of talking had reached the person sitting next to me, and the focus of the room was in my general direction. I probably only had one chance to pull it off - and I had to do it discreetly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;With my body turned towards the speaker, my hand creeped down once more. I coughed slightly as a distraction while my fingers made a ninja-flick across the scroll and send keys, then I moved my hands to the table and waited. 5 seconds, 10 seconds went by. The person next to me was finishing up - it was almost my turn... I thought I was completely done for, and then it happened. The cell-phone lit up, and the tell-tale Nokia tone started resonating throughout the room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;All eyes shot to me as I tried my hardest to contain my elation. I grabbed the phone and pushed the answer button. &quot;Ben&quot;, I said authoritatively. My voice echoed through the speaker as the cell phone in my pocket picked up the background noise. &quot;Oh, yes sir, Mr. (NAME OF A COMPANY VICE PRESIDENT AT THE CORPORATE OFFICE), I have that information at my desk, can it wait? Oh, I understand...&quot; I then covered up the phone and said to the HR-Nazi &quot;Do you mind?&quot; She was taken aback, but smiled and nodded - it was all the break I needed. I sprung out of my chair, and headed for the door, pretending like I was talking, nodding absent-mindedly to myself, engaged in a pretend conversation with my pants - but I was temporarially free.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I hurried back to my office, closed the door, and waited. The time was 12 noon, and I was sure that soon, the HR-Nazi would show her face and ask to sit down and chat about what I had missed at the meeting. I browsed the SA forums for the next four hours, every set of footsteps by my door sending me on a frenzy of window minimization. Four o'clock rolled by. Cars began to leave the parking lot. My phone had not rung, my Outlook Inbox was still empty. At five o'clock, the lights went out in my office. I sat in the complete darkness for five minutes, ten minutes. A half hour went by as I sat in a semi-daze, alone, in a dark office... then it hit me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was safe. I was forgotten. All was right with the world. I took out my cell phone, and played a silent, celebratory game of snake. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;PART THREE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I had been dreading this day. In the back of my mind, I knew it was coming. In all my years here, my anniversary date has held as a beacon of hope - the promise of yet another payraise, yet another shining star on the corporate report card that would one day land me a corner office with a view. This year, however, I wished that it would never come. I was sure that my ninth anniversary at this corporate juggernaut would raise sufficient enough flags to bring the Human Resources Ninjas swinging through my office windows, sending the old copies of Baseball Weekly and collected Mountain Dew bottles flying in a maelstrom of broken dreams as they hauled me off to some cubicle to start being a productive member of society.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The EMail was waiting for me as I came in late to work. The return address was a name that I did not recognize - but the all-familiar (HR) printed in bold at the end of it sent a shiver up my spine. I opened it up, and - all at once - a feeling of relief, bewilderment, and hope overcame me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;quote:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Moonshine Employee #412 , our records indicate that you are due for an annual performance review on September 10 . Please report to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;your designated departmental Director none* on none* for your review.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;* As you are a non-supervised / managerial / other employee, please submit a self review, detailing past accomplishments. Self reviews must be submitted no later than September 13 to employeereview@companyname.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Best Regards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;HR Nazi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I re-read the letter twice, trying my hardest to figure out any hidden meanings. The good news was that, from the form letter, it seemed as though they had no idea what I did. The bad news was that neither did I. I had three days to find out, construct some kind of good response, and send it back in a very unthreatening fashion. I actually needed to do work, and the clock was ticking...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, twenty minutes later, I'm sitting in the bar at Applebee's - downing a cold Bud Light and pondering my situation. Solutions including &quot;prolonged vacation&quot;, &quot;botched workplace injury&quot;, and &quot;phone call to HR to ask what I do&quot; were summarially dismissed, and I had hit a dead-end. I finished off another beer, and the thought suddenly hit me. Every two weeks, without fail, I had recieved a paycheck at my house. Although I had rarely opened them, I knew there was a section on there that listed a departmental code - a simple four digit number that would hold the answer to what my company thought I did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I paid my bill and headed home, determined to wake up in the morning and figure out what I was going to do with myself. Unfortunately, when I got home and opened up an old paycheck, I realized that my department code was listed as 0000, which I feared was a default code - I couldn't have been more wrong.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I showed up at 0900 on September 11th, marking my first return to actual working hours in months. My first stop was to the accounting section of the building - where I cornered a temp employee and asked (real managerial-like), &quot;What department does code 0000 refer to?&quot;. She typed a few numbers into her computer, and replied with something that blew me away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Workplace Safety.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I staggered back a bit, but tried to regain my composure quickly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;How many employee entries are there in the Workplace Safety group?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;She typed two more entries, and came back with &quot;Moonshine, here in Detroit, and James Alexander, in the Fort Worth office.&quot; It was obvious she had no idea who I was, which was a bonus. But my heart sank for a minute as I realized there actually was somebody else in this company who was actually doing the non-job that I was somewhat tasked to do. I retreated to my office and tried to plan my next move. &quot;Workplace Safety?&quot; I thought, trying to take in the gist of what was said to me... was it then my job to make sure that nobody walked around on stilts or ran with scissors while on company property? Not that it was a huge epidemic around here, but I was somewhat freaked that the next time Lumpy McBumperfuck in Shipping and Receiving decided to pour lye on his groin, I would be responsible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The only answer was to find James Alexander. I would pretend that I was actually a working Safety Inspector, and try and pry him about what kind of work he did. I was able to track down the number to the Fort Worth office - and gave him a call...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;James Alexander&quot; was the reply...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Mr Alexander, this is Moonshine, the Detroit Safety Inspector. I was wondering if you could help me with a couple of items that I've got going on up here...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;There was a pregnant pause, then a quick &quot;hold on...&quot;, as I was put on hold. About twenty seconds passed by, then he came back on the line, his voice down at a whisper... &quot;Who do you work for?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I thought quickly... &quot;Greg McDonnell&quot; I lied. I've never even heard of a Greg McDonnell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;And he told you to call me?&quot; Alexander asked, sounding somewhat worried.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;No, sir. I did it of my own volition.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yet another pause, then... &quot;Are you really a workplace safety employee?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I recognized something in his voice, and decided to take a shot. I knew I was putting everything on the line - but it felt as though I was at that point regardless of whether or not I admitted my status to this stranger on the phone. I took a deep breath, and answered a very confident...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;No...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Are you with HR?&quot; was the stern reply.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;No...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Then what do you do?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Nothing...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;There was yet another pause, and a flash of heat cascaded over my skin. There was a barely intelligible snort, almost laughter, then he replied...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Me neither...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was like I had asked him if he had stairs in his house, only the answer was one hundred times more exciting. It turns out James Alexander of Fort Worth Texas was an original Workplace Safety Inspector, and had been with the company for 7 years. About three years ago, the department was dissolved and the responsibility for oversight was placed in the hands of our company's Quality Control department back down in Florida. He was furloughed for a period of 5 months, then one day he received a letter asking him to return to work. When he returned, he was given temporary quarters in a recently abandoned office, and was told that he would be given new assignments shortly. Shortly turned into two years...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was amazed that I was not the only one who was forgotten in this corporation. He told me that all he did all day was browse the internet, and replace the contents of the First Aid kit when they ran low. He had never failed to recieve a raise, and was never once accosted by any higher- ups. He and I postulated that the computer must have defaulted to a 0000 code when none was inputted for my employee file - luckily, here 0000 wasn't just a code meaning &quot;nothing&quot;, it was actually still the defunct Workplace Safety group. He told me to count my blessings, and hung up the phone with a sincere &quot;Good luck...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The next day, I showed up at work with a new purpose in life. What I had come across was even better than having no job - I now have a job with no responsibilities. I walked throughout the office, looking at light sockets, chairs, and microwaves - exactly as I supposed that a &quot;Safety Inspector&quot; would do. Later that day, I would write my personal review, remembering to keep it vague and short, so as not to rouse attention. James had informed me that most reviews would be automatically answered with a standard raise, without ever crossing the desk of anybody except an HR secretary - just so long as you don't admit to doing anything extrordinarially good or bad. So I wrote...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;quote:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;EMPLOYEE: Moonshine #412&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ACCOMPLISHMENTS: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-Maintained a zero accident rate in the Detroit corporate and shipping offices for the entire 2002 calendar year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-Responded to every safety issue in a timely fashion. This internal customer service was accomplished within the allotted budget.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-Heightened awareness for safety related issues among employees.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I hit send, and waited for the possible downfall the next week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This past Wednesday, I showed up at work with a bottle of UNASPIRIN from 7-11, and a rubber carpet bumper that I picked up at Home Depot. Back where the employees go out to smoke, the carpet at the door was horribly mangled, and many an unhappy soul was sent crashing to the floor by a misplaced step on the hazard. So, the first thing I did was put the bumper down, and glued it into place using some bullshit Billy Mays fabric crap glue that the yay-hoo at Home Depot said worked wonders. It wasn't pretty, but now there is no danger of tripping... I am responding to workplace safety issues, keeping under budget (as the 9 dollars came out of my pocket.) I placed a sign on the wall next to the bumper, seen below.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I placed the UNASPIRIN in the breakroom First Aid kit, and proceded to my office. There was a piece of Company Mail sitting on my desk, right next to the OSHA posters that I had ordered - as I assumed that any Safety Inspector's office needed decoration including &quot;A Guide To Hazardous Material&quot;, and &quot;Eye Wash Station Directions&quot;. I sat down in my seat, opened the forums, then slowly opened the letter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;quote:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Moonshine Employee #412&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are pleased to announce that your annual performance review has been deemed satisfactory As a result, your pay rate has been increased by five percent (.05%) retroactive to September 1, 2002&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;HR Nazi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, a week has passed, and nothing else has happened. I was asked to check a battery in a smoke detector by a secretary yesterday - who had unfortunately seen me place the bumper in the back hallway. So, yes, I now have to do some work. But until the Camel Spiders invade Accounting and I've got fatalities on my hands, I will continue to sit here, playing Snake on my Nokia and browsing the Something Awful Forums. I am Moonshine, the protector of Detroit Corporate / Shipping and Receiving - here to make sure NOBODY falls down on my watch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;PART FOUR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;They’re ON TO US”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those four words, ambiguous in meaning, was what greeted me as I opened up Microsoft Outlook one fateful Friday morning. My heart began racing, as I realized that the message had come from none other than James Alexander, my counterpart in Texas. Anybody being &quot;on&quot; to our scheme of hiding under the radar scopes was undoubtedly trouble, trouble that would manifest itself in the very next Email that I opened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s never a good sign when the name in the &quot;From&quot; field is followed by an identifier in brackets... and, as I would learn, it was even worse when that identifier was &quot;RECRUITER&quot;. I double clicked on the message, plainly entitled &quot;Question&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;FROM: Nosy McInmybidness [Recruiter]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;TO: Moonshine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Subj: Question&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hi, Moonshine. My name is Nosy and I’m currently doing a budgetary survey of the Detroit operation. Unfortunately, some of the paperwork for you seems to have been misplaced. I can’t seem to place you anywhere on the company organizational chart. Might you stop by when you have a minute so that we can sort everything out?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A flush of heat swept over me, as well as a slight nervous jitter that would only be calmed by the massive ingestion of nicotine into my nervous body. With trembling hands, I lit up a cigarette right at my desk, and sat back to ponder what my move was. A multitude of discovery scenarios had played out in my head in the months leading to this unexpected twist, but they all involved the temporary stream of bullshit that would spray from my mouth should somebody ever, in passing, ask what it was exactly that I did. Nothing had prepared me for a meeting. Therefore I decided on the smartest possible thing to do - ignore it like that lump on my balls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I quickly deleted the Email, logged onto the SA Forums, and tried to clear my mind. It seemed to work for a few hours, as I was lost in complete bliss... then that goddamn box popped up. The temptation to click &quot;No, I do not want to read this new mail that has been sent to me by somebody that is most likely hell bent on my demise&quot; was overcome by curiosity, and my thumb subconsciously flecked the enter button to display what was surely another Email from Ms. Nosy. My worst nightmares were confirmed by the subject line: &quot;RE: Not Read: Question&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The bitch had read receipts enabled. Those all so sneaky checkmarks that for years have exposed management to the sheer number of &quot;Must Read Notices&quot; that go promptly into employee’s deleted items folder had once again surfaced to bite me in the pale white ass. The body of the message was even more ominous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;I see that you are in. I will come down to your office to discuss. West side, first floor, correct?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The irrational side of my brain begged me to supply her with fake directions. I rationalized the thought, believing that it would indeed buy me time - but realizing that it would only dig the hole deeper. I assessed my options for escape. And yes, tactically my mind works as a cross between BF1942 and MSPaint...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was without sufficient weaponry to meet her head on, and she was coming towards me from one of my only two possible exit routes. The only other escape route was down the hallway, and out to my car. Unfortunately, I was unaware of how much time I had left, or if she was hanging outside my closed door right now. It seemed an awfully big risk, to hightail it down that dark corridor, past the rows of unoccupied, locked offices, and off to freedom.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was going to be close. I needed to get to my door, down 60 feet of hallway, and out the side entrance before she rounded the corner. I knew that, as a man, I needed to face adversity in my life - it was either do or die. This was a test of courage and manhood, and there was no backing out. I just had to shuffle quietly thirty feet down the hallway, and off to freedom - with the strong possibility of being caught in the act. It was truly a character defining moment as I stood with my hand trembling on the doorknob, not sure if the Recruiter was standing on the other side. This was a defining moment...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, like a jittery little adolescent squirrel, I scrambled to the other side of my office, and went right out the fucking window. No qualms about it, without even thinking twice, I slid the frosted pane up, and climbed on through. Unfortunately, I neglected my considerable body mass, and fell directly on my ass as I slithered through the cold metal frame.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shaken, but safe, I crouched low to move away from my window, then glanced around to make sure that I hadn’t been seen. Safe in my secrecy, I walked around to the other end of the building, and got in my truck. Tearing out of that parking lot at the speed of light, my only thought was to get as far away from that place as possible - and deal with what may come on Monday morning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, six hours later, I’m at the bar, stirring over a rapidly warming beer (I didn‘t have much taste for alcohol that afternoon), and pondering my problems. I had used the pay phone to call my wife to let her know I would be home late (as I had forgotten my cell phone back in the office, and needed to return for it). I had absolutely nothing in mind of how to counteract this situation - I had figured that perhaps I needed to start making phone calls to Vice Presidents down at the corporate offices, doing damage control, and trying to rebuild what was left of my sidetracked career. I had resolved to do that on Saturday, but first I needed to get back to the office and get my cell phone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The parking lot was lit dimly by the orange glow of the low powered streetlights as I pulled back into the office building. I casually walked up to the front door, sliding my keycard through, and strolled into the office. I expected that nobody was there, and walked with the calm determination that expectation brought.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Oh, shit... ummm...&quot; came a voice from my left. My heart leapt into my throat as I turned to look.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sitting there, in the corner office, was &quot;Paul&quot; our Vice President of Marketing Strategy. Burning the midnight oil, it seemed... with a bottle of Boone’s farm wine, an opened jar of Vaseline, and a box of tissues sitting in plain view on his desk. His left hand worked fervently at the mouse button, in a desperate attempt to close down whatever had previously graced his screen. His bald head grew red as he struggled to keep up with the pop ups - a cascade of hot pink letters proclaiming &quot;HOT TEEN BI-SLUTS&quot; and &quot;ANAL ORIENTAL CUM BITCHES&quot; leaving a virtual blood trail that betrayed his rapid attempts to conceal what he had been looking at.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Mr Moonshine,&quot; he started, his voice cracking. &quot;I didn’t think that anybody was still here...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;No problem, sir… I was just coming back in to...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;No, I really didn’t know. Honest. I, um… I don’t get the AOL at home.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was getting set to walk away, but I stopped, looking over at the slightly overweight man, beads of sweat forming on his forehead. &quot;I’m sorry?&quot; I asked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;I don’t get the web thing at my house. I was just looking at pictures. You know, adult pictures.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I nodded and averted my eyes, but he continued.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot; It just sucks since my wife left me...&quot; I looked back up, incredulous that this man, who up until today I had only met in passing, was doing anything but closing his door and trying to forget the incident.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;I’m sorry,&quot; I repeated again. And that’s when the blubbering began. &quot;I don’t know what to do, its been six months. I’ve never even dated before… for God’s sake look at me.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Uh…&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;See, you can tell. I was married for eighteen years, I have no idea what to do. I can’t even cook noodles. Aw, hell, I have no idea what to do. I tried to do the whole single scene thing, but I’m a fish out of water if there ever was one...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;It takes some time...&quot; I tried to console him cautiously. He motioned me into his office, trying to force a smile. Against my better judgement, I walked in and sat down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;You, you’re a popular guy, right? With the ladies?&quot; he asked. I raised my left hand in response, showing him the wedding ring. He nodded, then looked up to the ceiling, as if searching for what to say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;But you’re used to the partying scene? You can do the whole hippy-hop music stuff, right?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I nodded slowly, unsure of where this was going. &quot;Hip hop...&quot; I corrected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;He smiled as if I had just unlocked a great secret for him... &quot;I tried all that stuff, I’ve been to the nightclubs. I’m just doing something wrong.&quot; Said the overweight, balding Vice President who I had caught masturbating and drinking what most 14 year-old girls have grown out of, right in his office.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot; I want to be able to go out and talk to women. I want to go out and drink beers and dance and have casual relationships, is that an unreasonable request?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;I guess not...&quot; I squirmed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Can you help me?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;My mind raced. I had no idea what he was asking me to do, but then suddenly something clicked in my head. I could turn this thing to my advantage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;This... stuff tonight,&quot; I started, pointing at the computer, &quot;this is all our secret, right?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;He looked shocked, &quot;Of course... why?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;I’ll help you out. But you have to help me out. Have you ever heard of Nosy McInmybidness?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Yes, she’s up from corporate auditing the facilites.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Well, she’s all over me. You know I’ve been here for a while, you know I’m a good employee. How about you just tell her that I’m on your budget, in your department. That way she’ll get off of my case...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;He raised an eyebrow, smiling with the corner of his mouth, &quot;That may be possible. And if I do?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;If you do, I’ll help you get ‘back on your feet’, as far as the social life.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;He reached his hand across the table, and said &quot;Deal.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I looked down at his hand, then back up at him, grimacing mildly... he quickly withdrew it, replying &quot;Oh, yeah. Right.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I got up to walk out of the room, then looked back at him. I smiled for a second. &quot;MILFhunter dot com, sir. Username is xxx, password is xxx. Knock yourself out.&quot; With that, I walked out of his office, and back into the world of feeling secure with my job.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Come Monday morning, and on all the glorious mornings thereafter, I never again heard another word from the &quot;Recruiter&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;EPILOGUE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was inevitable. I had been saved by a Vice President who played with himself in his rich Corinthian leather chair at work, I had to hold up my end of the bargain. And I did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;About two weeks after the episode that still haunts my dreams, I convinced the wife and a few of her work friends to join me and Vice President &quot;Midlife crisis&quot; at the bar. The night began poorly, and went downhill from there. When we first walked in, I spotted him, sitting at a corner booth, tearing the label off a bottle of beer. We went over and sat down, and he perked right up - he was a talkative little bastard, I ended up learning his entire life story - except when a female walked by - at which point he would clam up like a four year old boy. I knew that it would be a difficult situation - especially after two hours and about 5 more beers when he handed me a napkin and asked me to &quot;give it to that sugar bunny of a waitress.&quot; I nodded and stood up, looking down at the wadded up paper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;You are a very beautiful woman. What time do you get off of work? Wave at me if interested.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I resolved about two words into the note that I couldn’t give it to anybody... so I walked to the waitress, and pretended like I was talking to her at the crowded bar, which seemed to satisfy Paul. As I was doing this, my wife came up to me and gave me the equivalent of &quot;We’ve got to go...&quot;, so I had to think quickly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Hey, how does Sandy like Paul?&quot; I asked her. Sandy was a co-worker of my wife, moderately attractive, if you like the ’bleached blonde 80’s pop star who got run over by a tractor’ look.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;She eyed me curiously... &quot;Why?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Have her come over here...&quot; I said. My wife waved her over to the bar, and she stumbled half drunkenly towards us. I explained to her that Paul was really lonely, and was only looking for a friend to pay some attention to him for the night. I also mentioned that he was horribly rich (an assumption), and that he was really a fun guy to be around (a lie). She seemed disinterested at the beginning, but then she took a different approach.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;What’s in it for me?&quot; she asked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;What, like money?&quot; I replied. Nothing in my life had ever prepared me for pimping, so I was kind of rusty when thrown directly into the situation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;I want one of your puppies...&quot; she stated matter-of-factly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I glanced at my wife, who shrugged. A week prior, our hounddog had had a massive litter of pups, and we were having some trouble finding buyers for all of them. Now, Sandy was a nice woman, with kids, but very poor... I didn’t see the harm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Um, okay.&quot; She smiled, then pointed at me, her finger waving drunkenly in my face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;No sex..&quot; she stated, then proceeded to turn around and walk towards our booth, sliding into the seat next to Paul. My wife and I ended up paying our tab, then sliding out of there for the evening, all the while wondering what the heck was going to happen. The suspense was with us all weekend, until I returned to work the following Monday morning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first message on my Inbox was from Paul. It stated simply &quot;Your wife’s friend has GREAT hands.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I sat back, smiling. A puppy for a hand job, and the preservation of the American Dream.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;All in all, a wonderful trade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;PART FIVE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Hey, do you work here?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;What a loaded question, I thought with a pause. Now, technically, I &quot;work&quot; here - as in, I get paid by this company, in exchange for reading the forums and drinking Mountain Dew all day (at least, that's what my brain has rationalized). I understand that it is really a buyers market on people with my specific talents (IE, laziness and/or caffeine addiction) - so I better play it cool when questioned. I nodded yes to the man who had asked the question.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Cool, dog...&quot; he replied, whipping out a clipboard. I glanced around the dark parking lot, wondering why the fuck I had chosen this time in particular to come out for a quick cigarette. It was about 7:30 at night, I was the last person in the office, and I had thought it might be a good idea to sneak out for one last smoke in the cool night air before heading out. I normally don't stay past 4 or 5, but today I was supposed to meet my wife for dinner at a restaurant near my office, so I figured might as well stay at work and fuck around on the forums until the time came.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;What do you need?&quot; I asked the man, pretending to be in a hurry. I'm not horribly happy dealing with... you know... random people in general. Especially when they want something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;I got this delivery here for you guys...&quot; he replied, thrusting the clipboard in my face. He gestured back towards his very old panel truck, idiling next to the loading dock.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Shipping and receiving is open until like 5, man. I think you should come back tomorrow morning...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Aw, come on man, I'm already running late...&quot; he whined, pushing the clipboard further into my face. I scanned his clothing and the truck, yet was unable to figure out what company he may work for. There was, of course, the chance that he was a spy. I took one last drag off of my cigarette and was about to reply when he cut me off...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;But it's CHRISTMAS, man.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;It's December third...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;My KIDS don't know the difference...&quot; the man almost pleaded. At this point, I started to get a little uneasy about the situation. I just nodded slowly and took the clipboard. The man smiled and pointed to the line where I had to sign... and I accepted the delivery as &quot;Alexander G. Bell&quot;, because I'm not retarded enough to put my name on anything when it comes to this company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In short order, I was presented with three boxes, ranging from very large to very small. As the man pulled away, I looked at the address labels, which were hastilly attached post-it notes with masking tape. They were intended for a co-worker who had been released back in October over a theft scandal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I opened the door and started to kick the boxes inside, weighing my options. There was no return address, no shipping label, and no indication of whom the boxes were delivered by (crazy jittery guy driving a shitty truck). Anthrax or diamonds, I was clueless as to the contents - but curiosity ended up getting me in the end, and I manuevered all the boxes into my empty office. The thought of leaving these boxes outside the door of receiving crossed my mind - but they hardly seemed important, and were intended for somebody who nobody had seen in months. I proceeded to tear into the largest of the three boxes. Nothing could prepare me for what lay within...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Globes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Not just one globe, but four globes. And a note. A cryptic note.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Hope you HAve a GLOBErious HAliday!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yes. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, over. Four spherical representations of the planet earth, all sitting on my office floor - accompanied by a note of questionable origin. I slowly moved over to the middle sized box, wondering what the hell could possibly be inside.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;More globes. Two to be exact, yet this time without a note. Now, I don't work in any industry that involves High School History teachers, cartographers, or maniacal dictators. The purpose of the gigantic, plastic planets was lost on me at the time, but I continued in my opening process. As I tore into the smallest box, I was greeted with yet another note, this one a bit more lengthy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Figured you could use this stuff for a party. We haven't talked in a while, make sure to message me. - Candice&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Inside the box were dozens upon dozens of packets. Packets of... seeds. Wildflower seeds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;And, of course, combs. Fourteen Ace combs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I stood up and backed slowly away from the loot, plopping down in my chair. A cold winter wind shook the plane of glass behind me as I stared blankly down at the assortment of &quot;party&quot; items on the floor. Globes. Seeds. Combs. Party.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I needed a drink.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;But first, I needed some kind of kind reassurance that I was still sane. Just the slightest comforting voice that said to me &quot;Hey, you're OK man. It's the WORLD that is fucked up...&quot; I tried my wife on her cell phone - no luck. Without thinking, I dialed the number to my old office down south.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, I don't really work anymore, but there was a time that I was a manager of a very large department at this company. For years I hired, trained, molded, and sometimes fired dozens and dozens of people. Relationships were formed, relationships that carried on to this day. I still get EMails and phone calls from some of my old employees - asking for my advice on certain things. I knew that one of my dearest work friends was on the night shift that evening in our corporate office, so I dialed his direct line.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Hey, I've got a bit of a problem...&quot; I started, &quot; I've come into possession of a goodly number of, um, random items.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Like what?&quot; My friend asked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Oh, like... um, globes.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;There was a bit of laughter on the other end of the phone, then a quick reply &quot;Probably for the management types there. Everybody has a globe.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This made me think. I closed my eyes and thought back to as many offices that I could remember in this company - and a startling revelation was had. EVERYBODY had a globe, but I never realized it until the motherload of earthly scale-modeling was dumped into my lap. I mean, really, how often do you notice a globe? When you see one, do you ever stop and wonder why its there? A decoration of sorts, or something more sinister... &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Hey, I've got a question for you...&quot; I was snapped back to reality by the change of subject. My friend went into a long situation about a problem that he was having with a certain aspect of his job (the job that is done by the department that I used to run). I listened intently, then suggested a course of action that, although somewhat against the norm, would alleviate the problem in a timely and orderly fashion. My friend thanked me and hung up - and I walked out the door, leaving the random items sitting on the floor of my office, vowing to deal with it at a later date.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;FIVE DAYS LATER &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;There's only so much that you can do with a globe, I had come to find out. I had taken one of them out and placed it upon my desk, and had been staring at it off and on for a day and a half. So far, the uses for a globe, as discovered by me through intense testing, were:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Spin real fast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Use your index and middle finger to &quot;run&quot; across the equator. Try to step only on land (for added difficulty points).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Play &quot;President of the United States&quot;. Spin globe real fast, close your eyes, point to place on globe. Repeat three times, declare the three indicated locations as your own personal &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; (Mine is Spain, Arizona, and the Indian Ocean).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;As I sat, slack jawed, staring at the globe... something truly horrible happened. My door swung open, and standing at the entrance to my office, was a Vice President. I knew the man well, and had worked in close conjunction with him numerous times in my old position. I hadn't seen nor heard from him since my move to the remote satellite location in Detroit. I had no idea he was even in the state, let alone the office this morning (I was unaware there was an all-employee management meeting in town). I nearly froze in fear as my right hand subconsciously scrambled for the mouse, minimizing everything on my computer screen. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Mr. Moonshine&quot;, he began, &quot;how's it going? Long time, no see.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Very well sir,&quot; I managed to form the reply. My eyes darted left and right, searching for anything incriminating in my office. Aside from OSHA posters from wall to wall, and a big pile of seeds, combs, and globes in the corner, everything looked almost professional.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;I've got a problem,&quot; he began. I gestured towards a chair across from my desk, snapping back as quickly as possible into whatever management mode I still had encoded in my brain. &quot;Well, its everybody's problem. I think you know who I'm referring to.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I shook my head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Mr. Dipshit,&quot; he continued, and I nodded. Mr. Dipshit was technically my old boss when I worked at the corporate office - but he was the epitome of everything that you would not want in an executive position. He was clueless as to the specifics of the job, poorly groomed, racist, a liar and a crook - who took personal vendettas to the next level. He also despised me from the start, as I was constantly making him look bad - because of my longevity at the company, I was friends with quite a few people in senior management, and this always frightened him. Instead of coming to him, most would go behind his back and come to me - so he had been gunning for me the entire time that we worked together. However, given my current situation, I figured that he had all but forgotten about me. I was quite wrong though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Mr. Dipshit calls me yesterday and says that you're going behind his back and trying to purposely sabotage his operation...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I blinked slightly and asked &quot;he said what?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mr. VP smiled and continued &quot;Oh, yeah - he's up in a roar. He swears that you're sitting here running the company from your desk.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I attempted to stifle a giggle. Mr. VP (who hates Mr. Dipshit as much as the next guy), nodded and said &quot;And I told him that I almost guarantee that you run his department from your desk. I've talked to some of his people down there, and they all insist that you're always there to help them out - whereas most of the time they can never find him.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I sensed that the conversation might be taking a bad turn, so I tried to turn it back, &quot;I never try to run anything. If people need help, I give that assistance - we're all on the same team sir. But, if Mr. Dipshit feels like I'm encroaching, I'll back off and let it be.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mr. VP raised his hand and shook his head, &quot;No, no. I want to make sure that things run right. I know that you're horribly busy up here, but I want to make sure that you're available for consultation, if need be.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I nodded, pretending that - in addition to my tremendous workload of posting on the SA forums - I would sacrifice and answer a couple of EMails a day, then asked, &quot;But what about Dipshit?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Don't worry about Dipshit,&quot; VP replied, snickering, &quot; He's got a hardon for you, Moonshine. In more ways than one .&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I tried not to show any emotion as my brain tried to rationalize that statement. He couldn't have meant what I thought that he meant, right? I mean, there's no way that a troll-like human being who's never been introduced to a Q-Tip or nosehair trimmer could be... no. No. No. Cleanse my thoughts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Heh&quot; I replied, my worried eyes betraying my true feelings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;I knew I could count on you, Moonshine.&quot; Mr VP said, as he stood up and walked towards the door. He stopped for a second, looking back at me. &quot;What is your title?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I snapped back to reality as soon as possible, and tried the soft answer &quot;Still a manager...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;VP nodded, then pointed at my desk, &quot;I'll make sure you get the management globe,&quot; he promised, then walked out the door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;EPILOGUE &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;My globe with the executive wooden stand appeared a few days later, and now occupies a place of honor in my small office. Every once in a while, when I leave my door open, people will walk by and glance in - and, although nearly imperceptable - I can tell that their posture straightens up a bit when their eyes come across that piece of furniture - that simple little object which says to the world &quot;I am a monster of the corporate world. Within twenty seconds I can tell you the capitol of Madagascar. Now, fetch me some coffee.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The six original globes still sit, stacked up, beside my bookcase. What to do with them remains a mystery - I'm absolutely positive that one is earmarked for my SA Secret Santa, but as for the other 5, perhaps I'll just leave them on random people's desks at work. If the secretary in accounting seems to be having a bad day, she may just come in the next day to a bright, shiny, blue ball of plastic sitting on her desk. And maybe, just maybe, that will be all the motivation needed for her to continue striving on in the corporate jungle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The seeds and combs have all been distributed by random sampling. In the spirit of the season, I went through our Microsoft Outlook address box and picked the random names of employees all across America, and sent them manilla envelopes filled with either seeds or combs, or a combination thereof - no return address, just little notes like &quot;Merry Christmas, here's a comb&quot;, and &quot;SEEDSions Greetings!&quot;. The poor man's Kris Kringle, I surely am - spreading wildflowers and well groomed hair companywide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The phone rang bright and early this monday morning. I finished the paragraph that I was reading on ESPN.COM, and went for the phone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Mr. Moonshine!&quot; came the voice from a cell phone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Mr. Vice President!&quot; I replied.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Just checking up on you - anything negative from Mr. Dipshit?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, I had received a grand total of one EMail since the last conversation, and had solved that minor problem in a grand total of five minutes. But, he didn't have to know that...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Well, there's a lot of stuff, but I'm keeping it in line, sir.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Very good, continue 'Running the company', Moonshine!&quot; he said with a laugh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Will do,&quot; I replied, and hung up the phone. I thought for a second, looked down at my cellphone, and proceeded to &quot;run the company&quot; in the most productive fashion that I could think of... &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I beat my high score in &quot;Snake&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>ActorDB – Distributed SQL database</title>
<link>https://github.com/biokoda/actordb</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/biokoda/actordb</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;README.md&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;ActorDB is a distributed SQL database...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with the scalability of a KV store, while keeping the query capabilities of a relational database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ActorDB is ideal as a server side database for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.actordb.com/docs-examples.html#example_filesync&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;apps&lt;/a&gt;. Think of running a large mail service, dropbox, evernote, etc. They all require server side storage for user data, but the vast majority of queries is within a specific user. With many users, the server side database can get very large. Using ActorDB you can keep a full relational database for every user and not be forced into painful scaling strategies that require you to throw away everything that makes relational databases good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ActorDB is a database that does not hide sharding from you. It makes it explicit, so you can keep fully relational chunks (i.e. actors) for the 99% of your database queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if your data model is not easily partitioned, ActorDB has a powerful KV data type that you can use instead. An &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.actordb.com/docs-kvstore.html#about_kv_store&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ActorDB KV&lt;/a&gt; type is an sql table that is partitioned across all servers. That table can have sub tables linked to it using foreign keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can run queries or transactions on a single actor or across any number of actors. ActorDB can run on a single server or many servers. Writing to one actor is completely independent of writes to another actor, unless they are participating in the same transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Servers can be added and schema can be updated at any time while the database is running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homepage: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.actordb.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.actordb.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any questions you can use: &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitter.im/actordb/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://gitter.im/actordb/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ActorDB is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A distributed relational SQL database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistent (not eventually consistent).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distributed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redundant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Massively concurrent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No single point of failure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ACID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connectable over MySQL protocol and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/biokoda/actordb/blob/master/adbt.thrift&quot;&gt;Thrift&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replicated safely using the Raft distributed consensus algorithm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advantages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Complete horizontal scalability. All nodes are equivalent and you can have as many nodes as you need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full featured ACID database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suitable for very large datasets over many actors and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No special drivers needed. Use the mysql driver of your language of choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to configure and administer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No global locks. Only the actors (one or many) involved in a transaction are locked during a write. All other actors are unaffected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses stable reliable SQL and storage engines: SQLite on top of LMDB.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inherits SQLite features like JSON support and common table expressions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Would you like to contribute?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we would most like to see is more client libraries on top of Thrift. Thrift generated code can be a bit verbose. Generally it is much nicer to implement an interface to it that hides some boilerplate code and uses nicer types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also if you have any ideas, thoughts on possible improvements or bugs to report, contact us using github issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you're interested in contributing. Use your language of choice. Generate a thrift interface using our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/biokoda/actordb/blob/master/adbt.thrift&quot;&gt;adbt.thrift&lt;/a&gt;, then write a clean interface to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will list any outside contributions here.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Eight hours a night isn’t enough, according to a leading sleep scientist</title>

<description>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For something that we spend a third of our lives doing (if we’re lucky), sleep is something that we know relatively little about. “Sleep is actually a relatively recent discovery,” says Daniel Gartenberg, a sleep scientist who is currently an assistant adjunct professor in biobehavioral health at Penn State. “Scientists only started looking at sleep 70 years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As anyone who has lay awake at night contemplating the complexities of the universe can attest, sleep is a slippery beast. It involves a complex web of biological and neurological processes, all of which can be thrown off by something as simple as a partner’s nasal trumpeting or a coffee too late in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also many, many misconceptions about sleep: that you can “&lt;a href=&quot;https://sleepjunkies.com/features/the-33-biggest-myths-about-sleep-and-insomnia-de-bunked/&quot;&gt;catch up&lt;/a&gt;” on the weekend for lost hours of shuteye. That you can get by on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-fact-fiction&quot;&gt;four hours’ sleep&lt;/a&gt; a night. That a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/news/20130118/alcohol-sleep&quot;&gt;nip of whiskey&lt;/a&gt; before bed helps you sleep better. Even that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120417-does-cheese-give-you-nightmares&quot;&gt;eating cheese before snoozing&lt;/a&gt; causes nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To set the record straight about being horizontal, Quartz spoke to one of the world’s most-talked-about sleep scientists. &lt;a href=&quot;http://danielgartenberg.com/&quot;&gt;Daniel Gartenberg&lt;/a&gt; is currently working on research funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Aging and is also a TED resident. (Watch his talk on deep sleep &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gartenberg_the_brain_benefits_of_deep_sleep_and_how_to_get_more_of_it&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) He’s also an entrepreneur who has launched several cognitive-behavioral-therapy apps, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1193763939&quot;&gt;Sonic Sleep Coach alarm clock&lt;/a&gt;. All that with 8.5 hours’ of sleep a night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some topics we cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;why 8.5 hours of sleep is the new eight hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the genes that dictate if you’re a morning person or a night owl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why you should take a nap instead of meditating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how sleep deprivation can be a tool to fight depression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why sleep should be the new worker’s rights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and tips on how to get a better night’s rest (hint: it’s not your Fitbit)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also read Gartenberg’s comments on “sleep inertia”—the scientific reason why you feel so groggy when you wake up—&lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1301170/sleep-inertia-explains-why-you-feel-so-groggy-when-you-wake-up/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This interview has been lightly condensed and edited for clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quartz: Why do we need sleep?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel Gartenberg: Every organism on the planet sleeps in some fashion, to some degree—even the basic fruit fly. What makes sleep so essential for our wellbeing comes down to three main things: to save our energy, to help our cells recover, and to help us process and understand our environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This third one is what I study. The “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14638388&quot;&gt;synaptic homeostasis hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;” is this idea that during the day, we make all these connections with the world around us. It used to be like, “Don’t go over there—the lions live there now.” Now it’s like, “What did Barbara say to me in the office?” These excitatory connections we make during the day result in the neurons in our brains getting overall higher activation. Then during the nighttime when we sleep, we have a downregulating process where the things that didn’t really matter to your survival sink to the bottom, and the things that are most relevant to your survival rise to the top. What deep sleep does is all the neural processing, and what REM sleep [rapid-eye-movement sleep] and light sleep do is basically integrate that into your long-term personality and understanding of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What other differences are there between deep sleep and REM sleep?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people don’t understand that these are two very, very different processes. A lot of people probably learned from basic psych in high school that you have these sleep stages: light sleep &amp;gt; deep sleep &amp;gt; light sleep &amp;gt; REM, and repeat. As you sleep more, you get less and less deep sleep, and also if you sleep-deprive yourself, you get more deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During deep sleep, you get these long-burst brainwaves that are called delta waves, but during REM, your brainwaves are actually functioning very similarly to waking life. Your body is also paralyzed during REM—it’s a very noticeable physiological difference. You also lose thermo-regulation, meaning if it’s hot in your environment, your body gets hot, kind of like you’re a chameleon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your whole thing is that deep sleep is more important than REM sleep. Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an ongoing debate in the literature—really, it’s both. Deep sleep is really important, but REM sleep is also important. We know that the human growth hormone, cell-recovery things, and the ability to process new information are associated with deep sleep. REM sleep is basically the processing of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asking for the workaholics in the room: Do we &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need that much sleep?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A professor I collaborate with at Penn State named Orfeu Buxton says that 8.5 hours of sleep is the new eight hours. In order to get a healthy eight hours of sleep, which is the amount that many people need, you need to be in bed for 8.5 hours. The standard in the literature is that healthy sleepers spend more than 90% of the time in bed asleep, so if you’re in bed for eight hours, a healthy sleeper might actually sleep for only about 7.2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote-line&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;8.5 hours of sleep is the new eight hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote-line&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;That being said, some people are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/genetic-mutation-sleep-less/&quot;&gt;short sleepers&lt;/a&gt;: You can do a test to find out if you have genetic makeup that makes you a short sleeper. That’s rare, though, so by and large, people are not getting enough sleep. Getting half an hour less than what you need to really adds up over a week period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see how much sleep you really need, my professor suggests that when you go on vacation, try to stick to your normal bedtime and then see what time you wake up. With no stressors or time to get up, you’ll just fall into a natural pattern, and that’s probably how much sleep you actually need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I normally get around six to seven hours of sleep a night and feel fine. But is that just because how I feel has become my normal operating mode, and I could really be functioning at a higher level?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right. That’s like the fish and the fish bowl phenomenon: The fish doesn’t know that he’s in the fishbowl, nonetheless that he’s in water. Also, when you’re sleep deprived, research has shown that you’re really bad at being able to tell that you’re sleep deprived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of this has to do with stress in our environment and our external need to work all the time. This is what’s driving the fact that we’re sleeping so poorly nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How else does the workplace affect sleep?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think of sleep like the new worker’s rights: We’re being worked to the point that we’re not sleeping, and it’s having physical detriments on our health and wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People should be able to sleep like they’re able to get healthcare. This also means making our work environments more conducive to sleep. For optimum productivity, we need around eight hours of sleep, right? But that doesn’t have to be in one go. Maybe I’ll get a little less than that during the night, and then I’ll take a 20-to-30-minute power nap at midday. There’s a siesta for a reason! New Yorkers oftentimes try to pound through with coffee and whatever, but giving in to your natural circadian rhythm during that afternoon lull might be a good thing. We weren’t made to produce for eight hours straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s talk more about circadian rhythms. What are they, and why are they responsible for that mid-afternoon slump?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We evolved from bacteria in the ocean that could differentiate sunlight from darkness—that’s what ended up forming the human eye. That means every organism is responsive to a circadian rhythm that’s largely dictated by sunlight. The photo receptors in our eyes pick up on sunlight, which controls the release of melatonin and all these other neurotransmitters that dictate your energy levels throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have a peak moment of awakeness during the morning. After lunch you usually have a glucose spike, especially if you have a big heavy lunch, like a cheeseburger. That glucose spike combined with a circadian dip gives you a period of fatigue between around 2 and 4pm. You’ll then have another spike in alertness right before dinner, and then you’ll start getting tired again closer to bedtime. That’s your 24-hour circadian rhythm, basically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s also something called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chronobiology.com/about-chronobiology/&quot;&gt;chronobiology&lt;/a&gt;.” You actually have genes that dictate whether you’re a morning person or an evening person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait—what? Really?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah! If you’re a morning person, they call it a lark. If you’re a night person, they call it a night owl. Your genes give you a greater proclivity to being a lark or an owl. And then some people have genes that make them very flexible. The environmental cues they react against are called &lt;em&gt;zeitgebers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lightsabers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zeitgebers&lt;/em&gt;! It’s this weird German word. There’s a lot of cool words in sleep: like the photo receptors control the release of melatonin by sending signals to the &lt;em&gt;suprachiasmatic nucleus&lt;/em&gt;, just like &lt;em&gt;supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote-line&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;You actually have genes that dictate whether you’re a morning person or an evening person.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote-line&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Anyway, basically your biggest zeitgeber is sunlight, and that’s the environmental cue that controls energy levels as well. But then also timing of meals, exercise, and having a consistent bedtime are all zeitgebers that impact your circadian rhythm. A bigger part of the problem is that we’re indoors so much now, so we don’t get that natural occurring sunlight when you wake up in the morning. That’s one of the best things that you can do to entrench your circadian rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your circadian rhythm is off, it negatively impacts your sleep quality. So having that consistent rhythm of going to bed and getting up at the same time will actually make your sleep more regenerative at night. Going for a walk outside and getting that sunlight in the morning is the best thing to do to wake up. Your circadian rhythm isn’t a fixed thing: It’s actually shiftable based on your environmental cues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you wake up in the middle of the night (say, to go to the bathroom) but get back to sleep quickly, does that screw around with your sleep quality?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It varies. There’s no clear answer. In our studies, we’ll play really loud sounds that people have no conscious awareness of at all: We can play a sound literally at 70 decibels, which is like someone screaming, and that’ll wake them up briefly and then they’ll go right back into the sleep stage that they were in. Other times you can get a full awakening, and you’ll have to go through the process again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s actually pretty normal to wake up during the night, anyway. In &lt;em&gt;The Canterbury Tales&lt;/em&gt;, one of the oldest manuscripts in English culture, they describe “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-used-to-sleep-in-two-shifts-maybe-we-should-again&quot;&gt;second sleep&lt;/a&gt;.” There’s some evidence that we used to go to bed when the sun went down, then wake up for a little bit at night—putter around, make sure we’re not getting eaten by a lion—and then go back to sleep. So it’s pretty normal to like wake up in the middle of the night and use the bathroom or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is society changing our relationship with sleep? What will be the consequences of this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gallup has reported that over the past 50 years, &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.gallup.com/poll/166553/less-recommended-amount-sleep.aspx&quot;&gt;we’re sleeping a whole hour less per night&lt;/a&gt; than we did in the 1950s. That’s a lot. A lot of that has to do with having TV on all the time, and mobile phones are taking it to the next level. But I think the biggest issue right now is the lack of work/life balance. I mean, I’m an entrepreneur, so I feel like I’m basically always “on”. A lot of people have jobs where they’re getting emails all hours the night, and there’s no longer a nine-to-five schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that’s why meditation is so in vogue right now. But I actually think sleep is a more regenerative process than meditation. A lot of times people talk about doing meditation around midday, but for most people I would recommend a quick power nap instead of a quick meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But if I try to take a powernap at lunch and can’t get to sleep, haven’t I just wasted 20 minutes of my day that I could have been meditating—or working?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when you close your eyes and turn off your brain for little bit—even if you don’t fully fall asleep—your brain creeps into theta waves. Similarly, when you meditate, you get a little bit of theta. So if you’re one of these people who really has a hard time with napping, maybe meditation could be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote-line&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Taking a break—whether it’s meditation or nap—during the circadian dip can be much more conducive to productivity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote-line&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The most important thing is taking that time off—it’s more conducive to your productivity. A lot of times people think they can like fight through and push harder and harder and harder to get better results, but sleep can give you that, too. When you transition in and out of sleep, your brain produces theta waves, which help you think more divergently. That’s why a lot of times when you wake up from a power nap or from sleeping, you’ll be able to solve that intractable problem that you couldn’t earlier in the day. That’s one of the reasons I think taking a break—whether it’s meditation or nap—during that circadian dip can be much more conducive to productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially true for creative jobs. Jobs used to be very manual, but as jobs are becoming more and more cognitive, I think caring for your cognition is going to become increasingly important for the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some tips for getting a better sleep?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want a cold, quiet environment with no light: That’s basically the ideal way to improve your sleep quality. However, people have a different ideal sound, light, and temperature environment to improve their sleep quality. We need stimulus control: You want to save the bedroom for sleep and sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOUND&lt;/strong&gt;: We focus on sound a lot. Quiet environments are going to improve your sleep quality. Your brain has these micro arousals throughout the night without you being consciously aware of it—even an air-conditioning unit turning on wakes up your brain. So blocking out noises is a low-hanging fruit to improve your sleep quality. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/noise_masking_sleepbuds/noise-masking-sleepbuds.html&quot;&gt;Bose just released an earbud&lt;/a&gt; that you can sleep with, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s this new finding where playing sounds at a certain frequency when your brain is in deep sleep actually increases the percentage of time spent in deep sleep. We’re publishing this paper in Society for Neuroscience Conference in a couple of weeks, and it’s basically &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gartenberg_the_brain_benefits_of_deep_sleep_and_how_to_get_more_of_it&quot;&gt;what my TED talk is about&lt;/a&gt;. Playing these pulses at the same frequency as your deep-sleep brainwaves primes more deep sleep. Scientifically speaking, it’s a similar process as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/psychiatry/specialty_areas/brain_stimulation/tdcs.html&quot;&gt;transcranial direct-current stimulation&lt;/a&gt;, except it doesn’t use electricity—just sound. Sound gets transmitted into electricity because you’re picking up on the auditory cortex while you’re sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEMPERATURE&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a big problem, especially if you have a sleep partner. Everyone has different natural body temperatures, and usually men run hotter than women, but it can go either way. That can be a big issue if you have a different body temperature, because then no one’s happy. I wrote this article called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/im-thinking-about-sleeping-and-science_us_593aaa5ae4b014ae8c69df9e&quot;&gt;Split blankets, not beds&lt;/a&gt;,” where I said that you shouldn’t share the same comforter. Of course it’s nice to share, and I do that at some points, but it’s also important to have different bedding on your bed so you can have that lighter sheet or comforter to try to mitigate differences in body temperature. There’s also something called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1301123/why-eight-hours-a-night-isnt-enough-according-to-a-leading-sleep-scientist/chilly%20pad&quot;&gt;chili pad&lt;/a&gt;. You put on half of your bed and it’ll dictate the temperature level on your half if you run at a different temperature than your sleep partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIGHT&lt;/strong&gt;: The other thing is no blue light close to bedtime. There are a lot of studies that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side&quot;&gt;screen time close to bed is bad&lt;/a&gt;. One of the ideal ways of using our app is to connect it to your Bluetooth speakers so that you can put your phone in another room: There is something important to not having your phone in reach, because then you’re looking at the screen and getting the brightness. If you live in the city and there’s bright lights at night, having blackout shade can also be super useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STRESS&lt;/strong&gt;: When you’re stressed, your flight-or-fight response is active during the night, and your sleep quality is going to be shallow. It’s natural: If you have kids, you are programmed to be able to respond to your environment during the night to make sure you’re not getting eaten by a predator. Parents have this issue when their fight-or-flight response system is overly activated by worrying about their kid, and that worry actually makes their sleep quality worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I recommend to people who have a racing mind and worrying thoughts about work is to segment a time to get it out during the day—encapsulate it in a little mental box so you’re not laying down in bed and just having your mind race about all these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you feel about sleep trackers and wearables?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the most common wearable to measuring sleep right now is the Fitbit. I’ve studied these devices in depth in a well-controlled laboratory experiment where we’re monitoring brainwaves. I can say the Fitbit is pretty accurate in measuring when you’re asleep and when you’re wake, but when it comes to measuring sleep stages, basically any device that measures heart rate, like the Apple Watch, is totally inaccurate. That’s because they don’t sample at the frequency necessary to get a good read on your sleep stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitbits can also cause bigger problems, because they stress you out about the fact you think you’re not getting enough deep sleep—even though they’re not good at accurately measuring sleep stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about people who mess with their sleep cycle and try things like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/430415/i-once-tried-to-cheat-sleep-and-for-a-year-i-succeeded/&quot;&gt;da Vinci method&lt;/a&gt;, where you take a 20-minute nap every four hours?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That &lt;a href=&quot;http://time.com/5063665/what-is-polyphasic-sleep/&quot;&gt;polyphasic sleep&lt;/a&gt; stuff? I mean, it’s just not enough sleep. It’s ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t seen a study that empirically shows that it’s helpful. There is certainly a false myth that we need eight hours of &lt;em&gt;continuous&lt;/em&gt; sleep: I think it’s possible to have your sleep be a little bit broken up and be perfectly healthy—but getting that eight hours is crucially important. The thing is that the placebo effect in some of these polyphasic sleep methods runs really high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There have also been some studies showing that &lt;a href=&quot;https://mosaicscience.com/story/staying-awake-surprisingly-effective-way-treat-depression/&quot;&gt;sleep deprivation&lt;/a&gt; could be a tool to combat persistent depression. How do you feel about that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was really interesting. If you have an extreme case of depression, sometimes some therapists will sleep deprive you a little bit. It’s basically to activate your fight-or-flight response and jolt you out of your depression. But things like empathy and working with others are also impacted when you’re sleep deprived, and you’re also more sensitive to pain. Some people are studying this link to address the opioid epidemic and through actually sleeping better: Chronic pain might be associated with deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Luxury hotels are being inundated with requests from self-described influencers</title>
<link>https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/06/instagram-influencers-are-driving-luxury-hotels-crazy/562679/?single_page=true</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/06/instagram-influencers-are-driving-luxury-hotels-crazy/562679/?single_page=true</guid>
<description>&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-0&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Three years ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/bylisalinh/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'562679'&quot;&gt;Lisa Linh&lt;/a&gt; quit her full-time job to travel the world and document it on Instagram, where she has nearly 100,000 followers; since then, she has stayed in breathtaking hotels everywhere from Mexico to Quebec to the Cook Islands. Often, she stays for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Linh is part of an ever-growing class of people who have leveraged their social media clout to travel the world, frequently in luxury. While Linh and other elite influencers are usually personally invited by hotel brands, an onslaught of lesser-known wannabes has left hotels scrambling to deal with a deluge of requests for all-expense-paid vacations in exchange for some social media posts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Kate Jones, marketing and communications manager at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dusit.com/dusitthani/maldives/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'562679'&quot;&gt;Dusit Thani&lt;/a&gt;, a five-star resort in the Maldives, said that her hotel receives at least six requests from self-described influencers per day, typically through Instagram direct message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“Everyone with a Facebook these days is an influencer,” she said. “People say, I want to come to the Maldives for 10 days and will do two posts on Instagram to like 2,000 followers. It's people with 600 Facebook friends saying, ‘Hi, I'm an influencer, I want to stay in your hotel for 7 days,’” she said. Others send vague one-line emails, like “I want to collaborate with you,”with no further explanation. “These people are expecting five to seven nights on average, all inclusive. Maldives is not a cheap destination.” She said that only about 10 percent of the requests she receives are worth investigating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned=&quot;&quot; data-instgrm-permalink=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BZy-olfDpUA/&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BZy-olfDpUA/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'4',r'562679'&quot;&gt;A post shared by ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀ ⠀✨🦋Caroline Einhoff🦋✨ (@caro_e_)&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time datetime=&quot;2017-10-03T18:50:26+00:00&quot;&gt;Oct 3, 2017 at 11:50am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Jack Bedwani, who runs &lt;a href=&quot;http://theprojects.com/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'562679'&quot;&gt;The Projects&lt;/a&gt;, a brand consulting agency that works with several top hospitality brands, said that he’s close with the PR manager for a new hotel and day club in Bali. “They get five to 20 direct inquiries a day from self-titled influencers,” he said. “The net is so wide, and the term ‘influencer’ is so loose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“You can sort the amateurs from the pros very quickly,” Bedwani said.“The vast majority of cold-call approaches are really badly written. It sounds like when you're texting a friend inviting yourself over for dinner—it's that colloquial. They don't give reasons why anyone should invest in having them as a guest.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Some hotels report being so overwhelmed by influencer requests that they've simply opted out. In January, a luxury boutique hotel in Ireland &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/hotel-bans-influencers-instagram-social-media-stars-elle-darby-the-white-moose-cafe-a8166926.html&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'6',r'562679'&quot;&gt;made headlines&lt;/a&gt; for banning all YouTubers and Instagram stars after a 22-year-old requested a free five-night stay in exchange for exposure.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“If I let you stay here in return for a feature in a video, who is going to pay the staff who look after you? Who is going to pay the housekeepers who clean your room? ... Who is going to pay for the light and heat you use during your stay? Maybe I should tell my staff they will be featured in your video in lieu of receiving payment for work carried out while you’re in residence?” the owner wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/WhiteMooseCafe/posts/2048406742106598&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'7',r'562679'&quot;&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-permalink=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BgDPPP1n0PD/&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;But to influencers themselves, this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the value exchange. Instagram has ballooned to more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/25/instagram-now-has-800-million-monthly-and-500-million-daily-active-users/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'9',r'562679'&quot;&gt;800 million monthly active users&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2014-11-20/how-to-use-instagram-as-travel-guide&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'10',r'562679'&quot;&gt;many of whom come to it for travel ideas&lt;/a&gt;, and influencers argue that the promotions they offer allow hotels to directly market to new audiences in an authentic way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;They're not completely wrong. Most hotels acknowledge that there's some benefit to working with influencers, it's just that determining how to work with them—and manage their requests—is a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Some hotels, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.acehotel.com/contact/influencer-media-stay&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'11',r'562679'&quot;&gt;the Ace&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.starwoodhotelshawaii.com/influencer&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'12',r'562679'&quot;&gt;and others&lt;/a&gt;, have attempted to standardize the process by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hels/status/954404411425607681&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'13',r'562679'&quot;&gt;requiring detailed influencer application forms&lt;/a&gt; for discounts or free hotel stays. Others list influencer-specific contact addresses on their website. But the majority of hotels deal with influencer requests the old-fashioned way, through an email to the hotel’s primary address. Many influencers use an email template that they customize for each property when requesting a stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Hotels evaluate influencers on several criteria, trying to sift through an enormous amount of BS. “We have quite a strict process,” said Jones. “We look at engagement more than anything else ... We have to filter out influencers who have basically bought bots. There's a lot of those these days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-permalink=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/Bgovilel_4g/&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laurie Hobbs, director of public relations and marketing at Ocean House Management, a resort management company that operates several boutique hotels in Rhode Island, said the hotel keeps a database of trusted influencers who it has partnered with before and can rely on when launching new products—recently, a customized &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.classygirlswearpearls.com/2017/05/the-lilly-pulitzer-suite.html&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'15',r'562679'&quot;&gt;Lilly Pulitzer suite&lt;/a&gt;. When new influencers approach one of their properties, Hobbs and her team take a close look at the influencer's follower count and aesthetic to make sure it's the right fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Joe Miragliotta, a men's lifestyle and travel blogger who says he’s stayed in hundreds of hotels as an influencer, hates the fact that so many ham-handed wannabes are giving influencers a bad name. “You've seen the bad emails like, ‘Can you believe this influencer reaching out to me for a free stay!?’ That's a bad thing. That makes us all look bad,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Miragliotta said having a clear pitch and meaningful deliverables can make all the difference to a hotel brand manager. “Having a one-sheet is really nice,” he said. “Have your demographics on lockdown. Have an elevator pitch. Know your audience … If you don't know your audience, brands don't know you. You could have 100 million followers, but they won't know who you're marketing to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-permalink=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BjtpoAEhCxw/&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Linh said that while hotels are still trying to figure out the return on working with influencers, it can be helpful to provide more than just social media posting. “We can film something for their website, or provide imagery,” she said. “They can save money by hiring an influencer vs hiring professional photographers or videographers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Other influencers have gotten even more creative with the services they offer. Zach Benson, who owns a network of travel Instagram accounts and who says he has gotten more than 200 nights for free over the past year and a half, touts his background in digital marketing when he approaches hotels. Along with the traditional Instagram posts and Stories, Benson offers to work with a hotel's digital marketing arm to improve the brand's in-house social media accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“We really want to help people and make their companies and hotels better,” he said. “We know that just doing a couple Instagram posts for them isn't really going to help them that much.” During his travels, Benson hosts boot camps for hotel social media teams, where he trains employees on things like Facebook ads and Instagram promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-permalink=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/Be6Y6_Ug3Ry/&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“I just think a lot of the influencers have entitlement mentality,” Benson said. “A lot of them think about giving the bare minimum.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Bedwani said that it's critical that hotels set explicit terms in their deals with influencers. “I know a major brand that opened up and flew in a plane full of influencers,” he said. “Three-quarters of them didn't even post. It was a major fail from their team.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Jones, meanwhile, said the Dusit Thani Maldives has all but ceased working with fashion influencers after she discovered that many simply wanted a pretty backdrop for their swimsuit shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“10 different bikini pictures a day on the beach is great for the bikini company,” she said. “But you can't even tell where it's taken. It could be anywhere in the Maldives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Some of these issues can just be a miscommunication. Miragliotta said he’s invested in making clients happy—but hotels need to make sure they're organized and prepared for influencer stays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-permalink=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BkA-Rj2hYE9/&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I went to one Mexico resort and three different people were giving me different hashtags and handles,” he said. “I was with five other influencers and we were excited to post, but there was limited Wi-Fi. If you don't have the simplest things ready for us, then that makes it difficult to produce the content you need, or do it correctly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Natalie Zfat, a social media consultant and influencer who has partnered with hotel chains like Marriott and InterContinental, said that at the end of the day most bloggers and influencers are just businesspeople.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“Could you think of any other business industry where it would be frowned upon for someone to reach out to a potential client and offer them an opportunity? You'd never see Coca Cola berate an ad salesperson at CNN for calling them up and sharing their rates.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>No Copyright Law: The Real Reason for Germany’s Industrial Expansion? (2010)</title>
<link>http://m.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/no-copyright-law-the-real-reason-for-germany-s-industrial-expansion-a-710976.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://m.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/no-copyright-law-the-real-reason-for-germany-s-industrial-expansion-a-710976.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;article-function-box clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-function-date&quot;&gt;&lt;time class=&quot;timeformat&quot; datetime=&quot;2010-08-18 16:52:06&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 18, 2010&lt;/strong&gt;  04:52 PM&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire country seemed to be obsessed with reading. The sudden passion for books struck even booksellers as strange and in 1836 led literary critic Wolfgang Menzel to declare Germans &quot;a people of poets and thinkers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&quot;That famous phrase is completely misconstrued,&quot; declares economic historian Eckhard Höffner, 44. &quot;It refers not to literary greats such as Goethe and Schiller,&quot; he explains, &quot;but to the fact that an incomparable mass of reading material was being produced in Germany.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Höffner has researched that early heyday of printed material in Germany and reached a surprising conclusion -- unlike neighboring England and France, Germany experienced an unparalleled explosion of knowledge in the 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German authors during this period wrote ceaselessly. Around 14,000 new publications appeared in a single year in 1843. Measured against population numbers at the time, this reaches nearly today's level. And although novels were published as well, the majority of the works were academic papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation in England was very different. &quot;For the period of the Enlightenment and bourgeois emancipation, we see deplorable progress in Great Britain,&quot; Höffner states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equally Developed Industrial Nation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, only 1,000 new works appeared annually in England at that time -- 10 times fewer than in Germany -- and this was not without consequences. Höffner believes it was the chronically weak book market that caused England, the colonial power, to fritter away its head start within the span of a century, while the underdeveloped agrarian state of Germany caught up rapidly, becoming an equally developed industrial nation by 1900.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more startling is the factor Höffner believes caused this development -- in his view, it was none other than copyright law, which was established early in Great Britain, in 1710, that crippled the world of knowledge in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany, on the other hand, didn't bother with the concept of copyright for a long time. Prussia, then by far Germany's biggest state, introduced a copyright law in 1837, but Germany's continued division into small states meant that it was hardly possible to enforce the law throughout the empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Höffner's diligent research is the first academic work to examine the effects of the copyright over a comparatively long period of time and based on a direct comparison between two countries, and his findings have caused a stir among academics. Until now, copyright was seen as a great achievement and a guarantee for a flourishing book market. Authors are only motivated to write, runs the conventional belief, if they know their rights will be protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet a historical comparison, at least, reaches a different conclusion. Publishers in England exploited their monopoly shamelessly. New discoveries were generally published in limited editions of at most 750 copies and sold at a price that often exceeded the weekly salary of an educated worker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London's most prominent publishers made very good money with this system, some driving around the city in gilt carriages. Their customers were the wealthy and the nobility, and their books regarded as pure luxury goods. In the few libraries that did exist, the valuable volumes were chained to the shelves to protect them from potential thieves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Germany during the same period, publishers had plagiarizers -- who could reprint each new publication and sell it cheaply without fear of punishment -- breathing down their necks. Successful publishers were the ones who took a sophisticated approach in reaction to these copycats and devised a form of publication still common today, issuing fancy editions for their wealthy customers and low-priced paperbacks for the masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Multitude of Treatises&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This created a book market very different from the one found in England. Bestsellers and academic works were introduced to the German public in large numbers and at extremely low prices. &quot;So many thousands of people in the most hidden corners of Germany, who could not have thought of buying books due to the expensive prices, have put together, little by little, a small library of reprints,&quot; the historian Heinrich Bensen wrote enthusiastically at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prospect of a wide readership motivated scientists in particular to publish the results of their research. In Höffner's analysis, &quot;a completely new form of imparting knowledge established itself.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially the only method for disseminating new knowledge that people of that period had known was verbal instruction from a master or scholar at a university. Now, suddenly, a multitude of high-level treatises circulated throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;Literature Newspaper&quot; reported in 1826 that &quot;the majority of works concern natural objects of all types and especially the practical application of nature studies in medicine, industry, agriculture, etc.&quot; Scholars in Germany churned out tracts and handbooks on topics such as chemistry, mechanics, engineering, optics and the production of steel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In England during the same period, an elite circle indulged in a classical educational canon centered more on literature, philosophy, theology, languages and historiography. Practical instruction manuals of the type being mass-produced in Germany, on topics from constructing dikes to planting grain, were for the most part lacking in England. &quot;In Great Britain, people were dependent on the medieval method of hearsay for the dissemination of this useful, modern knowledge,&quot; Höffner explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The German proliferation of knowledge created a curious situation that hardly anyone is likely to have noticed at the time. Sigismund Hermbstädt, for example, a chemistry and pharmacy professor in Berlin, who has long since disappeared into the oblivion of history, earned more royalties for his &quot;Principles of Leather Tanning&quot; published in 1806 than British author Mary Shelley did for her horror novel &quot;Frankenstein,&quot; which is still famous today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'Lively Scholarly Discourse'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade in technical literature was so strong that publishers constantly worried about having a large enough supply, and this situation gave even the less talented scientific authors a good bargaining position in relation to publishers. Many professors supplemented their salaries with substantial additional income from the publication of handbooks and informational brochures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Höffner explains that this &quot;lively scholarly discourse&quot; laid the basis for the Gründerzeit, or foundation period, the term used to describe the rapid industrial expansion in Germany in the late 19th century. The period produced later industrial magnates such as Alfred Krupp and Werner von Siemens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market for scientific literature didn't collapse even as copyright law gradually became established in Germany in the 1840s. German publishers did, however, react to the new situation in a restrictive way reminiscent of their British colleagues, cranking up prices and doing away with the low-price market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors, now guaranteed the rights to their own works, were often annoyed by this development. Heinrich Heine, for example, wrote to his publisher Julius Campe on October 24, 1854, in a rather acerbic mood: &quot;Due to the tremendously high prices you have established, I will hardly see a second edition of the book anytime soon. But you must set lower prices, dear Campe, for otherwise I really don't see why I was so lenient with my material interests.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>No Copyright Law: The Real Reason for Germany's Industrial Expansion? - SPIEGEL ONLINE - International</og:title>
<og:description>Did Germany experience rapid industrial expansion in the 19th century due to an absence of copyright law? A German historian argues that the massive proliferation of books, and thus knowledge, laid the foundation for the country's industrial might.</og:description>

<title>Messi Walks Better Than Most Players Run</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;In the 12 years since he became the youngest Argentine to score a World Cup goal, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lionel-messi-is-impossible/&quot;&gt;Lionel Messi&lt;/a&gt; has won more Ballon d’Or trophies, awarded to the world’s best player, than anyone before him.&lt;a class=&quot;espn-footnote-link&quot; data-footnote-id=&quot;1&quot; href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/messi-walks-better-than-most-players-run/#fn-1&quot; data-footnote-content=&quot;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cristiano Ronaldo has since tied him with five.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;ss-1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; He has scored &lt;a href=&quot;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1456355-breaking-down-lionel-messis-magical-91-goal-year-for-barcelona-and-argentina&quot;&gt;more official goals in a calendar year&lt;/a&gt; than anyone in living memory. He is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bdfutbol.com/en/c/rankingG1.html&quot;&gt;top scorer of all time&lt;/a&gt; in Spain’s La Liga, and this season, his performances have been characteristically devastating:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;footer class=&quot;viz&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;* Among attackers with minimum 850 minutes played&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;source&quot;&gt;Source: Football Whispers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, in part because of the juvenile nature of soccer analysis, we have barely scratched the surface of understanding quite &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; Messi does it. This is most true when looking at his movement. Messi may get the ball more than most, but he, like all players, still spends the majority of his time without it — making runs, hiding in space, creating space for his teammates. It’s an integral part of his game that we know almost nothing about. The &lt;em&gt;outcomes&lt;/em&gt; are there for all to see, but the &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt; is obfuscated — we observe and quantify what Messi does on the ball, and are blind when he is off it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout his career, Messi &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espnfc.com/uefa-champions-league/story/1780845/stats-show-how-barcelonas-lionel-messi-failed-to-influence-atletico-madrid-game&quot;&gt;has been criticized for walking&lt;/a&gt;. After an El Clasico match between Barcelona and Real Madrid in December 2017, there was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/how-barcas-lionel-messi-decided-the-clasico-in-walking-mode-6517548&quot;&gt;widespread coverage&lt;/a&gt; of the fact that Messi walked 83 percent of the roughly 5 miles he covered that game. Despite this, he scored and assisted in Barca’s 3-0 trouncing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This season in the Champions League (the only competition to release this basic running data), Messi ran comfortably less than any other elite attackers, averaging just less than 5 miles per 90 minutes. Naturally, a large portion of how much you run will be based on the team you play for and your role on that team. Teams that defend more will tend to cover larger distances, while certain tactical styles expect more of their forwards — Roberto Firmino of high-pressing Liverpool covered almost 7 miles per 90 minutes. But Cristiano Ronaldo of Real Madrid — which, like Barcelona, doesn’t press particularly stringently in its opponent’s half — averaged four-fifths of a mile more than Messi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve known this trait of Messi’s for quite some time: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/sports_nut/2014/07/lionel_messi_2014_world_cup_the_world_s_best_player_has_figured_out_how.html?via=gdpr-consent&quot;&gt;In 2014 World Cup coverage&lt;/a&gt;, Ken Early remarked that “only Messi has figured out how to win matches by moving less than everyone else.” Benjamin Morris wrote about the phenomenon &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/was-lionel-messi-tired/&quot;&gt;for FiveThirtyEight&lt;/a&gt; after Argentina lost to Germany in the final. The most popular explanation has been that Messi walks to conserve his energy for critical moments, like a perfectly efficient machine. But even when he’s walking, new research suggests, he’s far from idle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke Bornn, vice president of strategy and analytics for the Sacramento Kings, and Javier Fernandez, a data scientist at FC Barcelona, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sloansportsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1003.pdf&quot;&gt;presented research&lt;/a&gt; at this year’s MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference in Boston that helps us shed some light on the phenomenon. Soccer is fundamentally a game of space and movement, so Bornn and Fernandez devised models using positional data that evaluate the occupation and generation of space by players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can see at every instant the location of each player and the ball, and from this deduce how players’ movements create space for themselves and others,” Bornn said. “We can also see whether they do that actively, by running into open spaces, or passively, by staying in high-value locations while the play shifts away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase “high-value locations” refers to another part of their research that quantified how much areas of the pitch are &lt;em&gt;worth&lt;/em&gt; to either team. A rudimentary measure would simply be distance to goal, but after discussions with experts at Barcelona, Fernandez and Bornn realized that the value of space in soccer changes dynamically based on the positions of the players and the ball. Instead, they took the novel approach of extracting the value of space based on the behavior of the defending team. At the aggregate level, defenders will look to cut off the areas that are most dangerous relative to where the ball is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch how Messi passively gains space on the right wing for Barcelona during an attack, with a dual view showing how Bornn and Fernandez dynamically value space behind the Villarreal defenders:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applying the models to data from that La Liga match between Barcelona and Villarreal in January 2017, Bornn and Fernandez found that Barcelona’s most important principle space gainers were Sergio Busquets, Andres Iniesta and Messi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They divide this space gain into two types: “active,” in which the player is moving at running speed, and “passive,” in which he is not. Iniesta and Busquets were passive just 43 percent and 52 percent of the time they held valuable positions. Remarkably, in about 66 percent of the moments Messi won control of valuable space, he was walking. Even while strolling, he is helping his team by holding ground in valuable areas, waiting for the ball to come to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also looked at space generation and reception, when a moving player creates space for his teammates by dragging an opposing defender with him. In the same match, Messi was one of Barcelona’s top three players in terms of gaining space, along with Luis Suarez and Neymar. The three of them, in Barcelona’s devastating 4-3-3, would spread out wide across the pitch, forcing defenders to follow them. Bornn and Fernandez found that Messi and Suarez had a “special connection,” generating considerable amounts of space for each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether Messi consciously decides to go against the run of play with his movement is difficult to ascertain. “Can we say Messi gets a lot of his space by not chasing the play? Yes, that’s precisely what our research shows.” Bornn said. “Is he doing it deliberately? To answer that, you’d probably have to ask the man himself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he battles to cement his reputation this summer, Messi will be under more scrutiny than ever before. &lt;a href=&quot;http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lionel-messis-majestic-season/&quot;&gt;We’re used to seeing him&lt;/a&gt; provide dazzling passes, incisive shots and glamorous dribbles, but we shouldn’t be afraid to keep our eyes on him even when the ball is elsewhere, and especially if he is moving slowly. For Messi never really walks; he prowls.&lt;/p&gt;

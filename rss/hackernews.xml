<title>The Benjamin Franklin method for learning more from programming books</title>
<link>http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/01/the-benjamin-franklin-method-of-reading.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/01/the-benjamin-franklin-method-of-reading.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it, programming books suck. Those general books on distributed systems or data science or whatever can be tomes for a lifetime, but, with few exceptions, there’s something about the books on how to write code in a language/framework/database/cupcake-maker, the ones with the animal covers and the cutesy sample apps, they just tend to be so forgettable, so trite, so….uneducational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I’ve figured out why I don’t like them, and it’s not just that they teach skills rapidly approaching expiration. It’s their pedagogical approach. The teaching algorithm seems to be: write these programs where we’ve told you everything to do, and you’ll come out knowing this language/framework/database/cupcake-maker. Central to these books are the long code listings for the reader to reproduce. Here’s an example, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.railstutorial.org/book/advanced_login#sec-forgetting_users&quot;&gt;one of the better books in this category&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;ApplicationRecord&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;attr_accessor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;:remember_token&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;before_save&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;downcase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;validates&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;:name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span&gt;presence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;maximum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;50&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;VALID_EMAIL_REGEX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;/\A[\w+\-.]+@[a-z\d\-.]+\.[a-z]+\z/i&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;validates&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;:email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;presence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;maximum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;255&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span&gt;format:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;VALID_EMAIL_REGEX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span&gt;uniqueness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;case_sensitive:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;has_secure_password&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;validates&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;:password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;presence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;minimum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span&gt;# …another 30 lines follows...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, there are two ways to study a page like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Type out every line of code &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy+paste the code from their website, maybe play around and make small changes &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approach #1 is a method that, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blogger.com/&quot;&gt;like a lecture&lt;/a&gt;, causes the code to go from the author’s page to the reader’s screen without passing through the heads of either. The second is like trying to learn how to make a car by taking apart a seatbelt and stereo: you’re just toying with small pieces. Neither is a sound way to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you had an expert tutor, they wouldn’t teach you by handing you a page of code. Still, these books are what we have. How can we read them in a way that follows the principles of learning? Read on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mental Representations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to K. Anders Ericsson in his book Peak, expertise is a process of building mental representations. We can see this because expert minds store knowledge in a compressed fashion. Musicians can memorize a page of music far faster than a page of random notes. Expert chess players told to memorize a board position will do much better than amateurs, but, when they make a mistake, they’ll misplace whole groups of pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is possible because music and chess positions have structure that makes them look very different from a page of random notes or a random permutation of pieces. Technically speaking, they have lower &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perplexity&quot;&gt;perplexity&lt;/a&gt; than random noise. So, even though there are 26 letters in the English alphabet, Claude Shannon showed that the information content of English is about 1 bit per letter: given a random prefix of a paragraph, people can guess the next letter about half the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why a programmer skilled in a technology can look at code using it and read through it like fiction, only pausing at the surprising bits, while the novice is laboring line-by-line. This is also why a s&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~yahave/papers/pldi14-statistical.pdf&quot;&gt;mart code-completion tool &lt;/a&gt;can guess a long sequence of code from the first couple lines. With a better mental representation, understanding code is simply less work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;246&quot; src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/HKSIE2WwzQ1Dcy5a44Q_VdYa2Xa7bB3mHtawUEOIFw0wwXZVOsIWU9NziprAG_5ecdihSfvgoQ0h5yV_JyNYmvsronm1ODIpj2CjwqMcWyAs8eL0y5ErLyLKIqXNLSkPZDcpWfDK&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(How do these mental representations work? My officemate Zenna Tavares argues they are &lt;a href=&quot;https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BJVEEF9lx&quot;&gt;distribution-sensitive data structures&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what’s missing from the “just type out the code” approach: there’s nothing forcing your mind to represent the program as anything better than a sequence of characters. Yet being able to force your mind to do this would mean being able to learn concepts more rapidly. Here’s a 200 year-old idea for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Benjamin Franklin Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what’s more impressive: that Benjamin Franklin became a luminary in everything from politics to physics, or that he did this without modern educational techniques such as schools, teachers, or StackOverflow. As part of this, he discovered a powerful method of self-study. I’ll let him speak for himself (or go read &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/personal-growth/the-benjamin-franklin-method-how-to-actually-learn-to-write-1ac4ebc7c3a7&quot;&gt;someone else’s summary&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot; readability=&quot;24&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About this time I met with an odd volume of the Spectator. It was the third. I had never before seen any of them. I bought it, read it over and over, and was much delighted with it. I thought the writing excellent, and wished, if possible, to imitate it. With this view I took some of the papers, and, making short hints of the sentiment in each sentence, laid them by a few days, and then, without looking at the book, try'd to compleat the papers again, by expressing each hinted sentiment at length, and as fully as it had been expressed before, in any suitable words that should come to hand. Then I compared my Spectator with the original, discovered some of my faults, and corrected them.&lt;/p&gt;
—Benjamin Franklin, Autobiography&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process is a little bit like being a human autoencoder. An autoencoder is a neural network that tries to produce output the same as its input, but passing through an intermediate layer which is too small to fully represent the data. In doing so, it’s forced to learn a more compact representation. Here, the neural net in question is that den of dendrons in your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K. Anders Ericsson likens it to how artists practice by trying to imitate some famous work. Mathematicians are taught to attempt to prove most theorems themselves when reading a book or paper --- even if they can’t, they’ll have an easier time compressing the proof to its basic insight. I used this process to get a better eye for graphical design; it was like LASIK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the basic version idea applied to programming books is particularly simple yet effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here’s how it works:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read your programming book as normal. When you get to a code sample, read it over&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then close the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then try to type it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple, right? But try it and watch as you’re forced to learn some of the structure of the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a lot like the way you may have already been doing it, just with more learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Acknowledgments&lt;/h2&gt;

<title>Why I don&amp;#039;t use my real photo when messaging with customers on my website</title>
<link>https://www.kapwing.com/blog/why-i-dont-use-my-real-photo/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.kapwing.com/blog/why-i-dont-use-my-real-photo/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I’m a 24-year-old female web developer and founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kapwing.com&quot;&gt;Kapwing&lt;/a&gt;, an early-stage software startup. When my co-founder, Eric, and I launched the website in October, we decided to add a chat messenger so that users could message us directly with feedback, feature requests, and bugs. In this post, I’ll tell the story of how user responses changed when we changed the photo and gender of our website’s customer support agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Kapwing is a more full-featured online video editor, but at first, it was just a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kapwing.com/meme-maker&quot;&gt;meme maker&lt;/a&gt;. When we launched the MVP, we integrated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drift.com&quot;&gt;Drift&lt;/a&gt;, a messaging widget for websites, so we could connect with our users in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SGadUZy.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chat box on Kapwing&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When users come to our website (usually because they Google something like “How to make a video meme”), a chat window pops up in the bottom right corner of the screen with my photo and pre-set welcome message. Users can respond to, dismiss, or ignore the chat box. Since users can report their pain points in real time, many of the comments and questions have been useful as we try to fix bugs and prioritize new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;as-julia-enthoven&quot;&gt;As “Julia Enthoven”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we first added the chat box, I set up a ‘Welcome’ message, added my real name, and posted my LinkedIn photo, not thinking anything of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3pgYpnT.png&quot; alt=&quot;Drift welcome message&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of our website users didn’t message back, but some did, and we benefited a lot from feedback in the early stages of the website. But I also got a surprising number of offensive comments. Just about twice a day, a user responded to my welcome message with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rude comments: Aggressive threats and name calling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heckling and sexual harassment: People commenting on my looks, making sexual jokes, asking me out, sending suggestive photos and emojis, and generally creeping on me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trolls: Offensive and sarcastic nonsense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I generally have tough skin for these sorts of things, and, for about a month, I mostly just laughed and ignored the messages. I alternated between my social media feeds full of #MeToo statuses and the Drift app full of heckling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, on Nov 30, I got seven crude insults from users before showing up to the office. Annoyed, I told Eric I wanted to make a change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;as-eric-lu&quot;&gt;As “Eric Lu”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Utzb0SF.png&quot; alt=&quot;Eric Lu&quot;/&gt; We decided to switch to my co-founder’s photo and name to see if it would help reduce the amount of harassment. I would still be the one receiving and responding to messages, but users would think they were chatting with “Eric Lu.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the harassment instantly dried up. Under Eric’s name, I got equally as many questions about our video editor from frustrated and happy users. But four days later I hadn’t gotten any obnoxious or lewd comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yEtgHbr.png?1&quot; alt=&quot;Kind2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result&lt;/strong&gt;: In seven days as “Eric Lu”, I got only one rude-ish message, and it was less severe or personal than comments I’d gotten before. This was the worst:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OeWdtJT.png?1&quot; alt=&quot;Rude1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Tacu8C0.png?1&quot; alt=&quot;Rude2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;as-rachel-gray&quot;&gt;As “Rachel Gray”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nLkEi0U.jpg?1&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel profile&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of changing from my own photo to Eric’s was so dramatic that we decided to investigate further. I found a stock photo of a blonde woman who was attractive in an obvious way and chose a stock name - “Rachel Gray” - to see how users’ responses compared. I switched our message avatar from Eric to “Rachel,” and immediately - less than one hour in after changing the photo - the heckling and name-calling resumed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result&lt;/strong&gt;: Rachel had it worse than I did. When I counted after three weeks of messaging with Rachel’s name and photo, I saw that we got about 50% more crude, aggressive, and nonsense messages with her avatar compared to mine. People asked her to go on dates, demanded that she share nude photos, and pleaded for all kinds of sexual favors. People called her names, cursed her out, asked her where she lived, and threatened her and the website. Mean, lewd messages came in from all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than the creeps, trolls, and bullies, I didn’t notice a shift in the types of questions people were asking - users with problems on Kapwing still asked Rachel for help. But we didn’t analyze the volume of messages, so I can’t say if Rachel got more or fewer messages overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;as-team-kapwing&quot;&gt;As “Team Kapwing”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9TCCt6j.jpg?1&quot; alt=&quot;Team Kapwing profile pic&quot;/&gt; For the last experimental iteration, we changed the photo to our website logo, the androgynous “Kapwing kitten,” with the name “Team Kapwing”. Team Kapwing was up for three weeks (from just before Christmas into January).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result&lt;/strong&gt;: Users acted more respectful and friendly than they had towards Rachel. People still complained, reported bugs, and got frustrated when things broke - we had a server malfunction that broke the website for several hours in December - but users comments weren’t personal. Apparently, people don’t hit on cats, so I was mostly free from harassment for a while. &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gGjcays.png?1&quot; alt=&quot;When I mistakenly told a user my name&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over these three month, more than 55,000 people have visited the Kapwing website and have made more than 100,000 videos. To date, we’ve had more than 2,100 messages. Our informal study on the name and appearance of the customer support agent implied a bias against women: &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/P4QCWO4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chatbox sexism graphic&quot;/&gt; Of course, our experiment wasn’t a rigorous scientific study. Since we did not run the conditions at the same time, there were other variables at work. For example, we ran the Drift experiment over the holidays, which probably changes usage patterns and people’s overall mood/stress levels. We were also growing Kapwing, adding features that appealed to new audiences, and steadily increasing our website traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have three brothers, majored in computer science, and now am starting a company from a Silicon Valley VC office, so I’ve dealt with my fair share of sexism through the years. But this is the first time I have experienced first-hand how differently I would be treated if I could change my gender, at least on the internet. Naively, I was shocked and intrigued by how much more respectful people were to Eric than to me behind the anonymity of a chat box. In the end, we landed on “Team Kapwing” as our messaging support agent, although it’s still always me who talks to users. Here are some takeaways for other website owners:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re a female with a chat box, you might want a pseudonym&lt;/strong&gt;: Hiding behind Kapwing’s logo and company name on our messenger makes customer support easier and less discouraging. With the “Team Kapwing” name, people tend to assume that the person responding to them is a dude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider the appearance of your support agents&lt;/strong&gt;: Your customers want someone who looks trustworthy and real, not cute or fake. Represent yourself as an on-brand expert in whatever industry your business operates in and experiment with different faces to see what works best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customer support is very human&lt;/strong&gt;: Even though the internet puts distance and anonymity between website creators and their users, remember that there are humans on both sides of the screen. People love to chat, tease, and make friends, even if they know nothing about each other. They make spelling mistakes, jump to conclusions, use emojis and slang, and can be inpatient and insensitive. Although users are sometimes hurtful, it’s fun (and sometimes a waste of time) to connect directly with the real people using your product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading! Keep reading this blog to follow along as Eric and I grow Kapwing to ramen profitability.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Whether the&lt;/em&gt; Andrea Gail &lt;em&gt;rolls, pitch-poles, or gets driven down, she winds up, one way or another, in a position from which she cannot recover. Among marine architects this is known as the zero-moment point – the point of no return.” –Sebastian Junger, “The Perfect Storm”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posts like this aren’t my usual fare, but there’s a lot of readers on Tumblr. So y’all might be interested – or, if not, you really should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, this went down:&lt;/p&gt;

Let me paint you a different picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday morning, every single Barnes &amp;amp; Noble location – that’s 781 stores – told their full-time employees to pack up and leave. The eliminated positions were as follows: the head cashiers (those are the people responsible for handling the money), the receiving managers (the people responsible for bringing in product and making sure it goes where it should), the digital leads (the people responsible for solving Nook problems), the newsstand leads (the people responsible for distributing the magazines), and the bargain leads (the people responsible for keeping up the massive discount sections). A few of the larger stores were able to spare their head cashiers and their receiving managers, but not many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just about everyone lost between 3 and 7 employees. The unofficial numbers put the total around 1,800 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/4388660b2be11a33b84ce8d15c06647f/tumblr_inline_p45ygqWgDB1r4pnzr_500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;750&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;758&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;505&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/a3220b8a2ea1d0792704ad75b696f7e0/tumblr_inline_p45ygx4rFb1r4pnzr_500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;750&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;947&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;631&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re not talking post-holiday culling of seasonal workers. This was the Red Wedding. &lt;em&gt;Every person laid off was a full-time employee&lt;/em&gt;. These were people for whom Barnes &amp;amp; Noble was a career. Most of them had given 5, 10, 20 years to the company. In most cases it was their sole source of income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it gets worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who lost their jobs had been &lt;em&gt;actively assured this would NOT happen&lt;/em&gt; for the past several months. Home Office decided last year that these positions – head cashiers, receiving managers, leads – were due to be eliminated… &lt;em&gt;but no layoffs were to take place.&lt;/em&gt; All current employees were to be grandfathered in. The positions wouldn’t go away until the people currently holding them &lt;em&gt;chose to leave&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For months they told everyone this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then on Monday, each person was called into the manager’s office. Fifteen minutes later, each person gathered up their things and left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/735fc18459b9f991c485cf9d601b0bfa/tumblr_inline_p45z9mQmqJ1r4pnzr_500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;750&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;623&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;415&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Severance packages varied; usually as little as two weeks pay. Demotions were not offered. Those laid off – and I’d like to reiterate that these were &lt;em&gt;career employees&lt;/em&gt; – were offered the opportunity to reapply for part-time positions. At base pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thanks for your 17 years of service. If you’d like to come back in two months to work registers for minimum wage, we’d love to have you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Don’t let the glamor of book sales fool you. B&amp;amp;N entry pay is minimum wage.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now. You’re going to hear a lot about the dropped sales. You’re going to hear a lot about Amazon. You’re going to hear about how there was no way around this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, dear friends, is bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/c9041ac330ad66a32d964cc1242a1303/tumblr_inline_p45ytxN7TD1r4pnzr_500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;750&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;937&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;624&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/b0146c2329ffa58226aedfd371739b79/tumblr_inline_p45yu4AfVt1r4pnzr_500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;750&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;807&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;538&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to talk to you about why sales dropped during the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A company wants cash on hand to look good to stockholders. The quickest way for a company to get cash on hand is to cut back on payroll. Which Barnes &amp;amp; Noble did this holiday season. During December, staffing at most locations was no different than it would be on your average day in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something kinda important is happening in December, btw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/a9cbfbdd6c99cd8ad53373deb7d8f484/tumblr_inline_p45yus9Ffu1r4pnzr_500.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;600&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;400&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, hours in receiving were carved to the bone. You know what that means? It means that product – product that could be selling – sat unopened in boxes. In many cases, those boxes had already been logged into the system. The computers showed we had them. Customers came in, expecting to purchase things, knowing they were in the store! But what they wanted was buried under 100, 200 boxes. And there were no employees to find them. There were barely any employees available at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers went away annoyed. And they shopped on Amazon instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because, well, why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As a side note: people often want to know why Amazon’s prices are so much lower than B&amp;amp;N’s, and why B&amp;amp;N doesn’t price match. There’s a lot of different reasons, but the biggest is that Amazon loss-leads their books: that is, sells them at a loss, then makes up the money with expensive add-ons, like Echos or Kindles or other non-book stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/63ead700e2478c71ef7944751c364156/tumblr_inline_p45yvjuDM71r4pnzr_500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;750&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;632&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;421&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barnes &amp;amp; Noble only has books; they can’t make up the discount loss by selling water coolers. Amazon undercuts prices, and once they’re the only players in the market, that will stop. Just so you know.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, sales sucked. Cutting hours during the busiest season of the year punched quarter earnings in the gut. Big shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you were trying to solve the problem – if you were trying to revitalize this business – what would you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Oh, I know! I would tighten my belt at the executive level, then I would double-down on what we can offer that Amazon can’t: enthusiastic staff that can find and upsell books to suit each customer, and the largest in-store selection possible so that everyone who comes in can walk away with what they want. If I absolutely had no choice but to reduce payroll, I would eliminate some part-time positions, and count on the knowledge and experience of our veterans to get us through the lean times.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/0ae8734d4f4184e8ac3d9f6032d0047f/tumblr_inline_p45yx4jqx31r4pnzr_250.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;244&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;244&quot; width=&quot;244&quot; height=&quot;244&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are definitely the choices you would make if you wanted to rebuild a company to last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s a secret:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Barnes &amp;amp; Noble executives do not intend to rebuild.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I know this? Because every decision from the upper levels is being made solely to increase cash on hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s been so many things – so many things – but me tell you about the canary in the coal mine. Let me tell you how I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; saving Barnes &amp;amp; Noble is not in the home office’s plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last summer, the decision was made to switch to “ship from store”. Previously, when a customer ordered a book online, the book would be shipped to them from one of our warehouses. The new policy, however, had stores taking books off their shelves, packaging them up, and sending them out each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was to “decrease shipping time by sending books from the closest location to the customer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Spoiler alert: that wasn’t true.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So each store takes employees off the selling floor – where they could, you know, help customers – and sets them to fill orders. The stores remove books from their own shelves and mail them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stores do not get credit for those sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me repeat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The stores do not get credit for those sales&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;company&lt;/em&gt; makes money. The brick and mortar store – which &lt;em&gt;Barnes &amp;amp; Noble is based on&lt;/em&gt; – loses the opportunity to sell that book (pissing off customers), and gets nothing in return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which hurts the bottom line of that store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Uh-oh, your sales dropped. Better cut back hours.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a decision that is only made if the executive level of a company is no longer interested in helping their business. This is a decision that is made only if the executive level has decided the company is dying, and don’t care if they hasten along the demise as long as they can harvest the organs for themselves and leave everyone else with the shriveled husk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of organ harvesters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/1e08532124f05ead823b6b2bb9cf8e8f/tumblr_inline_p45z3wqudp1r4pnzr_500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;750&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;787&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;524&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the way, it should be noted that the last CEO, who worked for Barnes &amp;amp; Noble for less than a year, received a $4,500,000 payout. The CEO before him, who &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; worked at Barnes &amp;amp; Noble for less than a year, received a $10,000,000 payout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/458c1ffd869e0dc9562285a1c750bbee/tumblr_inline_p45z4yop6c1r4pnzr_1280.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;750&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;1263&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;842&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company saved $40m by firing 1,800 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After paying out $14,500,000 to two executives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us back around to Monday’s layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By getting rid of their most expensive (ie, most experienced) workers, B&amp;amp;N was able to replace said workers with part-time, benefit-less, minimum-wage employees. This is not to knock newbies – we were all ones once! – but a new hire can’t do what a 15 year veteran can. They just can’t. Not right away. Not for a long time. And not in the specialized departments that were laid off: head cashiering, receiving, digital, newsstand, bargain. Those are &lt;em&gt;hard jobs&lt;/em&gt; that take training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who’s going to train?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And who’s going to want to be trained for something that hard, when there’s no possibility of a promotion down the line? When you’re only working minimum wage for a maximum of 25 hours a week?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of this post, I quoted Junger and the zero-moment point. The loss of these veterans, and the positions they worked, cannot be recovered from. Barnes &amp;amp; Noble is going under.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/3c322c1f6f587dd6a498eaff8e5e7b4c/tumblr_inline_p45z6hed2v1r4pnzr_500.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;499&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;262&quot; width=&quot;499&quot; height=&quot;262&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“That sucks, but it’s the way capitalism works. Hate the game, not the player.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure. Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday morning, as thousands of lives were upended, Barnes &amp;amp; Noble – literally in the same hour – released this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/54b5a1b256346dc592dfc4fdab51d258/tumblr_inline_p45z7tZozT1r4pnzr_1280.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;750&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;1242&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;828&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/96133dad90e34e4be846e0ecb2c4850a/tumblr_inline_p45z82F81J1r4pnzr_500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;740&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;342&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;231&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His deep knowledge of retail and proven track record are exactly what we need to invigorate our merchandising strategy and grow our business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grow our business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/32e672c4eddc1a3d9ab7b6733f6979e8/tumblr_inline_p45zabPzkm1r4pnzr_500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;750&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;694&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;462&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what happens after Barnes &amp;amp; Noble sinks. It’s all well and good to say “Support indie stores!” but there are huge swaths of America where there &lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt; any. B&amp;amp;N is the last thing standing between Amazon and a total monopoly of the publishing industry, and a monopoly is never a good thing. But the entire book world needs to be prepared, because it’s coming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zero-moment point came Monday, and in the crassest, cruelest, more heartless way possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnes &amp;amp; Noble has slit its own wrists. Now we just wait to bleed out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google removes ‘view image’ button from search results</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/15/17017864/google-removes-view-image-button-from-search-results</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/15/17017864/google-removes-view-image-button-from-search-results</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;NGdl3u&quot;&gt;Google is making a change to image search today that sounds small but will have a big impact: it’s removing the “view image” button that appeared when you clicked on a picture, which allowed you to open the image alone. The button was extremely useful for users, since when you’re searching for a picture, there’s a very good chance that you want to take it and use it for something. Now, you’ll have to take additional steps to save an image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;VvIkus&quot;&gt;The change is essentially meant to frustrate users. Google has long been under fire from photographers and publishers who felt that image search allowed people to steal their pictures, and the removal of the view image button is one of many changes being made in response. A deal to show copyright information and improve attribution of Getty photos was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/9/16994508/google-copyright-disclaimers-getty-images-search&quot;&gt;announced last week&lt;/a&gt; and included these changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;bQQqsL&quot; readability=&quot;6.5046296296296&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;6.9382716049383&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Today we're launching some changes on Google Images to help connect users and useful websites. This will include removing the View Image button. The Visit button remains, so users can see images in the context of the webpages they're on. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/n76KUj4ioD&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/n76KUj4ioD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Google SearchLiaison (@searchliaison) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/searchliaison/status/964226180776845312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 15, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;VcuOjo&quot;&gt;The intention seems to be either stopping people from taking an image altogether or driving them through to the website where the image is found, so that the website can serve ads and get revenue and so people are more likely to see any associated copyright information. That’s great news for publishers, but it’s an annoying additional step for someone trying to find a picture. Now you’ll have to wait for a website to load and then scroll through it to find the image. Websites sometimes disable the ability to right click, too, which would make it even harder for someone to grab a photo they’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;sen1ay&quot;&gt;Fortunately, there’s still at least one way around it: if you right click, you can select “open image in new tab” or “view image” (or whatever your browser’s equivalent option is), and you’ll still open up the full-size picture. It’s just a bit less likely that everyone will realize this is an option. And since the “visit” site button is now the most visible button, that’s probably what’ll end up getting clicked the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nDCdNt&quot;&gt;In addition to removing the “view image” button, Google has also removed the “search by image” button that appeared when you opened up a photo, too. This change isn’t quite as big, however. You’ll still be able to do a reverse image search by dragging the image to the search bar, and Google will still display related images when you click on a search result. The button may have been used by people to find un-watermarked versions of images they were interested in, which is likely part of why Google pulled it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;FYXfk9&quot;&gt;While it’s good to see Google protecting photographers and driving traffic to websites, it’s still hard not to be a little annoyed by the changes. There are plenty of legitimate and legal uses for copyrighted images. And while it’s fair to ask users to do their due diligence by making sure they’re properly attributing photos, these changes really seem designed to stop images from being grabbed in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>FCC’s Inspector General investigating whether Ajit Pai acted inappropriately</title>
<link>https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mb53jn/fcc-inspector-general-investigation-ajit-pai-corruption</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mb53jn/fcc-inspector-general-investigation-ajit-pai-corruption</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;FCC boss Ajit Pai is being investigated by his own agency over potential corruption allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The already-unpopular agency boss has been on a tear in recent months &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/paadj8/the-fcc-is-using-an-obsolete-loophole-to-help-a-pro-trump-media-company-take-over-local-tv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gutting decades old media-consolidation rules&lt;/a&gt; designed to protect consumers and the nation’s media markets from any one broadcaster becoming too powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pai’s efforts arrived, not coincidentally, at the same time Sinclair Broadcasting Group is attempting to acquire Tribune Media as part of a $3.9 billion dollar megamerger. It’s a deal a &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wjjkxm/liberals-and-conservatives-attack-tv-merger-that-would-let-pro-trump-media-dominate-local-news&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bipartisan chorus of critics&lt;/a&gt; say would demolish media diversity, resulting in Sinclair owning more than 230 local stations across 72 percent of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given criticism of Sinclair for its often &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/sinclair-requires-tv-stations-including-komo-to-air-segments-that-tilt-to-the-right/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;distorted and inaccurate&lt;/a&gt; news reporting, consumer advocates say the deal would have a profoundly negative impact on the quality and diversity of media discourse, as well as already dwindling competition in the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without Pai’s assistance on this front, the Sinclair merger would have been impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; indicates that the FCC’s Inspector General has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/technology/fcc-sinclair-ajit-pai.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;launched an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into whether Pai acted inappropriately as he rushed to dismantle media consolidation rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late last year, &quot;the top internal watchdog for the F.C.C. opened an investigation into whether Mr. Pai and his aides had improperly pushed for the rule changes and whether they had timed them to benefit Sinclair,&quot; the report states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was unclear the extent of the inspector general’s investigation or when it might conclude, but the inquiry puts a spotlight on Mr. Pai’s decisions and whether there had been coordination with the company,&quot; said the Times. &quot;It may also force him to answer questions that he has so far avoided addressing in public.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy and Commerce Ranking Member Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ), who has been calling for an inquiry for much of last year, was quick to applaud the revelations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For months I have been trying to get to the bottom of the allegations about Chairman Pai’s relationship with Sinclair Broadcasting,” Pallone &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FrankPallone/status/964155021687435264&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am particularly concerned about reports that Chairman Pai may have coordinated with Sinclair to time a series of Commission actions to benefit the company,” Pallone added. “I am grateful to the FCC’s Inspector General that he has decided to take up this important investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer groups were similarly-quick to pounce on the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Until the inspector general’s investigation is complete, Chairman Pai and any other FCC staff subject to this inquiry should recuse themselves from all dealings related to Sinclair’s proposed takeover of Tribune Media,&quot; Free Press Senior Counsel Jessica J. González said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If the investigation finds that Pai or any other FCC staff did indeed let their own bias and favoritism shape decisions related to the deal, they must not be permitted to vote on this matter and they should be subject to other appropriate ethics-review processes,” González added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inquiry joins a rotating crop of other investigations into Pai’s behavior during his first controversial year as agency head. A GAO inquiry is &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/10/fccs-ddos-claims-will-be-investigated-by-government/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;also looking into&lt;/a&gt; why Pai’s FCC appears to have made up a DDOS attack in order to try and downplay massive public opposition to the agency’s repeal of popular net neutrality rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pai’s agency is also facing numerous lawsuits over allegations that Pai ignored the public as he rushed to repeal those rules. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman penned an open letter to Pai last year effectively accusing him of &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@AGSchneiderman/an-open-letter-to-the-fcc-b867a763850a&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blocking a law enforcement inquiry&lt;/a&gt; into the numerous bogus comments that flooded the agency in support of its unpopular repeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pai has frequently &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/washington/pai-serves-zingers-dc-dinner/170519&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;made light&lt;/a&gt; of concerns he’s too cozy with the giant corporations he’s supposed to be holding accountable. And while these investigations and lawsuits may or may not culminate in evidence of corruption or violation of agency rules, Pai’s policies alone leave few questions about where his loyalties lie.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Rust 1.24</title>
<link>https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/02/15/Rust-1.24.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/02/15/Rust-1.24.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Rust team is happy to announce a new version of Rust, 1.24.0. Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, getting Rust 1.24.0 is as easy as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;rustup update stable
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have it already, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html&quot;&gt;get &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustup&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the appropriate page on our website, and check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-1240-2018-02-15&quot;&gt;detailed release notes for 1.24.0&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-in-1240-stable&quot;&gt;What’s in 1.24.0 stable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release contains two very exciting new features: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustfmt&lt;/code&gt; and incremental compilation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;rustfmt&quot;&gt;rustfmt&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years now, we’ve wanted a tool that automatically can reformat your Rust code to some sort of “standard style.” With this release, we’re happy to announce that a &lt;em&gt;preview&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustfmt&lt;/code&gt; can be used with 1.24 stable. To give it a try, do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;rustup component add rustfmt-preview
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two important aspects here: first, you’re using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustup component add&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cargo install&lt;/code&gt; here. If you’ve previously used &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustfmt&lt;/code&gt; via &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cargo install&lt;/code&gt;, you should uninstall it first. Second, this is a preview, as it says in the name. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustfmt&lt;/code&gt; is not at 1.0 yet, and some stuff is being tweaked, and bugs are being fixed. Once &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustfmt&lt;/code&gt; hits 1.0, we’ll be releasing a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustfmt&lt;/code&gt; component and deprecating &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustfmt-preview&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the near future, we plan on writing a post about this release strategy, as it’s big enough for its own post, and is broader than just this release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more, please check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustfmt&lt;/code&gt; on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;incremental-compilation&quot;&gt;Incremental compilation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in September of 2016 (!!!), we blogged about &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/09/08/incremental.html&quot;&gt;Incremental Compilation&lt;/a&gt;. While that post goes into the details, the idea is basically this: when you’re working on a project, you often compile it, then change something small, then compile again. Historically, the compiler has compiled your &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; project, no matter how little you’ve changed the code. The idea with incremental compilation is that you only need to compile the code you’ve actually changed, which means that that second build is faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Rust 1.24, this is now &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/4817&quot;&gt;turned on by default&lt;/a&gt;. This means that your builds should get faster! Don’t forget about &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cargo check&lt;/code&gt; when trying to get the lowest possible build times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is still not the end story for compiler performance generally, nor incremental compilation specifically. We have a lot more work planned in the future. For example, another change related to performance hit stable this release: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/46910&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;codegen-units&lt;/code&gt; is now set to 16 by default&lt;/a&gt;. One small note about this change: it makes builds faster, but makes the final binary a bit slower. For maximum speed, setting &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;codegen-units&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Cargo.toml&lt;/code&gt; is needed to eke out every last drop of performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More to come!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;other-good-stuff&quot;&gt;Other good stuff&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s one other change we’d like to talk about here: undefined behavior. Rust generally strives to minimize undefined behavior, having none of it in safe code, and as little as possible in unsafe code. One area where you could invoke UB is when a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;panic!&lt;/code&gt; goes across an FFI boundary. In other words, this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-rust highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;C&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;panic_in_ffi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;panic!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cannot work, as the exact mechanism of how panics work would have to be reconciled with how the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;C&quot;&lt;/code&gt; ABI works, in this example, or any other ABI in other examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Rust 1.24, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/46833&quot;&gt;this code will now abort&lt;/a&gt; instead of producing undefined behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-1240-2018-02-15&quot;&gt;detailed release notes&lt;/a&gt; for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;library-stabilizations&quot;&gt;Library stabilizations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a fan of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;str::find&lt;/code&gt;, which is used to find a given &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; inside of a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;str&lt;/code&gt;, you’ll be happy to see this pull request: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/46735&quot;&gt;it’s now 10x faster&lt;/a&gt;! This is thanks to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;memchr&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[u8]::contains&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/46713&quot;&gt;uses it too&lt;/a&gt;, though it doesn’t get such an extreme speedup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a few new APIs were stabilized this release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, these functions may now be used inside a constant expression, for example, to initialize a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Cell&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RefCell&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UnsafeCell&lt;/code&gt;’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; functions of the various &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Atomic&lt;/code&gt; integer types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;{integer}::min_value&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;max_value&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mem&lt;/code&gt;’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;size_of&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;align_of&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ptr::null&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;null_mut&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-1240-2018-02-15&quot;&gt;detailed release notes&lt;/a&gt; for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;cargo-features&quot;&gt;Cargo features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big feature of this release was turning on incremental compilation by default, as mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-1240-2018-02-15&quot;&gt;detailed release notes&lt;/a&gt; for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;contributors-to-1240&quot;&gt;Contributors to 1.24.0&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people came together to create Rust 1.24. We couldn’t have done it without all of you. &lt;a href=&quot;https://thanks.rust-lang.org/rust/1.24.0&quot;&gt;Thanks!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Picking Apart the Crashing iOS String</title>
<link>https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2018/02/15/picking-apart-the-crashing-ios-string/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2018/02/15/picking-apart-the-crashing-ios-string/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;So there’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/15/17015654/apple-iphone-crash-ios-11-bug-imessage&quot;&gt;yet another iOS text crash&lt;/a&gt;, where just looking at a particular string crashes iOS. Basically, if you put this string in any system text box (and other places), it crashes that process. I’ve been testing it by copy-pasting characters into Spotlight so I don’t end up crashing my browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original sequence is U+0C1C U+0C4D U+0C1E U+200C U+0C3E, which is a sequence of Telugu characters: the consonant ja (జ), a virama ( ్ ), the consonant nya (ఞ), a zero-width non-joiner, and the vowel aa ( ా).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was pretty interested in what made this sequence “special”, and started investigating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So first when looking into this, I thought that the &amp;lt;ja, virama, nya&amp;gt; sequence was the culprit. That sequence forms a special ligature in many Indic scripts (ज्ञ in Devanagari) which is often considered a letter of its own. However, the ligature for Telugu doesn’t seem very “special”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, from some experimentation, this bug seemed to occur for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; pair of Telugu consonants with a vowel, as long as the vowel is not  ై (ai). Huh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ZWNJ must be doing something weird, then. &amp;lt;consonant, virama, consonant, vowel&amp;gt; is a pretty common sequence in any Indic script; but ZWNJ before a vowel isn’t very useful for most scripts (except for Bengali and Oriya, but I’ll get to that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I saw that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FakeUnicode/status/963300865762254848&quot;&gt;there was a sequence in Bengali&lt;/a&gt; that also crashed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sequence is U+09B8 U+09CD U+09B0 U+200C U+09C1, which is the consonant “so” (স), a virama ( ্ ), the consonant “ro” (র), a ZWNJ, and vowel u (  ু).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get too into this, let’s first take a little detour to learn how Indic scripts work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Indic scripts and consonant clusters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indic scripts are &lt;em&gt;abugidas&lt;/em&gt;; which means that their “letters” are consonants, which you can attach diacritics to to change the vowel. By default, consonants have a base vowel. So, for example, क is “kuh” (kə, often transcribed as “ka”), but I can change the vowel to make it के (the “ka” in “okay”) का (“kaa”, like “car”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, the default vowel is the ə sound, though not always (in Bengali it’s more of an o sound).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the “default” vowel, you need a way to combine consonants. For example, if you wished to write the word “ski”, you can’t write it as स + की (sa + ki = “saki”), you must write it as स्की. What’s happened here is that the स got its vowel “killed”, and got tacked on to the की to form a consonant cluster ligature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; write this as स्‌की . That little tail you see on the स is known as a “virama”; it basically means “remove this vowel”. Explicit viramas are sometimes used when there’s no easy way to form a ligature, e.g. in ङ्‌ठ because there is no simple way to ligatureify ङ into ठ. Some scripts also &lt;em&gt;prefer&lt;/em&gt; explicit viramas, e.g. “ski” in Malayalam is written as സ്കീ, where the little crescent is the explicit virama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In unicode, the virama character is always used to form a consonant cluster. So स्की was written as &amp;lt;स,  ्, क,  ी&amp;gt;, or &amp;lt;sa, virama, ka, i&amp;gt;. If the font supports the cluster, it will show up as a ligature, otherwise it will use an explicit virama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Devanagari and Bengali, &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt;, in a consonant cluster the first consonant is munged a bit and the second consonant stays intact. There are exceptions – sometimes they’ll form an entirely new glyph (क + ष = क्ष), and sometimes both glyphs will change (ड + ड = ड्ड, द + म = द्म, द + ब = द्ब). Those last ones should look like this in conjunct form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;https://manishearth.github.io/images/post/unicode-crash/conjuncts.png&quot; width=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Investigating the Bengali case&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, interestingly, unlike the Telugu crash, the Bengali crash seemed to only occur when the second consonant is র (“ro”). However, I can trigger it for any choice of the first consonant or vowel, except when the vowel is  ৌ (au).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, র is an interesting consonant in some Indic scripts, including Devanagari. In Devanagari, it looks like र (“ra”). However, it does all kinds of things when forming a cluster. If you’re having it precede another consonant in a cluster, it forms a little feather-like stroke, like in र्क (rka). In Marathi, that stroke can also look like a tusk, as in र्‍क. As a suffix consonant, it can provide a little “extra leg”, as in क्र (kra). For letters without a vertical stroke, like ठ (tha), it does this caret-like thing, ठ्र (thra).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, while most consonants retain some of their form when put inside a cluster, र does not. And a more special thing about र is that this happens even when र is the &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; consonant in a cluster – as I mentioned before, for most consonant clusters the second consonant stays intact. While there are exceptions, they are usually specific to the cluster; it is only र for which this happens for all clusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s similar in Bengali, র as the second consonant adds a tentacle-like thing on the existing consonant. For example, প + র (po + ro) gives প্র (pro).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just র that does this in Bengali, the consonant “jo” does as well. প + য (po + jo) forms প্য (pjo), and the য is transformed into a wavy line called a “jophola”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I tried it with য — , and it turns out that the Bengali crash occurs for য as well! So the general Bengali case is &amp;lt;consonant, virama, র OR য, ZWNJ, vowel&amp;gt;, where the vowel is not  ৌ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Suffix-joining consonants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we’re getting close, here. At least for Bengali, it occurs when the second consonant is such that it often combines with the first consonant without modifying its form much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, this is the case for Telugu as well! Consonant clusters in Telugu are usually formed by preserving the original consonant, and tacking the second consonant on below!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the original crashy string contains the cluster జ + ఞ, which looks like జ్ఞ. The first letter isn’t really modified, but the second is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this, we can guess that it will also occur for Devanagari with र. Indeed it does! U+0915 U+094D U+0930 U+200C U+093E, that is, &amp;lt;क,  ्, र, zwnj, ा&amp;gt; (&amp;lt; ka, virama, ra, zwnj, aa &amp;gt;) is one such crashing sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this isn’t really the whole story, is it? For example, the crash does occur for “kro” + zwnj + vowel in Bengali, and in “kro” (ক্র = ক + র = ko + ro) the resultant cluster involves the munging of both the prefix and suffix. But the crash doesn’t occur for द्ब or ड्ड. It seems to be specific to the letter, not the nature of the cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digging deeper, the reason is that for many fonts (presumably the ones in use), these consonants form “suffix joining consonants” (a term I made up) when preceded by a virama&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the sequence virama + क gives   ्क, i.e. it renders a virama with a placeholder followed by a क.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, for र, virama + र renders  ्र, which for me looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;https://manishearth.github.io/images/post/unicode-crash/virama-ra.png&quot; width=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, this is the case for the other consonants as well. For me,  ्र  ্র  ্য  ్ఞ  ్క (Devanagari virama-ra, Bengali virama-ro, Bengali virama-jo, Telugu virama-nya, Telugu virama-ka) all render as “suffix joining consonants”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;https://manishearth.github.io/images/post/unicode-crash/virama-consonant.png&quot; width=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This is true for all Telugu consonants, not just the ones listed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kannada &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; has “suffix joining consonants”, but for some reason I cannot trigger the crash with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The ZWNJ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ZWNJ is curious. The crash doesn’t happen without it, but as I mentioned before a ZWNJ before a vowel doesn’t really &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; anything for most Indic scripts. In Indic scripts, a ZWNJ can be used to explicitly force a virama if used after the virama (I used it to write स्‌की in this post), however that’s not how it’s being used here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bengali and Oriya specifically, a ZWNJ can be used to force a different vowel form when used before a vowel (e.g. রু vs র‌ু), however this bug seems to apply to vowels for which there is only one form, and this bug also applies to other scripts where this isn’t the case anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Generalizing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, ultimately, the full set of cases that cause the crash are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any sequence &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;consonant1, virama, consonant2, ZWNJ, vowel&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in Devanagari, Bengali, and Telugu, where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;consonant2&lt;/code&gt; is suffix-joining – i.e. र, র, য, and all Telugu consonants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;vowel&lt;/code&gt; is not  ై or  ৌ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This leaves some questions open:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why doesn’t it apply to Kannada? Or, for that matter, Khmer, which has a similar virama-like thing called a “coeng”. What’s up with the exception vowels in Bengali and Telugu?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t really have &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; guess as to what’s going on here – I’d love to see what people think – but my current guess is that the “affinity” of the virama to the left instead of the right confuses the algorithm that handles ZWNJs after viramas into thinking the ZWNJ applies to the virama (it doesn’t, there’s a consonant in between), and this leads to some numbers not matching up and causing a buffer overflow or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting thing is that I can cause this crash to happen more reliably in browsers by clicking on the string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt; it actually renders in spotlight for a split second before crashing; which means that either the crash isn’t deterministic, or it occurs in some process &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; rendering. I’m not sure what to think of either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d love to hear if folks have further insight into this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Yes, I could attach a debugger to the crashing process and investigate that instead, but that’s no fun 😂&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Hey Microsoft, Stop Installing Apps on My PC Without Asking</title>
<link>https://www.howtogeek.com/342871/hey-microsoft-stop-installing-apps-on-my-pc-without-asking/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.howtogeek.com/342871/hey-microsoft-stop-installing-apps-on-my-pc-without-asking/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-342872&quot; data-pagespeed-lazy-src=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ximg_5a834e83ca2de.png.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+ws+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic.Nwi3w5qHlR.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif&quot; onload=&quot;pagespeed.lazyLoadImages.loadIfVisibleAndMaybeBeacon(this);&quot; onerror=&quot;this.onerror=null;pagespeed.lazyLoadImages.loadIfVisibleAndMaybeBeacon(this);&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m getting sick of Windows 10’s auto-installing apps. Apps like Facebook are now showing up out of nowhere, and even displaying notifications begging for me to use them. I didn’t install the Facebook app, I didn’t give it permission to show notifications, and I’ve never even used it. So why is it bugging me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows 10 has always been a little annoying about these apps, but it wasn’t always this bad. Microsoft went from “we pinned a few tiles, but the apps aren’t installed until you click them” to “the apps are now automatically installed on your PC” to “the automatically installed apps are now sending you notifications”. It’s ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The “Microsoft Consumer Experience” Is Consumer-Hostile…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/259946/how-to-get-rid-of-suggested-apps-in-windows-10/&quot;&gt;“Microsoft Consumer Experience” program&lt;/a&gt;, which can’t be disabled on normal Windows 10 Home or Professional systems. That’s why every Windows 10 computer you start using has these bonus apps. The exact apps preinstalled can vary, but I’ve never seen a Windows 10 PC without Candy Crush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft Consumer Experience is actually a background task that runs whenever you sign into a Windows 10 PC with a new user account for the first time. It kicks into gear and automatically downloads apps like Candy Crush Soda Saga, FarmVille 2: Country Escape, Facebook, TripAdvisor, and whatever else Microsoft feels like promoting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can uninstall the apps from your Start menu, and they shouldn’t come back on your user account the same hardware. However, the apps will also come back whenever you sign into a new PC with the same Microsoft account, forcing you to remove them on each device you use. And, if someone signs into your same PC with their own Microsoft account, Microsoft will “helpfully” download those apps for their account as well. There’s no way to tell Microsoft “stop downloading these apps on my PC” or “I never want these apps on this Microsoft account”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;…and Microsoft Won’t Let Us Disable It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, technically, a way to disable this and stop Windows from installing these apps…but it’s only for Windows 10 Enterprise and Education users. Even if you spent $200 for a Windows 10 Professional license because you want to use your PC for business, Microsoft won’t let you stop the “Consumer Experience” on a professional PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group policy or registry setting that disables this feature originally worked on Windows 10 Home and Professional in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/232176/whats-new-in-windows-10s-first-big-update-the-windows-10-fall-update/&quot;&gt;November 2015 update&lt;/a&gt; when Microsoft originally added the Consumer Experience. But Microsoft went out of their way to make Home and Professional ignore this setting in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/248177/whats-new-in-windows-10s-anniversary-update/&quot;&gt;Anniversary Update&lt;/a&gt;. Now, only Enterprise and Education respect that preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;These Apps Shouldn’t Be Able to Send Notifications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-342879&quot; data-pagespeed-lazy-src=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ximg_5a83578648a5f.png.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+ws+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic.XidRhAP2t5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif&quot; onload=&quot;pagespeed.lazyLoadImages.loadIfVisibleAndMaybeBeacon(this);&quot; onerror=&quot;this.onerror=null;pagespeed.lazyLoadImages.loadIfVisibleAndMaybeBeacon(this);&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s one thing for Microsoft to say “those apps just use a tiny bit of space, so what’s the harm?” But when the apps are installed by default and begin nagging you with advertisements (I mean notifications), it’s just too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This demonstrates a deeper problem with Windows 10’s app permission system, too. All apps get permission to show you notifications without asking you, even if Microsoft installed them on your PC against your wishes. You can disable notifications for an individual app, but all apps get permission to send them when they’re installed. On an iPhone or iPad, apps don’t get permission to show you notifications until they ask you nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe Microsoft’s permissions system would make sense if they Windows 10 didn’t automatically install apps on our PCs. But, since Microsoft is going to force these apps on us, the least they could do is make them ask before sending notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft Bundled a Password Manager Whose Browser Extension Was Insecure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has even caused some problems for users with this feature. Microsoft previously bundled the “Keeper” password manager with Windows 10, which prompted users to install a browser plugin. That plugin &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/12/microsoft-is-forcing-users-to-install-a-critically-flawed-password-manager/&quot;&gt;had a bug&lt;/a&gt; that resulted in “a complete compromise of Keeper security, allowing any website to steal any password”, according to Google security researcher Tavis Ormandy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security flaw wasn’t actually in the Keeper app Microsoft installed, but in the Keeper browser extension it asked you to install. In theory, almost everyone who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/141500/why-you-should-use-a-password-manager-and-how-to-get-started/&quot;&gt;uses a password manager&lt;/a&gt; would likely install its corresponding browser extension, since that’s what makes password managers useful. Look, we get it: bugs happen, and Keeper has since patched the hole. But this story demonstrated how Microsoft is pushing products it isn’t responsible for, and that isn’t a great thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much due diligence does Microsoft perform on the apps it chooses to install on users’ PCs? We really don’t know, as Microsoft won’t say what standards it holds these apps to or why it makes decisions to install the ones it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Please, Microsoft: Just Let Us Disable the “Consumer Experience”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-342880&quot; data-pagespeed-lazy-src=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ximg_5a8358171a73e.png.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+ws+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic.XWQYxDEfuZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif&quot; onload=&quot;pagespeed.lazyLoadImages.loadIfVisibleAndMaybeBeacon(this);&quot; onerror=&quot;this.onerror=null;pagespeed.lazyLoadImages.loadIfVisibleAndMaybeBeacon(this);&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These preinstalled apps are just one part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/269331/how-to-disable-all-of-windows-10s-built-in-advertising/&quot;&gt;the mess of advertising in Windows 10&lt;/a&gt;, but they feel worse somehow. Microsoft isn’t even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/267369/how-to-disable-notifications-in-windows-file-explorer/&quot;&gt;advertising their own products&lt;/a&gt;—they’re advertising other companies’ applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear what back-scratching is going on here. Are companies like Facebook, King (makers of Candy Crush), and Zynga (makers of FarmVille) paying Microsoft for this privilege? Or is Microsoft is so desperate for apps in the Windows Store that they promise to force apps on users’ PCs, if only companies will make them first?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either situation is bad. Microsoft should at least give Windows users a way to disable this “feature”, if not end the entire Microsoft Consumer Experience program entirely for the good of its customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, even if Microsoft makes no other change, they should at least remove notification permissions from these automatically installed apps. Come on, Microsoft. This is all just one step too far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td readability=&quot;24.621653084983&quot;&gt;Hi — we’re Chandan and Jon, co-founders of CoinTracker (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cointracker.io&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.cointracker.io&lt;/a&gt;). CoinTracker is a cryptocurrency portfolio manager that automatically pulls balances and transactions from top exchanges and wallets, and delivers tax information to users.
&lt;p&gt;We built CoinTracker because, as cryptocurrency investors, we were let down by the existing tools for basic performance tracking of our investments. We started by simply creating a spreadsheet that enabled manual entry of transactions, and eventually hacked away with Google Apps scripts to import prices from various exchanges. This quickly got out of hand, so we built our own tool. We casually told a few friends who are into cryptocurrency about it. They found it as useful as we did, and to our surprise started telling their friends about it. We started receiving a steady stream of feature requests, and since then we have been steadily improving CoinTracker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of CoinTracker’s foundational aspects is that balances and transactions are automatically synced from exchanges and cryptocurrency wallets. Before CoinTracker, we hated the idea of manually entering every transaction into a tool. This approach also enables us to calculate cost basis, ROI, capital gains, and other tax-related information for you. There are technical challenges of ensuring that we correctly handle transfers between your wallets and transitively handle cost basis — something that a lot of other tools struggle to do correctly. We think this direction is enabling us to build the best cryptocurrency portfolio tracker with important services like taxes built on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd love to get feedback from the HN community on CoinTracker and how we can improve. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share this story&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dominant idea about how cancer gets started is called the &quot;two-hit hypothesis.&quot; First proposed by Alfred Knudson in 1971, it holds that a cancer starts when one cell gets a mutation in both of its copies of a gene that normally blocks cancer formation (two hits). These two mutations disable the tumor-suppressing function in that cell, which then becomes cancerous. Eventually, the idea was expanded to include two hits not necessarily in the same gene but, rather, in genes controlling the same tumor-suppressing pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a new idea is challenging the two-hit hypothesis, shifting the focus to the role of the immune system in suppressing cancers. It's an idea that could have big implications for treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taking a hit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting two hits in one cell was considered to be a random and unlucky event. Since mutations occur each time a cell divides, the more times each cell divides, the greater the chances that it would happen. This was why, it was thought, cancer incidence increases with age; the longer a cell has been around, and the more times it has divided, the more opportunities it has had to accrue the two requisite mutations in the same tumor-suppressor pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence for the two-hit hypothesis came primarily from children with retinoblastoma, who have a germline mutation in the RB1 gene (named for the disease it causes) and are therefore born with one hit in every cell already. These kids usually end up with tumors in their eyes by the time they turn five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personalized medicine has been focused on the two-hit model. The idea is to identify the key mutations in a given cancer, then target and nullify them. It has been touted as the wave of the future for a while, but its successes have been mixed. Not every cancer has an obvious target gene, and many tumors can evolve resistance to targeted drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunotherapy, by contrast, has achieved some striking successes. Much of it relies on engineered T cells designed and synthesized to kill specific tumor cells. But it also involves awakening the body's existing T cells, which would go on to help fight the tumor. Tumors generally have proteins on their surface that can activate T cells, but they also have mechanisms to suppress the immune system. Cancer immunotherapy relieves this suppression, freeing the T cells to fight the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Immunity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new analysis suggests that the relationship between the immune system and tumor cells provides not only the basis for this new therapeutic approach but also the explanation for increased cancer incidence as we age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T cells arise in the thymus (that’s why they’re called T cells), but the thymus starts to atrophy around the time we turn one and the number of viable T cells it churns out drops continually over time. Mathematical modeling suggests that cancers do not primarily arise because getting two hits in one cell becomes more likely as we age. Instead, cancer-causing mutations seem to occur at roughly the same rate over the course of our lives, but our T cells wipe out these proto-cancer cells before they become clinically problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is only as our reservoir of T cells declines as we age that one of these continuously produced cancer cells can overcome immune surveillance and blossom into disease. The same immune system decline would explain the rising incidence of infectious diseases with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors cite a couple of observations supporting their model. One is that women get fewer cancers than men, since they have more circulating T cells and their T cell levels drop at lower rates. Another is that sharks, which have notoriously low cancer rates, do not experience this thymic atrophy as they age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also make a few practical recommendations. Nine out of ten of the cancers that best fit this new model have rates that spike in the late fifties, so they suggest that this might be a good age for more stringent cancer screening. And especially given the success that immunotherapies have already had in fighting some types of cancers, they suggest that more therapies that shore up T cell production or alleviate T cell exhaustion might be a better bet than trying to counteract or even prevent specific cancer-causing mutations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to emphasize that the two models aren't completely exclusive—mutations are still important for a cancer's development and progression, and they can still be targeted with treatments. The new proposal just drives home that, even if a cell picks up damaging mutations, it won't go on to form a cancer if the immune system kills it.&lt;/p&gt;

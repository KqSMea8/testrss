<title>Sex and STEM: Stubborn Facts and Stubborn Ideologies</title>
<link>http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Many academics in the modern world seem obsessed with the sex difference in engagement with science, technology, mathematics, and engineering (STEM) fields. Or rather they are obsessed with the fact that there are more men than women in some of these fields. There is particular concern about the lack of women in prestigious STEM fields, such as Ph.D.-level faculty positions, but surprisingly there is no concern about the under-representation of women in lower-level technical jobs, such as car mechanics or plumbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concerned academics have been especially effective in convincing others, or at least intimidating them, into accepting their preferred interpretations regarding the source of these sex differences (as illustrated in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40859004&quot;&gt;Google memo debate&lt;/a&gt;). These interpretations are not surprising and they include sexism, stereotype threat, and more recently implicit bias and microaggression. Each of these ideas has gained traction in the mainstream media and in many academic circles but their scientific foundations are shaky. In this essay, we’ll provide some background on the STEM controversy and consider multiple factors that might contribute to these sex differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. National Science Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17310/data.cfm&quot;&gt;reports that&lt;/a&gt; women are awarded 57 percent of undergraduate STEM degrees, but with substantial differences across fields. Women earn the majority of degrees in the life and social sciences but less than 20 percent of the degrees in computer science and engineering, sex differences that have held steady for several decades. The STEM debate is primarily about sex differences in educational and later occupational choices in inorganic fields, those focused on understanding non-living things. These differences are socially important because these tend to be prestigious occupations, and practically important because the different numbers of men and women in these fields contribute, in part, to the sex difference in earnings.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn1&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_78957&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-78957 size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/d24fkeqntp1r7r.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/28042707/Melba_Roy_-_Female_Computer_-_GPN-2000-001647-268x300.jpg?resize=268%2C300&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;268&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; srcset=&quot;http://d24fkeqntp1r7r.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/28042707/Melba_Roy_-_Female_Computer_-_GPN-2000-001647.jpg 268w, http://d24fkeqntp1r7r.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/28042707/Melba_Roy_-_Female_Computer_-_GPN-2000-001647.jpg 428w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 268px) 100vw, 268px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Melba Roy at NASA, 1964&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core of the obsession is the zeitgeist that there should be gender equity – equal &lt;em&gt;outcomes&lt;/em&gt; – for anything of monetary or social value. The combination of an extreme agenda among some feminists and a stubborn sex difference has created a cottage industry focused on rectifying this ‘injustice.’ The federal governments in the U.S., U.K., and other Western nations have devoted hundreds of millions of dollars to interventions to close the gap. Some of the activities funded by these initiatives make sense and are possibly helpful in some ways, such as programs to increase interest in mathematics or programming among girls. Other programs, such as developing mentoring programs exclusively for women who are junior faculty in science and engineering in university settings (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ecu.ac.uk/equality-charters/athena-swan/&quot;&gt;U.K. Athena Swan&lt;/a&gt;’s programs) are ethically problematic because they assume men do not need that level of support. From an evidence-based perspective, the most questionable and perhaps the most favored of these interventions are focused on stereotype threat, implicit bias, and microaggression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stereotype threat occurs when one is confronted with tasks or situations that trigger negative stereotypes (e.g., that “women are not as proficient at math as men”), that in turn result in a preoccupation about performing in a way that confirms the stereotype.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn2&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Critically, the preoccupation is said to undermine actual performance, even when there is no factual basis to the stereotype. Implicit bias is a related concept and involves an unconscious association between group membership (e.g., sex) and stereotypical positive or negative attributes that can also, in theory, result in prejudicial behavior towards individuals within that group.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn3&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Microaggressions are subtle behaviors (e.g., facial expressions) or statements that are not explicitly hostile but are nevertheless interpreted by the receiver as conveying contempt, stereotypical attitudes, or other negative beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of these theories and their activist followers believe that some significant proportion of the sex differences in STEM fields – but curiously only those in which men outnumber women – are thought to be caused by pervasive negative stereotypes about women’s abilities in these fields that in turn undermine their performance. Their argument is that in school and in the workplace, women in these fields are subjected to microaggressions by teachers and colleagues that seep from their unconscious belief in these same stereotypes. The result is the creation of unsupportive and even subtly hostile classrooms and work environments. These types of explanations fit hand-in-glove with the narrative of some feminist scholars; that the sex difference is largely due to oppressive social and cultural factors that undermine women’s pursuit of degrees and occupations in STEM fields.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn4&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These concepts have been embraced by the mass media and beyond, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/27/us/tutors-see-stereotypes-and-gender-bias-in-sat-testers-see-none-of-the-above.html?_r=1&quot;&gt;include accusations&lt;/a&gt; made in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; that the wording of several SAT items trigger stereotype threat and undermine girls’ performance on the mathematics section of the test, and the publication of self-help books to purge one’s own unconscious biases.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn5&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; On the face of it, there is nothing wrong with an academic and mass media focus on these topics. The real issues concern the magnitude of these effects on women’s STEM participation and the foregone opportunities of not focusing on other factors that might have an even stronger impact on their participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the magnitude of stereotype threat on girls’ and women’s mathematics achievement.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn6&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Given the prominence of the topic and the resources devoted to it, we carried out the first meta-analysis (i.e., statistical aggregation of experimental results across many studies) of the effect of stereotype threat on sex differences in mathematics performance.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn7&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We reasoned that if stereotype threat had a substantive effect on girls’ and women’s mathematics performance then the most basic experimental manipulation of the effect should replicate across studies. It replicated in about half of the studies that used the same and most basic experimental design. And of the half that replicated, half of these used a questionable statistical approach. The summary of the other half did not show a stereotype threat effect. Thus, if you accept the questionable statistical approach, you may still argue that a small stereotype threat exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a related analysis, Flore and Wichert found a similar overall effect, but when they corrected for publication bias – the tendency for positive but not negative results to be published – the effect essentially disappeared.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn8&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Because studies that do not find an effect tend not to get published, this means that even when there is evidence for a small stereotype threat effect in some reports, the real-world impact could be close to zero. Currently, a large replication effort is being carried out, and we are optimistic that this will be a significant step towards finally determining whether or not stereotype threat can undermine girl’s and women’s performance in mathematics, and if so to what extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, we see publication bias *for* studies demonstrating stereotype threat &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/5GQZhhWcI4&quot;&gt;https://t.co/5GQZhhWcI4&lt;/a&gt; and linking videogames to aggression &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/269x4guF71&quot;&gt;https://t.co/269x4guF71&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychology tells us a lot… about how psychologists want the world to be!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Steve Stewart-Williams (@SteveStuWill) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SteveStuWill/status/956451626486607872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 25, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted, though, that the largest study to date included nearly 1000 children (9-14 years old) and found no effects.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn9&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This latter study is of particular interest, because it included adolescents, whereas most other stereotype threat studies were carried out with university students. If stereotype threat discourages girls from pursuing math-intensive STEM coursework and careers, its effect should be evident in high-school. The fact that a large and well-designed study could not find any effect, in our opinion, suggests either the effect does not exist or it is unmeasurably small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, the existing evidence indicates that stereotype threat has received outsized attention from educational policy makers and opinion makers. Thus, the considerable efforts at addressing this ‘problem’ will almost certainly have little if any effect on girls’ and women’s participation in inorganic STEM fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We suspect the same is true for implicit bias. For a variety of cultural and legal reasons, the level of explicit sexism has dropped considerably over the years in most school and work environments. But, as noted, girls’ interest and women’s participation in inorganic STEM fields has remained stubbornly low.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn6&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So, there is now a fork in the road. Down one path is the conclusion that explicit sexism is no longer keeping girls and women away from these fields and so something other than sexism or bias must going on, as we’ll discuss below. The other path maintains the conceptual grasp on sexism but switches focus to an ‘unconscious’ and subtle form of sexism that results from implicit bias and its behavioral companion, microaggression.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn10&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref10&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that most academics and the general public have wandered down this second path. Indeed, implicit bias has achieved a cult-like status in some academic circles and in the wider culture. There are now &lt;a href=&quot;https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/&quot;&gt;on-line tests&lt;/a&gt; to assess one’s implicit bias in a number of areas, including sex differences in work and family. We are not doubting that people have all sorts of implicit beliefs that may or may not be accurate. At issue here is whether or not we can rigorously and accurately assess these biases, and whether or not the strength of any such biases is sufficient to explain the sex differences in STEM fields. The assessment of implicit bias is often done using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/user/agg/blindspot/indexgc.htm&quot;&gt;implicit associations test&lt;/a&gt;, whereby the strength of people’s associations between sex and certain attributes, such as work or science, is assessed by a series of categorization tasks. The difference between the speed of categorizing certain attributes (e.g., scientist, engineer) to one sex or the other is taken as an index of implicit bias. Nosek and colleagues found that people are generally quicker to associate men with science and women with literature, which is taken as an implicit bias against women in science, although they do concede that their results may reflect people’s knowledge of actual occupational sex differences.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn11&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref11&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it doesn’t typically reach the ears of the general public, there is vigorous debate within the scientific community regarding what exactly is being measured by implicit bias tests, and whether they actually influence behavior.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn12&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref12&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn13&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref13&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;Even if the tests are measuring bias, the influence on actual behavior is small at best, although proponents argue that these small effects add up over time.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn14&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref14&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The ways in which implicit attitudes are thought to influence real-world outcomes include promoting stereotype threat and microaggressions.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn15&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref15&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As we noted above for stereotype threat, there are serious concerns about the ability to accurately measure microaggressions, whether or not they are related to implicit bias at all, and – if it is indeed a valid concept – whether or not ‘victims’ suffer long-term consequences.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn16&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref16&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;These issues have not stopped the development of yet another rent-seeking industry to put a stop to this ‘aggression’ on college campuses, in the workplace, and in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We suspect that concepts like stereotype threat, implicit bias, and microaggression have gained traction because they fit the inequalities-equals-oppression narrative.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn17&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref17&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In many cases, explicit oppression is hard to find in classrooms and the workplace and, thus, the resort to explanations from unconscious bias and fleeting behaviors (microaggressions) that continually ‘assault’ and undermine the ‘victim.’ In this case, the victims are girls’ and women’s aspirations towards and performance in certain STEM fields, especially engineering, computer science, and the physical sciences. The logical response to this narrative is the development of interventions to reduce stereotype threat, implicit bias, and microaggressions. But, what if these factors have much smaller effects on girls and women than proponents argue?  The associated time and resources devoted to addressing these problems will have little or no long-term effect on girls’ interest in or women’s participation in inorganic STEM fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If not implicit and subtle oppression, then what’s really going on? &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve recently found that countries renowned for gender equality show some of the largest sex differences in interest in and pursuit of STEM degrees, which is not only inconsistent with an oppression narrative, it is positive evidence against it.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn18&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref18&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Consider that Finland excels in gender equality, its adolescent girls outperform boys in science, and it ranks near the top in European educational performance.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn19&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref19&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; With these high levels of educational performance and overall gender equality, Finland is poised to close the sex differences gap in STEM. Yet, Finland has one of the world’s largest sex differences in college degrees in STEM fields. Norway and Sweden, also leading in gender equality rankings, are not far behind. This is only the tip of the iceberg, as this general pattern of increasing sex differences with national increases in gender equality is found throughout the world.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn20&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref20&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent uptick in interest in concepts such as stereotype threat, implicit bias, and microaggression may be a reaction to the low female STEM participation in highly developed nations. At one time, there were substantive social and educational impediments to women’s participation in these (and other) fields, but as explicit sexism and restricted educational opportunities faded into history, the sex differences (e.g., fewer women than men physicists) attributed to them should have faded as well. Some of them have even reversed, such that more women than men attend and graduate from college and women may now have structural advantages (e.g., hiring practices) in STEM fields.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn21&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref21&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Even with these changes, many other sex differences remain or have become larger over time. The latter are serious problems for anyone with strong beliefs about purely or largely social influences on sex differences; if the obvious social causes have been addressed, then there must be other, more subtle oppressive factors afoot. This is where stereotype threat, implicit bias, microaggression and related concepts enter the oppression narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that with economic development and advances in human rights, including gender equality, people are better able to pursue their individual interests and in doing so more basic sex differences are more fully expressed.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn22&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref22&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The differences in STEM are related in part to student’s personal and occupational interests and relative academic strengths. Sex differences in occupational interests are large, well-documented, and reflect a more basic sex difference in interest in things versus people.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn23&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref23&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Men prefer occupations that involve working with things (e.g., engineering, mechanics) and abstract ideas (e.g., scientific theory) and women prefer working with and directly contributing to the wellbeing of others (e.g., physician, teacher). The sex difference in interest in people extends to a more general interest in living things, which would explain why women who are interested in science are much more likely to pursue a career in biology or veterinary medicine than computer science.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn24&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref24&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programs designed to steer women into inorganic STEM fields would in effect steer these same women away from the life sciences. Such programs would, in our opinion, only be justifiable if women are not provided a fair opportunity to pursue inorganic STEM fields (for which there is no good evidence). The main argument from gender activists is that inorganic STEM fields are a better choice for women either because these jobs lead to higher incomes or that there is a labor market demand for them. Both arguments are fundamentally capitalist and dehumanizing in the sense that considerations of personal interest are overridden by considerations of societal demand. This is ironic, given that the agenda arguing for more women in STEM seems most popular among left-leaning people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, on top of differences in career preferences, there are important and largely overlooked sex differences in relative strengths in reading, mathematics, and science.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn25&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref25&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Students who are relatively better in reading-related areas (e.g., literature) than they are in science or mathematics, &lt;em&gt;independent&lt;/em&gt; of their absolute level of performance are more likely to pursue college degrees in the humanities and enter non-science occupations. The reverse is true for students who are relatively better in science and mathematics than literature.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn26&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref26&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This is where the results from Finland and elsewhere make sense. Although Finnish girls perform as well or better than Finnish boys in science, the gap is even larger in reading. The result is that more Finnish girls have relative advantages in reading than science. Most adolescent boys in contrast are relatively better at science or mathematics than reading, independent of their absolute level of performance. Individuals with this academic profile are likely to enter STEM areas, either as research scientists or technicians, and there are more boys than girls with this pattern throughout the world.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quillette.com/2018/02/15/sex-stem-stubborn-facts-stubborn-ideologies/#_ftn25&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that the sex difference in academic strengths explains part of the gap between the proportion of adolescent girls who have the absolute level of science and mathematical competencies needed to pursue a STEM degree in college and the proportion that actually obtain such a degree. The other contributing factor is their stated interest in and enjoyment of science. At the same time, there was still a gap between the number of women capable of obtaining a STEM degree and those that actually completed one. There was no sex difference in the math and science abilities needed to pursue a STEM degree. This leaves some room for stereotype threat, implicit bias, or related factors, but their relative contribution (assuming they exist) would be small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better route to increasing women’s participation in STEM might be to focus on the substantive numbers of girls with relatively higher science or mathematics than reading achievement; 24 percent of Finnish girls, for instance. These girls have the academic profile that is common in boys that pursue STEM-related careers but fewer of these girls than boys actually pursue them. It seems to us that interventions focused on this group of girls (e.g., individual mentoring) holds much more promise for increasing the number of women in inorganic STEM professions than do currently vogue interventions that focus on purging the wider society of stereotypes, implicit bias, and microaggressions.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Sex and STEM: Stubborn Facts and Stubborn Ideologies - Quillette</og:title>
<og:description>Many academics in the modern world seem obsessed with the sex difference in engagement with science, technology, mathematics, and engineering (STEM) fields. Or rather they are obsessed with the fact that there are more men than women in some of these fields. There is particular concern about the lack of women in prestigious STEM fields, such as Ph.D.-level faculty positions, but surprisingly there is no concern about the under-representation of women in lower-level technical jobs, such as car mechanics or plumbing. The concerned academics have been especially effective in convincing others, or at least intimidating them, into accepting their preferred interpretations regarding the source of these sex differences (as illustrated in the Google memo debate). These interpretations are not surprising and they include sexism, stereotype threat, and more recently implicit bias and microaggression. Each of these ideas has gained traction in the mainstream media and in many academic circles but their scientific foundations are shaky. In this essay, we’ll provide some background on the STEM controversy and consider multiple factors that might contribute to these …</og:description>

<title>Email is your electronic memory</title>
<link>https://blog.fastmail.com/2018/02/14/email-is-your-electronic-memory/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.fastmail.com/2018/02/14/email-is-your-electronic-memory/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;blog-author&quot;&gt;Bron Gondwana – 14 February 2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the CEO’s desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you write planned blog posts, sometimes events in the news are a prompt to re-examine your values. This is one of those second times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gmail and AMP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Google announced that Gmail will use AMP to make emails dynamic, up-to-date and actionable. At first that sounds like a great idea. Last week’s news is stale. Last week’s special offer from your favourite shop might not be on sale any more. The email is worthless to you now. Imagine if it could stay up-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TechCrunch &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/13/google-wants-to-use-amp-to-make-email-more-interactive/&quot;&gt;wrote about AMP in Gmail&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/author/devin-coldewey/&quot;&gt;one of their columnists&lt;/a&gt; wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/13/amp-for-email-is-a-terrible-idea/&quot;&gt;followup&lt;/a&gt; response about why it might not be a good idea – which led to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16372234&quot;&gt;lot of discussion&lt;/a&gt; on Hacker News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devin used the word static. In the past I have used the word &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fastmail.com/2014/12/05/security-integrity/&quot;&gt;immutable&lt;/a&gt;. I think “immutable” is more precise, though maybe less plain and simple language than “static” – because I don’t really care about how dynamic and interactive email becomes – usability is great, I’m all in favour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But unchanging-ness... that’s really important. In fact, it’s the key thing about email. It is the biggest thing that email has over social networking or any of the hosted chat systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An email which is just a wrapper for content pulled from a website is no longer an unchangeable copy of anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be totally honest, email already has a problem with mutability – an email which is just a wrapper around &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=email+remote+images&quot;&gt;remotely hosted images&lt;/a&gt; can already be created, though FastMail offers you the option of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com/help/receive/remotecontent.html&quot;&gt;turning them off or restricting them to senders in your address book&lt;/a&gt;. Most sites and email clients offer an option to block remote images by default, both for privacy and because they can change after being delivered (even more specifically, an email with remote images can totally change after being content scanned).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Your own memory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The email in your mailbox is &lt;strong&gt;your copy&lt;/strong&gt; of what was said, and nobody else can change it or make it go away. The fact that the content of an email can’t be edited is one of the best things about POP3 and IMAP email standards. I admit it annoyed me when I first ran into it – why can’t you just fix up a message in place – but the immutability is the real strength of email. You can safely forget the detail of something that you read in an email, knowing that when you go back to look at it, the information will be exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time your mailbox becomes an extension of your memory – a trusted repository of history, in the way that an &lt;a href=&quot;https://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/03/17/new-york-times-bernie-sanders-coverage-public-editor/&quot;&gt;online news site will never be&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of the underlying reasons, it is a fact that websites can be “corrected” after you read them, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politwoops.com/g/australia&quot;&gt;tweets can be deleted&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/34872506/facebook-censorship-had-a-post-removed-and-dont-know-why&quot;&gt;posts taken down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, often things are taken down or edited for good reasons. The problem is, you can read something online, forward somebody a link to it or just go back later to re-read it, and discover that the content has changed since you were last there. If you don’t have perfect memory (I sure don’t!) then you may not even be sure exactly what changed – just be left with a feeling that it’s not quite how you remember it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, email is not like that. Email is static, immutable, unchanging. That’s really important to me, and really important to FastMail. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fastmail.com/2016/12/13/fastmails-values/&quot;&gt;Our values&lt;/a&gt; are very clear – your data belongs to you, and we promise to be good stewards of your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to promise that FastMail will “never implement AMP” because compatibility is also important to our users, but we will proceed cautiously and skeptically on any changes that allow emails to mutate after you’ve seen them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An online datastore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we’re a hosted “cloud” service. If we turned bad, we could start silently changing your email. The best defence against any cloud service doing that is keeping your own copies, or at least digests of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from trusting us, and our multiple replicas and backups of every email, we make it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com/help/account/downloaddata.html&quot;&gt;very easy&lt;/a&gt; to keep your own copies of messages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;6.2385057471264&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0.95833333333333&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full standards-compliant access to email. You can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com/help/#clients&quot;&gt;IMAP or POP3&lt;/a&gt; to download messages. IMAP provides the triple of “foldername / uidvalidity / uid” as a unique key for every message. Likewise we provide CalDAV and CardDAV access to the raw copies of all your calendars and contacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3.7799352750809&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Export in useful formats. Multiple formats for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com/help/contacts/importexportcontacts.html#exportcontacts&quot;&gt;contacts&lt;/a&gt;. Standard ICS files for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com/help/calendar/importexportcalendars.html#exportcalendars&quot;&gt;calendars&lt;/a&gt; and it’s rather hidden, but at the bottom of the Folders screen, there’s a link called “Mass delete or remove duplicates” and there’s a facility on that screen to download entire folders as a zip file as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working towards new standards for email. Our team is working hard on &lt;a href=&quot;http://jmap.io/&quot;&gt;JMAP&lt;/a&gt; and will be participating in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ietf/meeting/wiki/101hackathon&quot;&gt;hackathon&lt;/a&gt; at IETF in London in March to test interoperability with other implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also provide a DIGEST.SHA1 non-standard fetch item via IMAP that allows you to fetch the SHA1 of any individual email. It’s not a standard though. We plan to offer something similar via JMAP, but for any attachment or sub-part of emails as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Your data, your choice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We strongly believe that our customers stay with us because we’re the best, not because it’s hard to leave. If for any reason you want to leave FastMail, we make it as easy as possible to migrate your email away. Because it’s all about trust – trust that we will keep your email confidential, trust that we will make your email easy to access, and trust that every email will be exactly the same, every time you come back to read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to our customers for choosing us, and staying with us. If you’re not our customer yet, please do grab yourself a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com/signup/&quot;&gt;free trial account&lt;/a&gt; and check out our product. Let us know via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com/support/&quot;&gt;support&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/FastMail&quot;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;, whether you decide to stay, and particuarly if you decide not to! The only thing we don’t want to hear is “it should be free” – we’re not interested in that discussion, we provide a good service and we proudly charge for it so that you are our customer, not our product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you’re not ready to move all your email, you can get a lot of the same features for a whole group of people using &lt;a href=&quot;https://topicbox.com/&quot;&gt;Topicbox&lt;/a&gt; – a shared memory without having to change anything except the “To:” line in the emails you send!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bron.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Utility poles</title>
<link>https://blog.plover.com/tech/utility-poles.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.plover.com/tech/utility-poles.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;storytitle&quot; name=&quot;utility-poles&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.plover.com/tech/utility-poles.html&quot;&gt;Utility poles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am almost always interested in utility infrastructure. I see it every day, and often don't think about it. The electric power distribution grid is a gigantic machine, one of the biggest devices ever built, and people spend their whole lives becoming experts on just one part of it. What is it all for, how does it work? What goes wrong, and how do you fix it? Who makes the parts, and how much do they cost? Every day I go outside and see things like these big cylinders:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pic.blog.plover.com/tech/utility-poles/transformers.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://pic.blog.plover.com/tech/utility-poles/transformers-th.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A wooden power utility pole, including cobra-head street light, with three large gray cylinders mounted on it under the main wires&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and I wonder what they are. In this case from clues in the environment I was able to guess they were electrical power transformers. Power is distributed on these poles at about seven thousand volts, which is called “medium voltage”. But you do not want 7000-volt power in your house because it would come squirting out of the electric outlets in awesome lightnings and burn everything up. Also most household uses do not want three-phase power, they want single-phase power. So between the pole and the house there is a transformer to change the shape of the electricity to 120V, and that's what these things are. They turn out to be called “distribution transformers” and they are manufactured by — guess who? — General Electric, and they cost a few thousand bucks each. And because of the Wonders of the Internet, I can find out quite a lot about them. The cans are full of mineral oil, or sometimes vegetable oil! (Why are they full of oil? I don't know; I guess for insulation. But I could probably find out.) There are three because that is one way to change the three-phase power to single-phase, something I wish I understood better. Truly, we live in an age of marvels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I was having dinner with a friend recently and for some reason we got to talking about the ID plates on utility poles. The poles around here all carry ID numbers, and I imagine that back at the electric company there are giant books listing, for each pole ID number, where the pole is. Probably they computerized this back in the seventies, and the books are moldering in a closet somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I discussed recently, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.plover.com/tech/gompertz.html&quot;&gt;some of those poles are a hundred years old&lt;/a&gt;, and the style of the ID tags has changed over that time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pic.blog.plover.com/tech/utility-poles/pole-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://pic.blog.plover.com/tech/utility-poles/pole-2-th.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;An old, stamped-metal identification plate nailed to a wooden utility pole. The plate is elliptical, and says 'PHILA ELEC. Cº 79558 B'&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://pic.blog.plover.com/tech/utility-poles/pole-7.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://pic.blog.plover.com/tech/utility-poles/pole-7-th.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; wooden=&quot;&quot; pole=&quot;&quot; newer=&quot;&quot; identification=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; it.=&quot;&quot; this=&quot;&quot; is=&quot;&quot; a=&quot;&quot; rectangular=&quot;&quot; metal=&quot;&quot; frame.=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; frame=&quot;&quot; bright=&quot;&quot; yellow=&quot;&quot; tags=&quot;&quot; with=&quot;&quot; black=&quot;&quot; printed=&quot;&quot; numerals=&quot;&quot; reading=&quot;79557B'.&quot; under=&quot;&quot; the=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; tag=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; nailed=&quot;&quot; some=&quot;&quot; smaller=&quot;&quot; maintenance=&quot;&quot; record=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://pic.blog.plover.com/tech/utility-poles/pole-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://pic.blog.plover.com/tech/utility-poles/pole-1-th.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;This wooden pole has the following letters burned into it: 'BWR CPT 51017 SPSK6 250 PECO'&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks to me like the original style was those oval plates that you see on the left, and that at some point some of the plates started to wear out and were replaced by the yellow digit tags in the middle picture. The most recent poles don't have tags: the identifier is burnt into the pole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poles in my neighborhood tend to have consecutive numbers. I don't think this was carefully planned. I guess how this happened is: when they sent the poles out on the truck to be installed, they also sent out a bunch of ID plates, perhaps already attached to the poles, or perhaps to be attached onsite. The plates would already have the numbers on them, and when you grab a bunch of them out of the stack they will naturally tend to have consecutive numbers, as in the pictures above, because that's how they were manufactured. So the poles in a vicinity will tend to have numbers that are close together, until they don't, because at that point the truck had to go back for more poles. So although you might find poles 79518–79604 in my neighborhood, poles 79605–79923 might be in a completely different part of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on someone was inspecting pole 79557 (middle picture) and noticed that the number plate was wearing out. So they pried it off and replaced it with the yellow digit tag, which is much newer than the pole itself. The inspector will have a bunch of empty frames and a box full of digits, so they put up a new tag with the old ID number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometime more recently they switched to these new-style poles with numbers burnt into them at the factory, in a different format than before. I have tried to imagine what the number-burning device looks like, but I'm not at all sure. Is it like a heated printing press, or perhaps a sort of configurable branding iron? Or is it more like a big soldering iron that is on a computer-controlled axis and writes the numbers on like a pen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder what the old plates are made of. They have to last a long time. For a while I was puzzled. Steel would rust; and I thought even stainless steel wouldn't last as long as these tags need to. Aluminum is expensive. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_pest&quot;&gt;Tin degrades at low temperatures&lt;/a&gt;. But thanks to the Wonders of the Internet, I have learned that, properly made, stainless steel tags can indeed last long enough; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bssa.org.uk/&quot;&gt;the web site of the British Stainless Steel Association&lt;/a&gt; advises me that even in rough conditions, stainless steel with the right composition can last 85 years outdoors. I will do what I should have done in the first place, and go test the tags with a magnet to see if they are ferrous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's where some knucklehead in the Streets Department decided to nail a No Parking sign right over the ID tag:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pic.blog.plover.com/tech/utility-poles/pole-6.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://pic.blog.plover.com/tech/utility-poles/pole-6-th.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A close-up of an old oval tag just peeking out from behind the corner of the metal regulation sign that was nailed to the same pole&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing you can see on these poles is inspection tags:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pic.blog.plover.com/tech/utility-poles/pole-5.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://pic.blog.plover.com/tech/utility-poles/pole-5-th.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A very old pole. Three groups of tags are nailed to it. The bottom two groups contains an oval tag stamped with OSMOSE and an inspection year (2001 or 2013), and a quarter-circle tag stamped with MITC-FUME. The top group is missing its oval tag, and has only a rather rusty quarter-circle that says WOODFUME&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the Internet I would just have to wonder what these were and what OSMOSE meant. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.osmose.com/content/pages/about-osmose&quot;&gt;It is the name of the company&lt;/a&gt; that PECO has hired to inspect and maintain the poles. They specialize in this kind of work. This old pole was inspected in 2001 and again in 2013. The dated inspection tag from the previous inspection is lost but we can see a pie-shaped tag that says WOODFUME. You may recall from my previous article that the main killer of wood poles is fungal infection. Woodfume is an inexpensive fumigant that retards pole decay. It propagates into the pole and decomposes into MITC (methyl isothiocyanate). By 2001 PECO had switched to using MITC-FUME, which impregnates the pole directly with MITC. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.osmose.com/fumigants.100066.content&quot;&gt;Osmose will be glad to tell you all about it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Warning: Probably &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; 30% of the surmise in this article is wrong.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/category/facebook/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; is feeling lonely these days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The social media behemoth has seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/2018/01/31/facebook-earnings-2017-50-million-hours-per-day-traffic/&quot;&gt;a decline in traffic&lt;/a&gt; in recent weeks along with millions of users &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2018/2/12/16998750/facebooks-teen-users-decline-instagram-snap-emarketer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;leaving its platform&lt;/a&gt;, and it appears to be taking rather drastic measures to win them back. Specifically, spamming the hell out of them in a most unfortunate place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So says one account holder, Gabriel Lewis, who tweeted that Facebook texted &quot;spam&quot; to the phone number he submitted for the purposes of &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/2016/09/22/two-factor-authentication-hackers/&quot;&gt;2-factor authentication&lt;/a&gt;. And no, he insists &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Gabriel__Lewis/status/963795048247644160&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he did not&lt;/a&gt; have mobile notifications turned on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, when he replied &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;DO NOT TEXT ME,&quot; he says those message showed up on his Facebook wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;twitter-wrapper sort-rerender&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;6.5959183673469&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;7.4204081632653&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;So I signed up for 2 factor auth on Facebook and they used it as an opportunity to spam me notifications. Then they posted my replies on my wall. 🤦‍♂️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Fy44b07wNg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Fy44b07wNg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Gabriel Lewis 🦆 (@Gabriel__Lewis) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Gabriel__Lewis/status/963121814166630400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;February 12, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis explained his version of the story to Mashable via Twitter direct message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;[Recently] I decided to sign up for 2FA on all of my accounts including FaceBook, shortly afterwards they started sending me notifications from the same phone number. I never signed up for it and I don't even have the FB app on my phone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis further explained that he can go &quot;for months&quot; without signing into Facebook, which suggests the possibility that Mark Zuckerberg's creation was feeling a little neglected and trying to get him back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Lewis, he signed up for 2FA on Dec. 17 and the alleged spamming began on Jan. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; data-credit-name=&quot;Gabriel Lewis&quot; data-credit-provider=&quot;custom type&quot; data-caption=&quot;A screengrab showing when Lewis first signed up for 2FA on Facebook, and the beginning of the alleged spam.&quot; title=&quot;A screengrab showing when Lewis first signed up for 2FA on Facebook, and the beginning of the alleged spam.&quot; src=&quot;https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/iRUEnTo68zT4JTuwH6fwGIJy57U=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F714825%2F0a873b48-bf93-475e-a72b-49d9355b8520.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A screengrab showing when Lewis first signed up for 2FA on Facebook, and the beginning of the alleged spam.&quot; data-fragment=&quot;m!0ee3&quot; data-image=&quot;https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/XNC9-wx7fGAvYqsxtM37rpZX9IQ=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F714825%2F0a873b48-bf93-475e-a72b-49d9355b8520.jpg&quot; data-micro=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-credit&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reached out to Facebook to find out just what, exactly, is going on here. Is this some kind of bug? Perhaps a limited test? It's not really clear, as the comment offered from a company spokesperson didn't shed much light on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We give people control over their notifications, including those that relate to security features like two-factor authentication,&quot; noted the spokesperson. &quot;We’re looking into this situation to see if there’s more we can do to help people manage their communications.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, Lewis isn't the only person who claims this happened to him. One Facebook user says he accidentally told &quot;friends and family to go [to] hell&quot; when he &quot;replied to the spam.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;twitter-wrapper sort-rerender&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn't look good for for Facebook. &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/2017/11/03/zeynep-tufekci-facebook-social-media/&quot;&gt;Zeynep Tufekci&lt;/a&gt;, a self-described technosociologist, professor at UNC, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/2017/10/27/facebook-ads-algorithm-problem/&quot;&gt;frequent Facebook critic&lt;/a&gt;, voiced some particularly strong concerns.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as Lewis is concerned, Facebook attempts to woo him back have more or less backfired. &quot;I feel like they are constantly pushing me to come back to the service but this is not the way to do it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, no one likes a desperate ex. &lt;/p&gt;

<title>The FBI, CIA and NSA say American citizens shouldn&amp;#039;t use Huawei phones</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;cnnVidplayer&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;summaryImg&quot; id=&quot;vid0&quot; href=&quot;/video/technology/2017/06/16/cybersecurity-how-to-protect-yourself-from-hackers.cnnmoney&quot; onclick=&quot;javascript:VideoPlayerManager.playVideos('cvp_story_0'); return false;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/161220085719-russian-hacking-crime-1024x576.jpg&quot; width=&quot;780&quot; height=&quot;439&quot; alt=&quot;How to protect yourself from hackers&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;speakable&quot;&gt;U.S. intelligence agencies have issued a stern warning to Americans: Do not buy smartphones made by Chinese tech companies Huawei or ZTE.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;speakable&quot;&gt;Top officials from the CIA, NSA, FBI and the Defense Intelligence Agency &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.c-span.org/video/?440888-1/fbi-director-rob-porter-background-check-completed-july&amp;amp;start=7106&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;testified&lt;/a&gt; in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday that the Chinese smartphone makers posed a security threat to American customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;speakable&quot;&gt;Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas asked the group to raise their hands if they would recommend private American citizens use products or services made by Apple competitor Huawei or smartphone maker ZTE. None of them did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FBI Director Chris Wray explained why it is an issue for companies and local governments to use Huawei or ZTE products and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a risk of letting any company &quot;beholden to foreign governments&quot; inside the country's telecommunications infrastructure, he said. Huawei is a global leader in networking equipment, and the government has previously blocked it from selling technology to some federal agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/09/technology/huawei-att-smartphone-talks-collapse/index.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;inStoryHeading&quot;&gt;Related: Huawei fails to clinch smartphone deal with AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It provides the capacity to maliciously modify or steal information,&quot; Wray said. &quot;And it provides the capacity to conduct undetected espionage.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei has not made strides in the U.S. market in large part because of government concerns that the Chinese government can use its smartphones and other products for intelligence gathering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, Congress released &lt;a href=&quot;http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/08/congressional-report-u-s-should-view-with-suspicion-two-chinese-companies/?iid=EL&quot;&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; saying the two Chinese companies should be viewed &quot;with suspicion.&quot; The companies both &lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2012/10/08/technology/huawei-zte-congress/index.html&quot;&gt;strongly disputed&lt;/a&gt; the reports' findings at the time, with Huawei calling them &quot;baseless.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, talks between Huawei and AT&amp;amp;T to sell its smartphones &lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/09/technology/huawei-att-smartphone-talks-collapse/index.html&quot;&gt;fell through&lt;/a&gt;. On Tuesday, Wray praised the efforts of telecommunications providers that are trying to &quot;raise awareness on this issue.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei said in a statement Wednesday that it is &quot;monitoring developments&quot; in Congress, but it declined to comment directly on the intelligence committee hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company highlighted its strong position in many markets outside of the U.S. Its phones outsell Apple's in places like Central and Eastern Europe, according to research firm Canalys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We operate in 170 countries where there is trust with governments and customers. We pose no greater cybersecurity risk than other vendors,&quot; Huawei said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company insisted it &quot;has never been asked to provide access to our technology, or provide any data or information on any citizen or organization to any government, or their agencies.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/07/technology/zte-china-iran-sanctions/index.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;inStoryHeading&quot;&gt;Related: ZTE fined $1.2 billion for violating U.S. sanctions on Iran&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZTE said in a statement that its mobile phones and devices incorporate chipsets and other components manufactured in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;As a publicly traded company, we are committed to adhering to all applicable laws and regulations of the United States, work with carriers to pass strict testing protocols, and adhere to the highest business standards,&quot; a representative for ZTE said in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cotton &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cotton.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;amp;id=887&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; a bill last week that would prohibit the government from contracting with companies that use Huawei or ZTE products. It's a companion bill to the &quot;Defending U.S. Government Communications Act&quot; put forth in the House last month. In 2013, Congress passed a law that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cybersecurity-espionage/u-s-law-to-restrict-government-purchases-of-chinese-it-equipment-idUSBRE92Q18O20130327&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;prevented&lt;/a&gt; some federal agencies from buying tech from these firms without approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the latest push by Congress to prohibit foreign-made products due to intelligence concerns. For instance, the Russia-based Kaspersky Lab has been banned from federal computers.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Launch HN: SheerlyGenius (YC W18) – Indestructible Tights from Bulletproof Fiber</title>
<link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16377751</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16377751</guid>
<description>I’m Katherine Homuth and I founded Sheerly Genius - indestructible sheer tights made from bulletproof fibers. We just launched our product on Kickstarter (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.2e.go2.fund/tights&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.2e.go2.fund/tights&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;p&gt;Every year $8 billion dollars worth of sheer tights/pantyhose end up in the landfill after only one or two wears. Ripping sheers is as easy as accidentally catching them on a fingernail, or simply pulling too hard while putting them on. Our goal is to replace these disposable products with Sheerly Genius, which has been tested to last up to 50 wears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have been working on this for about 12 months so far and it has been quite an adventure. When I started out I didn’t think we’d be developing our own fiber and machines, but that’s what it ultimately took.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first fibers I looked at were aramids, like kevlar, which of course were attractive for their strength. To be considered sheer (as opposed to opaque), a pair of tights needs fibers that are 30 denier or less. Denier measures the thickness or fineness of a fiber. I quickly learned that the lowest denier kevlar came in was 1000 denier! So it was a non-starter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out that none of the fibers on the market today were both fine and strong enough to make an indestructible sheer product. Ultimately we had to develop our own fiber: a finer, colored version of the non-dyeable polyethylene fibers used in higher end bulletproof vests and climbing equipment. To use these fibers we had to retrofit circular knitting machines with new feeding systems and blades, because the fibers are so strong they break typical knitting machines!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My background is in software and manufacturing - building and selling two companies prior to Sheerly Genius. But this is my first journey into textiles. In my last startup I worked directly with many hardware companies, but became increasingly skeptical of the trend in IoT towards “connected” anything. One thing I love about this project is that we’ve been able to innovate in wearables without being connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun Fact: Half of our backers on Kickstarter so far have been men!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m looking forward to talking manufacturing, textiles, and crowdfunding. Can’t wait to hear your ideas and experiences in these areas. Also happy to answer any questions about our journey in developing the product so far!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>CSS Grid for UI Layouts</title>
<link>https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/02/css-grid-for-ui-layouts/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/02/css-grid-for-ui-layouts/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;CSS Grid is a great layout tool for content-driven websites that include long passages of text, and it has tremendous value for a variety of traditional UI layouts as well. In this article I’ll show you how to use CSS Grid to improve application layouts that need to respond and adapt to user interactions and changing conditions, and always have your panels scroll properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CSS Grid&lt;/a&gt; builds website layouts. It lets web designers create beautiful dynamic layouts using just a tiny bit of supported code instead of the endless float hacks we’ve had to use for years. My friend and co-worker Jen Simmons has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://jensimmons.com/writing&quot;&gt;talking about&lt;/a&gt; CSS Grid &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRYrbcGWjzU&quot;&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt;, tirelessly pushing to get it implemented in browsers, and her work has paid off. As of the end of last year, the current version of &lt;em&gt;every major browser, desktop and mobile,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;supports CSS Grid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSS Grid really is powerful, and you can build dynamic content driven websites easily, like in &lt;a href=&quot;https://speckyboy.com/creative-examples-css-grid-layouts/&quot;&gt;these examples&lt;/a&gt;. However, Grid is good for more than laying out pretty blocks of content. Grid gives you full control over both dimensions of your layout, including scrolling. This means features we take for granted in native applications like collapsing side-panels and fixed toolbars are now trivial to implement. No more hacks and no more debugging. Grid just works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been building web tools for years. Here’s a screenshot of a game building tool I made for my retro RPGs. When &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Flexbox&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flexbox&lt;/a&gt; first appeared I immediately started using it. I built complex layouts using nested horizontal and vertical boxes, with a few utility classes for things like scrolling and stretching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/02/image4.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-31917 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/02/image4-500x309.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;309&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image4-500x309.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image4-250x155.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image4-768x475.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image4.png 982w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexbox has certainly made me more productive than absolutely positioned divs and float hacks, but it still has problems. Look at this closeup where panels come together. See how the footers on the left and right don’t line up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/02/image5.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-31918 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/02/image5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;348&quot; height=&quot;84&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image5.png 348w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image5-250x60.png 250w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s another screenshot. The toolbar is at the top of the drawing canvas, and according to my framework it should be fixed at the top, but the minute you start scrolling this happens. The toolbar disappears:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/02/image3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-31919 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/02/image3-500x458.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;458&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image3-500x458.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image3-250x229.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image3-768x703.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image3.png 1476w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these problems can be fixed with more positioning and float hacks, but the result is always fragile. Every time I add a new panel I have to debug my layout all over again; searching to identify which &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; is grabbing the extra space during a resize. And the markup is ugly. The nested horizontal and vertical boxes become very complicated, and this example is only two levels deep. As interaction and functionality become more complex the design becomes even more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div class='hbox'&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;div class='vbox'&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class='hbox'&amp;gt;header&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class='scroll'&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;div class='sidebar'&amp;gt;sidebar&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class='footer'&amp;gt;footer&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;div class=vbox&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class='hbox'&amp;gt;button button 
        spacer label spacer button button &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class='center'&amp;gt;main content&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class='hbox'&amp;gt;the footer&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;div class=vbox&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class=’hbox’&amp;gt;header&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class=’scroll’&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;div class=’sidebar’&amp;gt;sidebar&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class=’footer’&amp;gt;footer&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Entering the Second Dimension&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental problem with Flexbox is that it is one dimensional. This makes Flexbox great for one dimensional uses, like toolbars and navbars, but it begins to fail when I need to align content both horizontally and vertically at the same time. Instead I need real &lt;strong&gt;two&lt;/strong&gt; dimensional layout, which is why I need CSS Grid. Fundamentally Grid is 2D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a similar kind of layout built with CSS Grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/02/image1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-31920 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/02/image1-500x275.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;275&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image1-500x275.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image1-250x138.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image1-768x422.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image1.png 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look closely at the bottom footers. They come together perfectly. And by using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-gap&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;grid-gap&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the lines instead of adding borders to each panel, I don’t have to worry about inconsistent grid line widths. Everything just works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/02/image2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-31921 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/02/image2-500x204.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;204&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image2-500x204.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image2-250x102.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image2-768x314.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image2.png 1038w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest benefit I get from CSS Grid is adapting to changing conditions. My apps often have side panels. I need to make sure everything in the layout works regardless of whether the panels are expanded or collapsed, ideally without having to recalculate layout in JavaScript. Sidebars are made out of multiple components like headers and footers. All of these need to line up, regardless of which one is larger or smaller.  Grid can do this too using a magic function called &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/minmax&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;minmax()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve studied CSS Grid before then you know you can define your layout using &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-rows&quot;&gt;templates&lt;/a&gt; for the rows and columns.  A template like &lt;code&gt;200px 1fr 200px&lt;/code&gt; will give you 200px wide sidebars with a middle content area taking up the rest of the space. But what happens if the panel should collapse? Right now the column would stay at 200px, even though the content has shrunk. Instead we can use &lt;code&gt;minmax&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;min-content&lt;/code&gt; keyword for the max parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#grid &lt;/strong&gt;{
  &lt;strong&gt;display&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;grid&lt;/strong&gt;;
  &lt;strong&gt;box-sizing&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;border-box&lt;/strong&gt;;
  &lt;strong&gt;width&lt;/strong&gt;: 100&lt;strong&gt;vw&lt;/strong&gt;;
  &lt;strong&gt;height&lt;/strong&gt;: 100&lt;strong&gt;vh&lt;/strong&gt;;
  &lt;strong&gt;grid-template-columns&lt;/strong&gt;: 
      [&lt;strong&gt;start&lt;/strong&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;minmax&lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;auto&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;min-content&lt;/strong&gt;) 
      [&lt;strong&gt;center&lt;/strong&gt;]1&lt;strong&gt;fr &lt;/strong&gt;
      [&lt;strong&gt;end&lt;/strong&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;minmax&lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;auto&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt;min-content&lt;/strong&gt;);
  &lt;strong&gt;grid-template-rows&lt;/strong&gt;: 
      [&lt;strong&gt;header&lt;/strong&gt;]2&lt;strong&gt;em &lt;/strong&gt;
      [&lt;strong&gt;content&lt;/strong&gt;]1&lt;strong&gt;fr &lt;/strong&gt;
      [&lt;strong&gt;footer&lt;/strong&gt;]2&lt;strong&gt;em&lt;/strong&gt;;
  &lt;strong&gt;grid-gap&lt;/strong&gt;: 1&lt;strong&gt;px&lt;/strong&gt;;
  &lt;strong&gt;background-color&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;black&lt;/strong&gt;;
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the grid column will be always be just wide enough to hold whatever is in any of the columns using their &lt;em&gt;minimum width&lt;/em&gt;. Thus if one part of the column (say the header) is wider than the others, the column will expand to fit them all. If they become skinnier or disappear altogether, then the column will adjust accordingly. Essentially we have replicated the expanding/contracting behavior of Flexbox, but made it work with &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; in the column together, not just one item. This is &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; 2D layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the code for the rest of the demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
.&lt;strong&gt;start &lt;/strong&gt;{
  &lt;strong&gt;grid-column&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;start&lt;/strong&gt;;
}
.&lt;strong&gt;center &lt;/strong&gt;{
  &lt;strong&gt;grid-column&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;center&lt;/strong&gt;;
}
.&lt;strong&gt;end &lt;/strong&gt;{
  &lt;strong&gt;grid-column&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;end&lt;/strong&gt;;
}
&lt;strong&gt;header &lt;/strong&gt;{
  &lt;strong&gt;grid-row&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;header&lt;/strong&gt;;
}
&lt;strong&gt;footer &lt;/strong&gt;{
  &lt;strong&gt;grid-row&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;footer&lt;/strong&gt;;
}
.&lt;strong&gt;sidebar &lt;/strong&gt;{
  &lt;strong&gt;overflow&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;auto&lt;/strong&gt;;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;div &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;id=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;grid&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;header &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;class=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;start&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;header&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;header&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;header &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;class=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;center&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;button &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;id=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;toggle-left&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;toggle left&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;button&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
...
&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;header&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;header &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;class=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;end&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;header&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;header&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;

 
&amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;div &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;class=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;start sidebar&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;sidebar&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;div&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;div &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;class=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;center content&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;the center content&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;div&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;div &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;class=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;end sidebar&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
  sidebar&amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;br&lt;/strong&gt;/&amp;gt;
...
&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;div&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;footer &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;class=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;start&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;left footer&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;footer&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;footer &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;class=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;center&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;center footer&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;footer&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;footer &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;class=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;end&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;right footer&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;footer&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;div&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the toggle buttons in the upper header actually hide the sidebars I added this code. Note that with modern DOM APIs and arrow functions we can essentially replicate JQuery in just a few lines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;const &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;$ &lt;/em&gt;= (selector) =&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;document&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.querySelector(selector)
&lt;strong&gt;const &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;$$ &lt;/em&gt;= (selector) =&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;document&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.querySelectorAll(selector)
&lt;strong&gt;const &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;on &lt;/em&gt;= (elem, type, listener) =&amp;gt; elem.addEventListener(type,listener)

&lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;$&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;'#toggle-left'&lt;/strong&gt;),&lt;strong&gt;'click'&lt;/strong&gt;,()=&amp;gt;{
  &lt;em&gt;$$&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;&quot;.start&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;).forEach((elem) =&amp;gt; elem.classList.toggle(&lt;strong&gt;'closed'&lt;/strong&gt;))
})
&lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;$&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;'#toggle-right'&lt;/strong&gt;),&lt;strong&gt;'click'&lt;/strong&gt;,()=&amp;gt;{
  &lt;em&gt;$$&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;&quot;.end&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;).forEach((elem) =&amp;gt; elem.classList.toggle(&lt;strong&gt;'closed'&lt;/strong&gt;))
})
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also note that CSS Grid &lt;em&gt;does not&lt;/em&gt; deprecate Flexbox. We still use Flexbox in the cases where it makes sense: namely one dimensional content like toolbars. Here are the styles that I’m using for my toolbars made out of headers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;

&amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;header &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;class=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;center&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;button &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;id=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;toggle-left&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;toggle left&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;button&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;button&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;open&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;button&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;button&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;save&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;button&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;span &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;class=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;spacer&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;span&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;span&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;filename.txt&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;span&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;span &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;class=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;spacer&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;span&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;button&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;delete&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;button&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;button &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;id=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;toggle-right&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;toggle right&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;button&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;header&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;

&lt;strong&gt;header &lt;/strong&gt;{
  &lt;strong&gt;background-color&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;#ccc&lt;/strong&gt;;
  &lt;strong&gt;display&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;flex&lt;/strong&gt;;
  &lt;strong&gt;flex-direction&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;row&lt;/strong&gt;;
}

.&lt;strong&gt;spacer &lt;/strong&gt;{
  &lt;strong&gt;flex&lt;/strong&gt;: 1;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;spacer&lt;/code&gt; class makes an element take up all of the extra space. By using two spacers between the buttons I can make my toolbar shrink and grow as needed with the filename always in the middle. This is similar to native toolbars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can try out a demo live at this &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/joshmarinacci/full/EQXyvM&quot;&gt;Codepen&lt;/a&gt;, then remix it to poke and prod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSS Grid is wonderful for designing interactive applications with two-dimensional complexity. We can keep the markup semantic. Panels and toolbar line up properly. The &lt;code&gt;grid-gap&lt;/code&gt; gives us automatic borders. It adjusts our layout in complex ways without any JavaScript code, and it gives us control over both the horizontal and vertical. And we can do it all &lt;strong&gt;without&lt;/strong&gt; using a heavy CSS framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jen Simmons has started a new YouTube channel, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7TizprGknbDalbHplROtag&quot;&gt;Layout Land&lt;/a&gt; to help you grok how Grid works.  If you work on web apps or any kind of richly interactive website, you should try out CSS Grid.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The IRS’s Effort to Convert Its Assembly Codebase to Java</title>
<link>https://federalnewsradio.com/tom-temin-commentary/2018/01/irs-clutches-its-modernization-holy-grail/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://federalnewsradio.com/tom-temin-commentary/2018/01/irs-clutches-its-modernization-holy-grail/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;2018 could be the year the IRS crosses the final frontier in its 25-year modernization drive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, the agency has a short-term crisis. It has to translate the complicated new tax law into computer code. Its programmers must find all of the lines affected among millions of lines of code.  Their challenge is mainly time and scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency does some code revision every year.  But the scope this year is much larger than anything since the Reagan-era tax reforms…plus the underlying code has 36 more years worth of alterations preceding these changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IT is only part of the challenge. IRS needs new forms, new advisories, new instructions, and new training for its people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;promo-main&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;promo_dash&quot;&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;Insight by Booz Allen Hamilton: Technology experts explore cyber engineering in government in this free webinar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IRS gets knocks because so much of its code is written in assembler. Successive commissioners have described this code in countless hearings. Assembler is like Shakespearean English. It’s dated. A shrinking number of people can deal with it. But it’s also elegant and  highly functional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That this code has functioned through more than 50 filing seasons testifies to its durability. That it still works after countless alterations because of ever-changing policy testifies to the talent of the IRS work force. But assembler experts are becoming scarce, and IRS is called on to do much more than batch processing for which its assembler applications were optimized. Electronic filing, business intelligence, anti-fraud activities — all have spurred development of systems in a variety of architectures and languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus IRS operates many inter-related systems. It’s modernization efforts have produced some successes. But none of the efforts, none of the companies involved — principally the former Computer Sciences Corp. and IBM — have been able to solve what everyone understands is an essential key to modernizing. Namely, the individual and business master files that still exist as entities coded in assembler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, IRS is on the verge of solving this problem.  The solution was engineered by a group of about eight people. And not under a multi-hundred-million-dollar systems integration contract. A leader of the group &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; Jian Wang, a Chinese emigre who is now a naturalized citizen. Wang told me his solution isn’t a silver bullet but rather a carefully worked-out methodology. It has three components so potentially powerful the IRS has filed patent applications for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say “&lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt;” because he’s left the agency, and the status of the project is dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang was working under streamlined critical pay authority the agency has had since its landmark 1998 restructuring. It gave the IRS 40 slots under which it could pay temporary, full-time employees higher than GS rates. Former Commissioner John Koskinen pointed out Congress did not re-up this authority in 2013, despite his entreaties to former Congressman Jason Chaffetz’s Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;promo-main&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;promo_dash&quot;&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;An agency-by-agency look at the 2019 budget request&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The last one ran out this past summer,” Koskinen said. The departures included Wang. He says he applied to become a GS-15 or Senior Executive Service member so he could see through the assembler-to-Java project. But his approval didn’t come through until a week before his employment authority expired. By then he’d accepted another job. Wang says he had a house to pay for, kids to educate. Koskinen confirms the agency wanted to convert Wang. But the process of approval from Treasury headquarters and the Office of Personnel Management simply took too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a speech to the National Press Club last April, Koskinen mentioned Wang and his colleague Mark Yu “who developed a method for translating the programming language used in our legacy tax processing applications into the JAVA language.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang explained his solution to assembler conversion to me in some detail. It proceeds from the fact that “in theory, there’s no way to translate assembler code. They way it runs is not how it reads.” Indeed, because it is so tightly coupled to machine instruction sets, assembler looks totally cryptic to 21st century programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang and his team nonetheless developed a logical translation component, a “technical rule language” that acts as an intermediate stage to retain the logic withdrawn from the assembler, and a data extractor. By separating out the data, Wang says it was possible to trace the assembler logic flows, then abstract it into structured code in the technical rule language. He says testing proved the three parts could result in a Java program that accurately reproduces what the assembler code does. He said this was proven using production-sized data sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An early, comic&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac2fWCwDH9Y&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt; application&lt;/a&gt; of motion picture technology titled “Dog Factory” shows pooches being “translated” into coils of sausages and back again by a big, hand-cranked machine. (Thank you, Library of Congress for preserving this gem.) Converting assembler code won’t be such a simple input-output matter. The IRS has thousands of assembly modules. The resulting Java must be tested for interoperability with all the others and for security. But Wang’s work shows it can be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked with former IRS chief technology officer Terry Milholland. He said, “They were literally at the stage of converting assembler to Java when Wang left.” In fact, Milholland’s own special employment authority also ended then. He believes IRS has bid out this work. “It’s frustrating to see what’s possible but not happening.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve asked IRS repeatedly over a period of weeks to clarify what is going on, but so far it hasn’t made anyone who might know available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the individual and business master files were coded in the early 1960s, assembler was an ideal solution. Computers and memory of the day were expensive. An IBM computer typically came with 512K of memory. But the IRS knew what it was doing. For example, in 1975, &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=HwniRloeB6cC&amp;amp;pg=PA2&amp;amp;lpg=PA2&amp;amp;dq=IRS+master+tape+file&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=DOlnheGYi_&amp;amp;sig=Hz4riWGF2iodxheH4aRn_T4lRjY&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxjefX5qfYAhWoYd8KHVSGAcAQ6AEIXDAJ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=IRS%20master%20tape%20file&amp;amp;f=false&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Computerworld reported&lt;/a&gt; how IRS programmers handled a tax rebate program signed into law by President Gerald Ford. IRS used six IBM S/360s, each with 512K of memory, and an S/370 with 2M of memory. The machines drew on a total of 68 tape drives. The rebate job was scheduled to take five batch cycles of 320 hours each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, assembler is still excellent for this application. Milholland said of the code, “The assembler is well written. It’s incredibly efficient and effective.” But a shrinking number of people understand it. And it’s not optimized for the online, transaction mode to which the IRS needs to keep moving. Java, relatively inefficient as it may be, is the current standard and has legions of people who know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Wang is at another agency as a GS-15. This agency also has lots of legacy code, but it’s Cobol. Wang chuckled when I joked, compared to assembler, Cobol would be a piece of cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IRS techies seem to have a solution to their ultimate modernization puzzle in hand. If so, the question is whether they’ll use it.&lt;/p&gt;

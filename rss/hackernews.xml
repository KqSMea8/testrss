<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; vacuum cleaner, a hair straightener, a laptop, Christmas lights, an e-reader, a blender, a kettle, two bags, a pair of jeans, a remote-control helicopter, a spoon, a dining-room chair, a lamp and hair clippers. All broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds like a pile of things that you’d stick in boxes and take to the tip. In fact, it’s a list of things mended in a single afternoon by British volunteers determined to get people to stop throwing stuff away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the Reading Repair Cafe, part of a burgeoning international network aimed at confronting a world of stuff, of white goods littering dumps in west Africa and trash swilling through the oceans in huge gyres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hair clippers belong to William, who does not want to give his surname but cheerfully describes himself as “mechanically incompetent”. He has owned them for 25 years, but 10 years ago they stopped working and they have been sitting unused in his cupboard ever since.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News doesn't always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sits down at the table of Colin Haycock, an IT professional who volunteers at the repair cafe, which has been running monthly for about four years and is a place where people can bring all manner of household items to be fixed for free. In less than five minutes, Haycock has unscrewed and removed the blades, cleaned out some gunk from inside the machine, oiled the blades, and screwed it all back together. The clippers purr happily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William looks sheepish; Haycock looks pleased. “I wish they were all that simple,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the repairers will divert 24kg of waste from going to landfill and save 284kg of CO2. Some items can’t be fixed on the spot – notably a hunting horn split in two, which requires soldering with a blow torch – but very little needs to be thrown away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gabrielle Stanley, who used to run a clothing alterations business, says she was drawn to volunteering at the repair cafe to combat the “throwaway culture” she sees. “You go into certain stores...” - she throws a dark look - “how they can sell clothes for that price, when I couldn’t even buy the fabric for that much? And then you hear about things that happen [in the factories] in the far east.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An estimated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/11/uk-households-binned-300000-tonnes-of-clothing-in-2016&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;300,000 tonnes of clothing was sent to landfill in the UK in 2016&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/jul/29/fashion-must-fight-scourge-dumped-clothing-landfill&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;report from Wrap&lt;/a&gt; puts the average lifespan for a piece of clothing in the UK at 3.3 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globally, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.unu.edu/media/unu.edu/news/52624/UNU-1stGlobal-E-Waste-Monitor-2014-small.pdf&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;amount of e-waste generated&lt;/a&gt; is expected to hit 50m tonnes by the end of 2018. This is partly driven by consumers’ eagerness for new products, but there are also concerns about built-in obsolescence, in which manufacturers design products to break down after a certain amount of time and are often difficult or expensive to fix. In December, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/21/apple-admits-slowing-older-iphones-because-of-flagging-batteries&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Apple admitted to slowing older models of phones&lt;/a&gt;, though it claimed it did this for operational not obsolescence reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2018-03-12T10:06:24/embed.html&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Chart&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repair cafe volunteer Stuart Ward says that when fixing items is actively discouraged by manufacturers, repair becomes a political act. He is vehement about the “right to repair”, a movement opposed to the practices of companies like the machinery company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/06/nebraska-farmers-right-to-repair-john-deere-apple&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;John Deere, which, under copyright laws, doesn’t allow people to fix their own equipment or take them to independent repairers.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You own your equipment, you’re allowed to take a screwdriver to it and play with it,” he says. “It’s something fundamental.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teaching people how to fix their own gear is at the heart of the Edinburgh Remakery, a store on the main street of Leith that is part repair shop, part secondhand store, part repair education centre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We do the repair in front of a customer, not out in the back, not hidden,” says Sotiris Katsimbas, the lead IT technician at the Remakery. To do this, Katsimbas and his team conduct one-to-one IT repair appointments for a small fee, as do their colleagues who specialise in sewing and furniture repairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a matter of confidence. It’s not magic. Someone put it together, someone can take it apart, you only need a Phillips screwdriver and some knowledge,” says Katsimbas as he shows Daniel Turner how to open up his laptop so he can clean out the fluff and dust that is causing the machine to overheat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it opened in 2012, the Remakery has diverted 205 tonnes of waste that would have ended up in landfill. But the Remakery is unique in that, unlike much of the repair movement, which is volunteer-led, it is a viable business, employing 11 staff and 10 freelancers. Last year the shop had an income of £236,000 – 30% from grants, 70% generated through sales of furniture and electronics, workshops and repair appointments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn how to fix your electronics, the Restart Project runs events to teach people, you can see where their events are &lt;a href=&quot;https://therestartproject.org/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;atom--snippet__item&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to fix something round the house, but don't have the tools you need and can't afford to buy them for a one-off job, you can find a local &lt;a href=&quot;http://localtools.org/find/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;tool library&lt;/a&gt; where you can hire what you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;atom--snippet__item&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michelle McGagh spent a year without buying new things, which involved a fair amount of fixing as well as going without, her experiences make for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2016/nov/26/no-spending-year-over-new-way-living-wealthier-wiser&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;fascinating reading&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial viability of the shop makes it attractive as a model. In the last year, Sophie Unwin, the co-founder of the Remakery in Brixton and the founder of Edinburgh Remakery is setting up the Remakery network to replicate the work internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has had 53 inquiries from groups interested in setting up similar enterprises in the US, New Zealand, Canada, South Korea, Austria, Ireland, Germany, Australia and elsewhere in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network will provide toolkits and advice to groups who want to recreate what she has done in Edinburgh. Unwin hopes that these resources will allow other groups to do in two years what it has taken eight years of trial and error and extremely hard graft to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For repairers, fixing things is a way of doing something about an obsession with consumerism that Unwin calls “a kind of sickness in society”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is our little attempt to push a little bit in this direction,” says Ward. “To say, we can fix this, we can repair things, don’t give up hope.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>50M Facebook profiles harvested for Cambridge Analytica in major data breach</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The data analytics firm that worked with Donald Trump’s election team and the winning Brexit campaign harvested millions of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; profiles of US voters, in one of the tech giant’s biggest ever data breaches, and used them to build a powerful software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A whistleblower has revealed to the &lt;em&gt;Observer&lt;/em&gt; how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/cambridge-analytica&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Cambridge Analytica&lt;/a&gt; – a company owned by the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and headed at the time by Trump’s key adviser Steve Bannon – used personal information taken without authorisation in early 2014 to build a system that could profile individual US voters, in order to target them with personalised political advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Wylie, who worked with a Cambridge University academic to obtain the data, told the &lt;em&gt;Observer&lt;/em&gt;: “We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documents seen by the &lt;em&gt;Observer&lt;/em&gt;, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;is reporting&lt;/a&gt; that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/16/trump-mueller-russia-indictment-what-does-it-mean&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;indictments of 13 Russians&lt;/a&gt; by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, four days after the &lt;em&gt;Observer&lt;/em&gt; sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/03/suspending-cambridge-analytica/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Facebook announced&lt;/a&gt; that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the &lt;em&gt;Observer&lt;/em&gt; it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the &lt;em&gt;Observer&lt;/em&gt; which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/Sidebar-ca/embed.html&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Cambridge Analytica interactive&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That legal letter was sent several months after the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-pullquote element--supporting&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote-paragraph&quot;&gt;We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite class=&quot;pullquote-cite&quot;&gt;Christopher Wylie&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Observer&lt;/em&gt; has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/03/ca-who-is-who-zip/giv-3902gJiBgEmGEzJO/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Key players&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The algorithm and database together &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/07/the-great-british-brexit-robbery-hijacked-democracy&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;made a powerful political tool&lt;/a&gt;. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;atom--snippet__item&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;atom--snippet__heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexander Nix, CEO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;atom--snippet__heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aleksandr Kogan, data miner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;atom--snippet__heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steve Bannon, former board member&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/steve-bannon&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Steve Bannon&lt;/a&gt; was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;atom--snippet__item&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;atom--snippet__heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Mercer, investor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;atom--snippet__item&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her initial investigations uncovered the role of American billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Brexit&lt;/a&gt; referendum. These investigations are still continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK also remain live.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Nightmare Letter: A Subject Access Request Under GDPR</title>
<link>https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/nightmare-letter-subject-access-request-under-gdpr-karbaliotis/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/nightmare-letter-subject-access-request-under-gdpr-karbaliotis/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I had drafted a letter a few years ago detailing the worst kind of personal information access request that a Canadian company could receive under PIPEDA. I thought it might be useful to update that as a subject access request under GDPR, and present it as a worst-case situation (with thanks to Paul Breitbarth for reviewing this and offering some insights from a regulator's point of view). You might simply use this to make a case to your organization about what it could potentially receive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more interesting use would be to use this letter for a table-top exercise, similar to those used for data breaches, to see how your organization would respond. It might be very entertaining to have this kind of letter actually sent by a friendly party to your own organization to see exactly how it would be responded to - would the privacy office get alerted? How would the organization respond to someone knowledgeable about both the law and the technologies being used to support data management? Edit as appropriate to create the nightmare of your choosing. A future installment will address the nightmare of rectification, erasure and portability :-).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The nightmare letter:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Sir/Madam:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing to you in your capacity as data protection officer for your company. I am a customer of yours, and in light of recent events, I am making this request for access to personal data pursuant to Article 15 of the &lt;em&gt;General Data Protection Regulation&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;                     ix.    information and advice on what I can do to protect myself against any harms, including identity theft and fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b.   If you are not able to state with any certainty whether such an exposure has taken place, through the use of appropriate technologies, please advise what mitigating steps you have taken, such as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;                      i.    Encryption of my personal data;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;                      ii.    Data minimization strategies; or,&lt;/p&gt;

<title>iOS 11 bugs are so common they now appear in Apple ads</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/16/17131148/apple-ios-11-bug-face-id-ad</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/16/17131148/apple-ios-11-bug-face-id-ad</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;0irP7f&quot;&gt;If you blink during Apple’s latest iPhone ad, you might miss a weird little animation bug. It’s right at the end of a slickly produced commercial, where the text from an iMessage escapes the animated bubble it’s supposed to stay inside. It’s a minor issue and easy to brush off, but the fact it’s captured in such a high profile ad just further highlights Apple’s many bugs in iOS 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;y8wnPd&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; writer Benjamin Mayo &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bzamayo/status/974734836115099649&quot;&gt;spotted the bug&lt;/a&gt; in Apple’s latest ad, and he’s clearly surprised “that this was signed off for the commercial,” especially as he &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bzamayo/status/927559914792288256&quot;&gt;highlighted it months ago&lt;/a&gt; and has filed a bug report with Apple. It’s just one of many quirks in iOS 11, including strange UI problems in the Music app, regularly &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/921016374364917760&quot;&gt;misaligned text in the App Store&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/952251306869248002&quot;&gt;vanishing docks&lt;/a&gt;, and rotation issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;RQK6ky&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-pF5bV6bFOU?rel=0&amp;amp;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;MNSWIj&quot;&gt;It’s easy to dismiss all of these small problems because they’re not the types of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/2/16727238/apple-macos-ios-software-problems-updates&quot;&gt;Apple security bugs&lt;/a&gt; that have hit the headlines recently, but they all add up to a frustrating experience at times. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TDCVavaqDJCFjcQxZsL6InzHxPEYWwMMMh9QtfRGjbY/edit&quot;&gt;Chris Pirillo has been documenting&lt;/a&gt; iOS animation bugs for years now, highlighting the many bugs that have sneaked into iOS recently. “iOS has been performing in an inexplicably jarring manner since iOS 7,” says Pirillo in an open letter to Apple’s software engineering chief Craig Federighi. “Iterations don’t seem to help much, major or minor. Frame drops are now par for the course — irritations that we once slammed Android for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;RBAUya&quot;&gt;There are signs that Apple is finally about to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/30/16949802/apple-ios-12-next-version-update-focus-reliability-performance-new-features&quot;&gt;focus on reliability and performance in iOS 12&lt;/a&gt; over new features, though. Reports suggest Apple is delaying some major iOS additions, and planning to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-12/how-apple-plans-to-root-out-bugs-revamp-iphone-software&quot;&gt;root out bugs from its software&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully that will mean less of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/15/17015654/apple-iphone-crash-ios-11-bug-imessage&quot;&gt;embarrassing bugs that crash iPhones&lt;/a&gt;, but also far less of these weird animation and UI problems that iOS clearly struggles with at times. We’ll probably find out once we hear &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/13/17115548/apple-wwdc-2018-june-date-san-jose&quot;&gt;more about iOS 12 in June&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Inheritance Often Doesn&amp;#039;t Make Sense</title>
<link>https://www.sicpers.info/2018/03/why-inheritance-never-made-any-sense/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.sicpers.info/2018/03/why-inheritance-never-made-any-sense/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;There are three different types of inheritance going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ontological&lt;/em&gt; inheritance is about specialisation: this thing is a specific variety of that thing (a football &lt;em&gt;is a&lt;/em&gt; sphere &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; it has this radius)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abstract data type&lt;/em&gt; inheritance is about substitution: this thing behaves in all the ways that thing does &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; has this behaviour (this is the Liskov substitution principle)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Implementation&lt;/em&gt; inheritance is about code sharing: this thing takes &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the properties of that thing &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; overrides or augments them in this way. The inheritance in my post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sicpers.info/2018/03/on-inheritance/&quot;&gt;On Inheritance&lt;/a&gt; is this type and &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; this type of inheritance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are three different, and frequently irreconcilable, relationships. Requiring any, or even all, of them, presents no difficulty. However, requiring &lt;em&gt;one mechanism&lt;/em&gt; support any two or more of them is asking for trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common counterexample to OO inheritance is the relationship between a square and a rectangle. Geometrically, a square &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a specialisation of a rectangle: every square is a rectangle, not every rectangle is a square. For all s in Squares, s is a Rectangle and width of s is equal to height of s. As a type, this relationship is reversed: you can use a rectangle everywhere you can use a square (by having a rectangle with the same width and height), but you cannot use a square everywhere you can use a rectangle (for example, you can’t give it a different width and height).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that this is incompatibility between the inheritance directions of the &lt;em&gt;geometric properties&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;abstract data type properties&lt;/em&gt; of squares and rectangles; two dimensions which are completely unrelated to each other and indeed to any form of software implementation. We have so far said nothing about implementation inheritance, so haven’t even considered writing software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smalltalk and many later languages use single inheritance for implementation inheritance, because multiple inheritance is &lt;em&gt;incompatible&lt;/em&gt; with the goal of implementation inheritance due to the diamond problem (traits provide a &lt;em&gt;reliable&lt;/em&gt; way for the incompatibility to manifest, and leave resolution as an exercise to the reader). On the other hand, single inheritance is &lt;em&gt;incompatible&lt;/em&gt; with ontological inheritance, as a square is both a rectangle and an equilateral polygon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Smalltalk blue book describes inheritance &lt;em&gt;solely&lt;/em&gt; in terms of implementation inheritance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A subclass specifies that its instances will be the same as instances of another class, called its &lt;em&gt;superclass&lt;/em&gt;, except for the differences that are explicitly stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice what is missing: no mention that a subclass instance must be able to replace a superclass instance everywhere in a program; no mention that a subclass instance must satisfy all conceptual tests for an instance of its superclass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inheritance&lt;/em&gt; was never a problem: trying to use &lt;em&gt;the same tree&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;three different concepts&lt;/em&gt; was the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Favour composition over inheritance” is basically giving up on implementation inheritance. We can’t work out how to make it work, so we’ll avoid it: get implementation sharing by delegation instead of by subclassing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eiffel, and particular disciplined approaches to using languages like Java, tighten up the “inheritance is subtyping” relationship by relaxing the “inheritance is re-use” relationship (if the same method appears twice in unrelated parts of the tree, you have to live with it, in order to retain the property that every subclass is a subtype of its parent). This is fine, as long as you don’t try to &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; model the problem domain using the inheritance tree, but much of the OO literature recommends that you do by talking about domain-driven design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traits approaches tighten up the “inheritance is specialisation” relationship by relaxing the “inheritance is re-use” relationship (if two super categories both provide the same property of an instance of a category, neither is provided and you have to write it yourself). This is fine, as long as you don’t try to &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; treat subclasses as covariant subtypes of their superclasses, but much of the OO literature recommends that you do by talking about Liskov Substitution Principle and how a type in a method signature means that type &lt;em&gt;or any subclass&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the literature &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; do, I believe, is say “here are the three types of inheritance, focus on any one of them at a time”. I also believe that the &lt;em&gt;languages&lt;/em&gt; should support that (obviously Smalltalk, Ruby and friends &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; support that by not having any type constraints).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I’m using inheritance as a code sharing tool, it should not be assumed that my subclasses are also subtypes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I am using subtypes to tighten up interface contracts, I should be not only &lt;em&gt;allowed&lt;/em&gt; to mark a class anywhere in the tree as a subtype of another class anywhere in the tree, but &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; to do so: once again, it should not be assumed that my subclasses are also subtypes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I need to indicate conceptual specialisation via classes, this should &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; not be assumed to follow the inheritance tree. I should be not only &lt;em&gt;allowed&lt;/em&gt; to mark a class anywhere in the tree as a subset of another class, but &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; to do so: once again, it should not be assumed that my subclasses are also specialisations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your domain model is not your object model. Your domain model is not your abstract data type model. Your object model is not your abstract data type model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now inheritance is easy again.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>At My Lai: The Photographer Who Captured the Massacre</title>
<link>https://foto.gettyimages.com/archive/war/my-lai-massacre-anniversary-pictures-ron-haeberle/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://foto.gettyimages.com/archive/war/my-lai-massacre-anniversary-pictures-ron-haeberle/</guid>
<description>&lt;span class=&quot;img-attribution&quot;&gt;Ronald L. Haeberle/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Evelyn Theiss&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photographs of My Lai by Ron Haeberle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A note to our readers: This story contains photographs that are violent and disturbing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;Ron Haeberle was a combat photographer in Vietnam when he and the Army unit he was riding with — Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment — landed near the hamlet of My Lai on the morning of March 16, 1968. Villagers weren't alarmed; American GIs had visited the region near the central Vietnamese coast before, without incident. But within minutes, the troops opened fire. Over the course of the next few hours, they killed old men, women, and children. They raped and tortured. They razed the village. And when Haeberle's shocking photographs of their atrocities were published — more than a year later — the pictures laid bare an appalling truth: American &quot;boys&quot; were as capable of unbridled savagery as any soldiers, anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To mark the 50th anniversary of the massacre, I spoke with Haeberle — in an exclusive interview, at his home in Ohio — about that March morning; the routine Army operation that devolved into a waking nightmare; and how his photos changed the course of the war in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://foto.gettyimages.com/photos/horizontalCrop-GYI515288626-story-large.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-asset-id=&quot;515288626&quot; data-is360-image=&quot;false&quot; data-embeddable=&quot;false&quot; data-orientation=&quot;horizontal&quot; class=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;img-attribution&quot;&gt;Bettmann Archive&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first met Ron Haeberle in 2009 when I was a reporter at the Cleveland Plain Dealer — the newspaper that, in November 1969, first published his My Lai photos. I was assigned to write a story on the 40th anniversary of that landmark exposé, and while much had previously been written about the Plain Dealer reporter who wrote the article that ran alongside Haeberle's photos — Joe Eszterhas, later the screenwriter of &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; and other controversial films — I found almost nothing about the man who took the grisly, iconic pictures at My Lai. Was he still alive? Did he still live in Ohio?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a name, address, and phone number, but wasn’t sure if it was &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Ron Haeberle. Knowing that a reticent Haeberle might hang up if I called, I drove to the address, knocked on the door, and introduced myself. It was Ron, all right, and he graciously asked me in. I stayed at his house for two hours, as he told me about My Lai and his own life since 1968. It was his first major interview since the story broke four decades earlier. (He gave the BBC a couple of quotes in 1989, he said, and that was the extent of his contact with the press.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, FOTO asked me to approach Haeberle and ask if he would revisit the story for the 50th anniversary of the massacre. He agreed, and he and I returned to one of the darkest chapters in American history, and his role in bringing it to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://foto.gettyimages.com/photos/helicopters-that-brought-company-c-soldiers-to-mylai-for-assualt-picture-id50654720-story-large.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-asset-id=&quot;50654720&quot; data-is360-image=&quot;false&quot; data-embeddable=&quot;false&quot; data-orientation=&quot;horizontal&quot; class=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;img-attribution&quot;&gt;Ronald L. Haeberle/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ron Haeberle was drafted in 1966, after attending Ohio University, where he was a photographer for the school paper. He ended up in Hawaii with the Army’s Public Information Office. By the end of 1967, it was beginning to look like his &quot;tour&quot; would end there — a disappointing prospect. “As a photographer, I wanted to see what was happening in Vietnam for myself,&quot; he told me. He requested a transfer, and was sent to Vietnam. At 26 years old, he was older than most members of Charlie Company, where the average age was just 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://foto.gettyimages.com/photos/american-soldier-stoking-fire-of-burning-houses-during-the-my-lai-on-picture-id50654721-story-large.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-asset-id=&quot;50654721&quot; data-is360-image=&quot;false&quot; data-embeddable=&quot;false&quot; data-orientation=&quot;horizontal&quot; class=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;img-attribution&quot;&gt;Ronald L. Haeberle/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie Company had been together for about a year before Haeberle joined it in March 1968. The unit had been in no firefights, but had lost men to booby traps and land mines. When they landed at My Lai, they were primed for action; Viet Cong troops were reported to be hiding in the hamlet. That information was wrong. But in the end, it didn't matter: My Lai was doomed. Within four hours of Charlie Company's arrival, the village's huts were burned to the ground and hundreds of civilians were dead. (The exact number of those murdered is disputed to this day, with the official American estimate running to around 350; the Vietnamese say more than 500 were killed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haeberle told me that he had just met the men in his unit that morning. Almost as soon as they landed, he said, “I heard a lot of firing and thought, ‘Hell, we must be in a hot zone.' But after a couple of minutes we weren’t taking any fire, so we started walking toward the village. I saw what appeared to be civilians. Then I saw a soldier firing at them. I could not figure out what was going on. I couldn’t comprehend it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;graphic-content&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://foto.gettyimages.com/photos/civilians-killed-by-us-army-during-pursuit-of-vietcong-militia-as-per-picture-id50465292-story-large.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-asset-id=&quot;50465292&quot; data-is360-image=&quot;false&quot; data-embeddable=&quot;false&quot; data-orientation=&quot;horizontal&quot; class=&quot; sensitive&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;img-attribution&quot;&gt;Ronald L.

&lt;p&gt;WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, show it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;This photograph of murdered villagers in My Lai appeared — in black and white, not in its original color — on the front page of the Cleveland Plain Dealer on November 20, 1969. (Haeberle took the pictures not with his Army-issued Leica camera, but with his own camera, a Nikon.) Most of the victims at My Lai were shot; some were bayoneted. Women and girls were raped, and then killed. At least one soldier later confessed to cutting out villagers' tongues, and scalping others. Of course, My Lai was hardly the only instance of rape, torture, and murder by U.S. troops in Vietnam. But in terms of intensity and scale — and because of Haeberle's memorable photographs — it remains the emblematic massacre of the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Ron Haeberle lives about 40 miles from downtown Cleveland, in an attractive house on a quiet cul de sac. His home is simply furnished, clean, and orderly. Original works of art by Vietnamese artists, mostly abstracts, adorn the walls. One is a delicate needlework portrait of a woman, gracefully reaching an arm toward the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;graphic-content&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://foto.gettyimages.com/photos/corpses-of-vietnamese-civilians-killed-by-american-soldiers-during-picture-id50369688-story-large.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-asset-id=&quot;50369688&quot; data-is360-image=&quot;false&quot; data-embeddable=&quot;false&quot; data-orientation=&quot;horizontal&quot; class=&quot; sensitive&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;img-attribution&quot;&gt;Ronald L.

&lt;p&gt;Ok, show it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suddenness of the violence at My Lai was especially terrifying. Haeberle told me that he saw an old man with two small children walking toward U.S. troops, their belongings in a basket. &quot;The old man was shouting, ‘No VC! No VC!' to let the soldiers know he wasn’t Viet Cong,&quot; Haeberle recalled. To his horror, the man and the children were cut down in front of him. &quot;A soldier shot all three,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;graphic-content&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://foto.gettyimages.com/photos/vietnamese-civilians-killed-by-us-army-soldiers-during-pursuit-of-picture-id50538002-story-large.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-asset-id=&quot;50538002&quot; data-is360-image=&quot;false&quot; data-embeddable=&quot;false&quot; data-orientation=&quot;horizontal&quot; class=&quot; sensitive&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;img-attribution&quot;&gt;Ronald L.

&lt;p&gt;WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, show it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was more than a year after the massacre before Haeberle approached the Plain Dealer with his photos, but he had begun sharing his My Lai pictures, in slideshow talks to civic groups and even local high schools, after he returned home to northern Ohio in the spring of 1968. The first slides he showed were innocuous: troops with smiling Vietnamese kids; medics helping villagers. Then images of dead and mutilated women and children filled the screen. “There was just disbelief,&quot; Haeberle said of the reaction. &quot;People said, ‘No, no, no. This cannot have happened.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://foto.gettyimages.com/photos/group-of-civilian-women-and-children-rounded-up-to-be-killed-by-us-picture-id50654722-story-large.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-asset-id=&quot;50654722&quot; data-is360-image=&quot;false&quot; data-embeddable=&quot;false&quot; data-orientation=&quot;vertical&quot; class=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;img-attribution&quot;&gt;Ronald L.

&lt;p&gt;At one point in the killing spree, Haeberle and Army reporter Jay Roberts came upon a group of villagers huddled in fear after troops assaulted a number of young women. Haeberle took this photo — a tearful, frantic mother filling the center of the frame — and as he and Roberts moved on from the scene, rifle fire exploded behind them. “I thought the soldiers were interrogating them,” Haeberle told me. “Then I heard the firing. I couldn’t turn to look. But out of the corner of my eye, I saw them fall.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haeberle's picture of terror and distress on these faces, young and old, in the midst of slaughter remains one of the 20th century's most powerful photographs. When the Plain Dealer (and later, LIFE magazine) published it, along with a half-dozen others, the images graphically undercut much of what the U.S. had been claiming for years about the conduct and aims of the conflict. Anti-war protesters needed no persuading, but &quot;average&quot; Americans were suddenly asking, &lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; are &lt;em&gt;we doing in Vietnam?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, show it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;At times, the discovery of a single body was as jarring as coming upon dozens of corpses. Walking toward a dirt road known as Route 521, Haeberle and Jay Roberts noticed a woman in the distance. “She was hiding behind a rock. I saw her stand up, then heard shots,” Haeberle told me, the scene obviously sharp in his mind's eye 50 years later. “I knew she’d been hit because she fell back behind the rock. Later, I found her lying there and took this photo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;graphic-content&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://foto.gettyimages.com/photos/corpses-of-vietnamese-civilians-killed-by-american-soldiers-during-picture-id50538001-story-large.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-asset-id=&quot;50538001&quot; data-is360-image=&quot;false&quot; data-embeddable=&quot;false&quot; data-orientation=&quot;vertical&quot; class=&quot; sensitive&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;img-attribution&quot;&gt;Ronald L.

&lt;div class=&quot;graphic-content-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;graphic-content-lightbox&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, show it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awful images, not all of them captured on camera, remain with Haeberle to this day: a soldier nonchalantly shooting a young boy; another riding a water buffalo, repeatedly stabbing it with his bayonet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The massacre was first reported by journalist Seymour Hersh and distributed by a small wire agency, Dispatch News Service, in the second week of November 1969. (Hersh won the 1970 Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting for his work.) A week after Hersh's article appeared in dozens of papers around the U.S., the Plain Dealer ran its own story — along with Haeberle's photos to bolster the reports of a massacre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://foto.gettyimages.com/photos/head-of-man-floating-in-well-during-mylai-massacre-picture-id50537996-story-large.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-asset-id=&quot;50537996&quot; data-is360-image=&quot;false&quot; data-embeddable=&quot;false&quot; data-orientation=&quot;horizontal&quot; class=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;img-attribution&quot;&gt;Ronald L. Haeberle/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haeberle said it was an automatic response to continue taking pictures, even as the brutality escalated. “As a photographer, my role was to capture what was happening during the operation,&quot; he told me. &quot;I did feel that what I was shooting was historic, especially the carnage. I kept thinking, 'This is not right.' It was mind-boggling.&quot; (Above: Haeberle's reflection, with camera, can be seen at the top of this picture, as he photographs a corpse in a well. A soldier had shot an old man and dumped his body. &quot;They told me they threw him down there to poison the water supply,&quot; Haeberle said.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, trying to make sense of the unfathomable, Haeberle recalls the message imparted to so many soldiers before their arrival in Vietnam. &quot;We were told, 'Life is meaningless to these people,'&quot; he said, leaving unspoken the rest of that sentiment: &lt;em&gt;The enemy is not like us. They're not quite human.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://foto.gettyimages.com/photos/american-soldiers-helping-wounded-comrade-during-the-my-lai-massacre-picture-id50654717-story-large.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-asset-id=&quot;50654717&quot; data-is360-image=&quot;false&quot; data-embeddable=&quot;false&quot; data-orientation=&quot;vertical&quot; class=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;img-attribution&quot;&gt;Ronald L. Haeberle/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the photo above, American troops help a wounded comrade at My Lai. According to Haeberle, the soldier shot himself in the foot with his own gun. Haeberle can't say if the injury was a genuine accident or self-inflicted — perhaps a way to &quot;honorably&quot; avoid taking part in the carnage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://foto.gettyimages.com/photos/houses-burned-by-american-soldiers-during-the-my-lai-massacre-on-16-picture-id50537994-story-large.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-asset-id=&quot;50537994&quot; data-is360-image=&quot;false&quot; data-embeddable=&quot;false&quot; data-orientation=&quot;horizontal&quot; class=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;img-attribution&quot;&gt;Ronald L. Haeberle/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the late morning of March 16th, bodies were scattered everywhere in My Lai: some, like those above, were covered with straw and set alight. Elsewhere, soldiers had herded dozens of villagers into a roadside ditch and shot them. A few children survived by hiding under corpses. “Early on, after the old man and those two children were killed, Jay Roberts and I confronted (Charlie Company Capt. Ernest) Medina,&quot; Haeberle said, &quot;and told him what we'd seen.&quot; But Medina could not, or would not, help. Haeberle said that he and Roberts saw Medina again later, in the village, but the captain was on a field radio and would not speak to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medina faced a court martial in 1971, and was acquitted. (American helicopter pilot Hugh Thompson, gunner Lawrence Colburn, and crew chief Glenn Andreotta, who arrived in the midst of the massacre, were each awarded the Soldier's Medal for heroism on the 30th anniversary of My Lai, in recognition of their attempts to intervene and save villagers' lives, while risking their own.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://foto.gettyimages.com/photos/fort-benning-ga-army-1st-lt-william-l-calley-jr-arrives-january-20th-picture-id515289142-story-large.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-asset-id=&quot;515289142&quot; data-is360-image=&quot;false&quot; data-embeddable=&quot;false&quot; data-orientation=&quot;horizontal&quot; class=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;img-attribution&quot;&gt;Bettmann/Bettmann Archive&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haeberle's searing photos, along with stories in the Plain Dealer and other outlets in the fall of 1969, sparked outrage and soul-searching in much of America. The Army, meanwhile, had known about the massacre from the start, and had engaged in a long (and ultimately fruitless) cover-up. Of the dozen or so officers and others in Charlie Company who eventually faced court martial, only Lt. William Calley (pictured, center) was convicted. In the spring of 1971 he was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in prison. President Richard Nixon reduced the sentence to house arrest; Calley served three and a half years in his quarters at Fort Benning, Georgia. He is the only person found guilty in military or criminal court for the atrocities at My Lai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ron Haeberle never sought the spotlight. But he gets some solace knowing that his pictures mattered. “Photography can be a powerful medium,&quot; he said. &quot;It serves as evidence, as documentation. Without those photos, My Lai would have stayed hidden. Calley would not have been charged. After seeing the pictures, people had to re-think the war.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Haeberle/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;side-by-side&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://foto.gettyimages.com/photos/Ron_Duc-story-large.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-asset-id=&quot;&quot; data-is360-image=&quot;false&quot; data-embeddable=&quot;false&quot; data-orientation=&quot;horizontal&quot; class=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-img-idx=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;img-attribution&quot;&gt;Courtesy of Ron Haeberle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haeberle told me that he returned to My Lai in 2011, where he met Duc Tran Van, a survivor of the massacre. Duc was eight years old in March 1968, and as Haeberle spoke with him, through an interpreter, he realized with a jolt that the woman he had photographed dead behind a rock 43 years earlier was Duc’s mother, Nguyen Thi Tau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duc told Haeberle that his mother urged him to run, with his 20-month-old sister, to their grandmother's house. When he heard a helicopter above them, Duc threw himself to the ground to protect his sister, who was already wounded. Haeberle had captured that moment, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duc and Haeberle have since become friends (above, right: Haeberle and Duc in Vietnam in 2011), and the Army veteran has visited Duc in Germany, where he now lives. “Duc has a small shrine to his family in his home,” Haeberle said. “I took the last photo of his mother. So I gave him my camera, the Nikon I used at My Lai, for the shrine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haeberle is a thoughtful, plainspoken man. When I asked him if the publication of his pictures from My Lai changed the course of his own life, his response was characteristically muted. “How can we know that sort of thing?” he asked me. “What can we really know when we’re looking to the future? The photos made me more well-known than I might have been. But I just kept moving ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://foto.gettyimages.com/photos/this-picture-taken-on-may-8-2014-shows-a-general-view-of-rice-fields-picture-id492383275-story-large.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-asset-id=&quot;492383275&quot; data-is360-image=&quot;false&quot; data-embeddable=&quot;true&quot; data-orientation=&quot;horizontal&quot; class=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;img-attribution&quot;&gt;HOANG DINH NAM/AFP/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Haeberle left Vietnam in 1968, he flew to his brother’s home in Seattle, overlooking Puget Sound. “I sat without moving, for six hours,” he told me. “The sky and the water were so blue — I looked out the window and just tried to let everything go.&quot; Many others in Charlie Company turned to alcohol and drugs. A number later spoke of the guilt they felt. At least one is known to have committed suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haeberle is 76 years old, retired after years in manufacturing, divorced, with a grown daughter. He skis in winter, and kayaks in summer. An avid cyclist, he often heads west in the spring — Utah, California — for long cycling trips. He likes &quot;feeling like an ant amid the mountains,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has returned to Vietnam (above), and to My Lai several times, and will be there again on the 50th anniversary of the massacre. “The people in My Lai say they forgive us,” he told me. “They are a very forgiving people.” Haeberle has never regretted sharing his photos with the world. But that one act, he said, does not define his life. In his living room, 8,000 miles from My Lai, he said he's proud that he still has &quot;an adventurous spirit&quot; — connecting, for example, with Duc and other survivors in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he spoke, the afternoon light in Ohio was fading. &quot;I'm still learning,&quot; Haeberle said, &quot;about what the world has to offer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;column&quot; readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update on March 17, 2018, 9:50 AM: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;The claim that this is a data breach is completely false. Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent. People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;page&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;layoutArea&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column&quot; readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Originally published on March 16, 2018:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;We are suspending Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), including their political data analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica, from Facebook. Given the public prominence of this organization, we want to take a moment to explain how we came to this decision and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Maintain Strict Standards and Policies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.facebook.com/policy&quot;&gt;Platform Policies&lt;/a&gt; by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe. He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules. By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breaking the Rules Leads to Suspension&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens. We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Things Have Changed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are constantly working to improve the safety and experience of everyone on Facebook. In the past five years, we have made significant improvements in our ability to detect and prevent violations by app developers. Now all apps requesting detailed user information go through our &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/review/what-is-login-review&quot;&gt;App Review process&lt;/a&gt;, which requires developers to justify the data they’re looking to collect and how they’re going to use it – before they’re allowed to even ask people for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list. This is just one of the many ways we give people the tools to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/help/792552774106866&quot;&gt;control their experience&lt;/a&gt;. Before you decide to use an app, you can review the permissions the developer is requesting and choose which information to share. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications&quot;&gt;manage or revoke&lt;/a&gt; those permissions at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On an ongoing basis, we also do a variety of manual and automated checks to ensure compliance with our policies and a positive experience for users. These include steps such as random audits of existing apps along with the regular and proactive monitoring of the fastest growing apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We enforce our policies in a variety of ways — from working with developers to fix the problem, to suspending developers from our platform, to pursuing litigation.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>GrayKey iPhone unlocker poses serious security concerns</title>
<link>https://blog.malwarebytes.com/security-world/2018/03/graykey-iphone-unlocker-poses-serious-security-concerns/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.malwarebytes.com/security-world/2018/03/graykey-iphone-unlocker-poses-serious-security-concerns/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since the case of the San Bernadino shooter pitted Apple against the FBI over the unlocking of an iPhone, opinions have been split on providing backdoor access to the iPhone for law enforcement. Some felt that Apple was aiding and abetting a felony by refusing to create a special version of iOS with a backdoor for accessing the phone’s data. Others believed that it’s impossible to give backdoor access to law enforcement without threatening the security of law-abiding citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interesting twist, the battle ended with the FBI dropping the case after finding a third party who could help. At the time, it was theorized that the third party was Cellebrite. Since then it has become known that Cellebrite— an Israeli company—does provide iPhone unlocking services to law enforcement agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cellebrite, through means currently unknown, provides these services at $5,000 per device, and for the most part this involves sending the phones to a Cellebrite facility. (Recently, Cellebrite has begun providing in-house unlocking services, but those services are protected heavily by non-disclosure agreements, so little is known about them.) It is theorized, and highly likely, that Cellebrite knows of one or more iOS vulnerabilities that allow them to access the devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late 2017, word of a new iPhone unlocker device started to circulate: &lt;a href=&quot;https://graykey.grayshift.com/&quot;&gt;a device called GrayKey&lt;/a&gt;, made by a company named Grayshift. Based in Atlanta, Georgia, Grayshift was founded in 2016, and is a privately-held company with fewer than 50 employees. Little was known publicly about this device—or even whether it was a device or a service—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2018/03/05/apple-iphone-x-graykey-hack/#2d003cdb2950&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;until recently&lt;/a&gt;, as the GrayKey website is protected by a portal that screens for law enforcement affiliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Forbes, the GrayKey iPhone unlocker device is marketed for in-house use at law enforcement offices or labs. This is drastically different from Cellebrite’s overall business model, in that it puts complete control of the process in the hands of law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to an anonymous source, we now know what this mysterious device looks like, and how it works. And while the technology is a good thing for law enforcement, it presents some significant security risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How it works&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GrayKey is a gray box, four inches wide by four inches deep by two inches tall, with two lightning cables sticking out of the front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two iPhones can be connected at one time, and are connected for about two minutes. After that, they are disconnected from the device, but are not yet cracked. Some time later, the phones will display a black screen with the passcode, among other information. The exact length of time varies, taking about two hours in the observations of our source. It can take up to three days or longer for six-digit passcodes, according to Grayshift documents, and the time needed for longer passphrases is not mentioned. Even disabled phones can be unlocked, according to Grayshift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the device is unlocked, the full contents of the filesystem are downloaded to the GrayKey device. From there, they can be accessed through a web-based interface on a connected computer, and downloaded for analysis. The full, unencrypted contents of the keychain are also available for download.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As can be seen in the screenshot above, the GrayKey works on the latest hardware, and at least on iOS up to 11.2.5 (which was likely the most current system at the time this image was captured).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GrayKey device itself comes in two “flavors.” The first, a $15,000 option, requires Internet connectivity to work. It is strictly geofenced, meaning that once it is set up, it cannot be used on any other network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is also a $30,000 option. At this price, the device requires no Internet connection whatsoever and has no limit to the number of unlocks. It will work for as long as it works; presumably, until Apple fixes whatever vulnerabilities the device relies on, at which time updated phones would no longer be unlockable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offline model does require token-based two-factor authentication as a replacement for geofencing for ensuring security. However, as people often write passwords on stickies and put them on their monitors, it’s probably too much to hope that the token will be kept in a separate location when the GrayKey is not being used. Most likely, it will be stored nearby for easy access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Implications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For law enforcement, this is undoubtedly a boon. However, historically, similar stories involving cracking the iPhone haven’t turned out so well. Consider, for example, the case of the IP-Box, a similar device that was once used to access the contents of iPhones running older versions of iOS. The utility of the original IP-Box ended in iOS 8.2, which gave rise to the IP-Box 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the IP-Box 2 became widely available and was almost exclusively used illegitimately, rather than in law enforcement. Today, various IP-Boxes can still be found being sold through a variety of websites, even including Amazon. Anyone who wants such a device can get one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens if the GrayKey becomes commonplace in law enforcement? The cheaper model isn’t much of a danger if stolen—unless it’s stolen prior to setup—but at 4″x 4″x 2″, the unlimited model could be pocketed fairly easily, along with its token, if stored nearby. Once off-site, it would continue to work. Such a device could fetch a high price on the black market, giving thieves the ability to unlock and resell stolen phones, as well as access to the high-value data on those phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse, consider the implications of what is done to the phone itself. It is currently not known how the process works, but it’s obvious there is some kind of jailbreak involved. (A jailbreak involves using a vulnerability to unlock a phone, giving access to the system that is not normally allowed.) What happens to the device once it is released back to its owner? Is it still jailbroken in a non-obvious way? Is it open to remote access that would not normally be possible? Will it be damaged to the point that it really can’t be used as intended anymore, and will need to be replaced? It’s unknown, but any of these are possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also don’t know what kind of security is present on the networked GrayKey device. Could it be remotely accessed? Could data be intercepted in transit? Is the phone data stored on the device strongly encrypted, weakly encrypted, or is it not even encrypted at all? We don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people probably won’t get too excited about a criminal’s phone or data. However, let’s keep in mind one of the fundamental principles of the US judicial system: suspects are innocent until proven guilty. Should suspects be susceptible to these kinds of searches by law enforcement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, not all phones analyzed by law enforcement belong to suspects. In one digital forensics lab in 2014, around one-third of the devices analyzed were given to the authorities with explicit consent, by alleged victims or witnesses, to assist in the investigation. In such cases, a passcode would likely be given, but it’s possible it didn’t get passed on to the forensic technician. It’s also possible the technician may prefer to use the GrayKey to analyze the device regardless of availability of the passcode, due to the copious amounts of data it can generate from the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that many innocent people’s phones will end up being analyzed using a GrayKey device. What happens if their phones are given back in a vulnerable state, or their data is handled insecurely? That is not only a threat to the individual, but a liability for the police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Who should we trust?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most people in the US, law enforcement agents are people to be trusted. Obviously, this can’t be true in all cases, people being people, but let’s start from that assumption. Unfortunately, even if the agents themselves are completely trustworthy, sources in law enforcement have said that the computer systems used by law enforcement in the US are often quite poorly secured. Is it a good idea to trust sensitive data, some of which will come from the phones of innocent US citizens, to insecure systems?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little is known about Grayshift or its sales model at this point. We don’t know whether sales are limited to US law enforcement, or if it is also selling in other parts of the world. Regardless of that, it’s highly likely that these devices will ultimately end up in the hands of agents of an oppressive regime, whether directly from Grayshift or indirectly through the black market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also entirely possible, based on the history of the IP-Box, that Grayshift devices will end up being available to anyone who wants them and can find a way to purchase them, perhaps by being reverse-engineered and reproduced by an enterprising hacker, then sold for a couple hundred bucks on eBay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An iPhone typically contains all manner of sensitive information: account credentials, names and phone numbers, email messages, text messages, banking account information, even credit card numbers or social security numbers. All of this information, even the most seemingly innocuous, has value on the black market, and can be used to steal your identity, access your online accounts, and steal your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existence of the GrayKey isn’t hugely surprising, nor is it a sign that the sky is falling. However, it does mean that an iPhone’s security cannot be ensured if it falls into a third party’s hands.&lt;/p&gt;

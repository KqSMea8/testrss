<title>Trump administration cracks down on H-1B visa abuse</title>
<link>http://money.cnn.com/2018/02/23/technology/h1b-visa-abuse/index.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://money.cnn.com/2018/02/23/technology/h1b-visa-abuse/index.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;js-ie-storytop&quot; class=&quot;ie--storytop&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;cnnplayer&quot; id=&quot;cnnplayer0&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cnnVidplayer&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;summaryImg&quot; id=&quot;vid0&quot; href=&quot;/video/technology/2017/02/20/h-1b-visas-by-the-numbers.cnnmoney&quot; onclick=&quot;javascript:VideoPlayerManager.playVideos('cvp_story_0'); return false;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170220171414-h-1b-visa-1024x576.jpg&quot; width=&quot;780&quot; height=&quot;439&quot; alt=&quot;H-1B visas by the numbers&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;speakable&quot;&gt;The Trump administration is cracking down on companies that get visas for foreign workers and farm them out to employers.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;speakable&quot;&gt;Some staffing agencies seek hard-to-get H-1B visas for high-skilled workers, only to contract them out to other companies. There's nothing inherently illegal about contracting out visa recipients, but the workers are supposed to maintain a relationship with their employers, among other requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;speakable&quot;&gt;In some cases, outsourcing firms flood the system with applicants. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency said in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Laws/Memoranda/2018/2018-02-22-PM-602-0157-Contracts-and-Itineraries-Requirements-for-H-1B.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a new policy memo released Thursday&lt;/a&gt; it will require more information about H-1B workers' employment to ensure the workers are doing what they were hired for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies will have to provide specific work assignments, including dates and locations, to verify the &quot;employer-employee&quot; relationship between the company applying for an H-1B and its visa recipient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H-1B visas are valid for three years and can be renewed for another three years. It is a visa that is near and dear to the tech community, with many engineers vying for one of the program's 85,000 visas each year. (20,000 of that quota are reserved for advanced degree holders.) Demand for the visa often exceeds the supply -- in that case, a lottery system is activated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Since there is a limited number of H-1B visas it is important that those visa workers go where they are legitimately needed,&quot; attorney Sara Blackwell told CNN. Blackwell &lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/25/technology/disney-h1b-workers/index.html&quot;&gt;advocates&lt;/a&gt; for American workers replaced by foreigner visa holders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government's crackdown is in line with Trump's &lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/18/technology/h1b-reform/index.html?iid=EL&quot;&gt;direction to federal agencies&lt;/a&gt; to implement a &quot;Buy American, Hire American&quot; strategy. The administration proposed new rules and guidance for &lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/03/technology/h1b-visa-fraud/index.html&quot;&gt;preventing fraud and abuse&lt;/a&gt; of work visas -- particularly the H-1B program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The USCIS says it may limit the length of the visa to shorter than three years based the information an employer provides. For example, if an employer can't prove the H-1B holder is &quot;more likely than not&quot; needed for the full three years, the government might issue the visa for fewer than three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memo also says the administration wants to prevent employee &quot;benching.&quot; That's when firms bring on H-1B visa holders but don't give them work and don't pay them the required wages while they wait for jobs. Most projects don't need foreign workers for the full term, according to Monty Hamilton, CEO of IT contractor Rural Sourcing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although most agree that some employers abuse H-1B visas, how pervasive the abuse -- and how to prevent it -- remains a sensitive and divisive issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Cormier, a retired criminal investigator for federal law enforcement, says that asking for more information from third party companies could help the government crack down on bad actors. The threat of prosecution if companies are caught lying could be enough to deter fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;That could change the game completely,&quot; he told CNN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others say it could have an unintended consequence: Hurting those who are using the H-1B properly, according to Betsy Lawrence, the American Immigration Lawyers Association's director of government relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immigration attorney Tahmina Watson said the government has already been much stricter about H-1B enforcement since Trump took office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Much of what is said in the memo has been carried out in the last 12 months leading to record number of denials,&quot; Watson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian outsourcing firms will be the hardest hit. Indian workers receive more than 70% of all H-1B visas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies and immigration lawyers are preparing for the new H-1B lottery season. Applications must be filed on April 1st.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Most Intolerant Wins: The Dictatorship of the Small Minority (2016)</title>

<description>&lt;p name=&quot;92e2&quot; id=&quot;92e2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;(Chapter from &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Skin in the Game&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a6a5&quot; id=&quot;a6a5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;How Europe will eat Halal — Why you don’t have to smoke in the smoking section — Your food choices on the fall of the Saudi king –How to prevent a friend from working too hard –Omar Sharif ‘s conversion — How to make a market collapse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1890&quot; id=&quot;1890&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;graf-dropCap&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; he best example I know that gives insights into the functioning of a complex system is with the following situation. It suffices for an intransigent minority –a certain type of intransigent minorities –to reach a minutely small level, say three or four percent of the total population, for the entire population to have to submit to their preferences. Further, an optical illusion comes with the dominance of the minority: a naive observer would be under the impression that the choices and preferences are those of the majority. If it seems absurd, it is because our scientific intuitions aren’t calibrated for that (fughedabout scientific and academic intuitions and snap judgments; they don’t work and your standard intellectualization fails with complex systems, though not your grandmothers’ wisdom).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;eb55&quot; id=&quot;eb55&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The main idea behind complex systems is that the ensemble behaves in way not predicted by the components. The interactions matter more than the nature of the units. Studying individual ants will &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; (one can safely say never for most such situations), never give us an idea on how the ant colony operates. For that, one needs to understand an ant colony as an ant colony, no less, no more, not a collection of ants. This is called an “emergent” property of the whole, by which &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;parts&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;whole&lt;/em&gt; differ because what matters is the interactions between such parts. And interactions can obey very simple rules. The rule we discuss in this chapter is the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;minority&lt;/em&gt; rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9962&quot; id=&quot;9962&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The minority rule will show us how it all it takes is a small number of intolerant virtuous people with skin in the game, in the form of courage, for society to function properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*aK_PcqA4wVfsNAVjPmQbrA.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;1920&quot; data-height=&quot;1080&quot; data-is-featured=&quot;true&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*aK_PcqA4wVfsNAVjPmQbrA.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aK_PcqA4wVfsNAVjPmQbrA.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9667&quot; id=&quot;9667&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;This example of complexity hit me, ironically, as I was attending the New England Complex Systems institute summer barbecue. As the hosts were setting up the table and unpacking the drinks, a friend who was observant and only ate Kosher dropped by to say hello. I offered him a glass of that type of yellow sugared water with citric acid people sometimes call lemonade, almost certain that he would reject it owing to his dietary laws. He didn’t. He drank the liquid called lemonade, and another Kosher person commented: “liquids around here are Kosher”. We looked at the carton container. There was a fine print: a tiny symbol, a &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;U&lt;/em&gt; inside a circle, indicating that it was Kosher. The symbol will be detected by those who need to know and look for the minuscule print. As to others, like myself, I had been speaking prose all these years without knowing, drinking Kosher liquids without knowing they were Kosher liquids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*kB_cWkC195GVsgK-Kuym_Q.png&quot; data-width=&quot;340&quot; data-height=&quot;475&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*kB_cWkC195GVsgK-Kuym_Q.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 name=&quot;23c3&quot; id=&quot;23c3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Criminals With Peanut Allergies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9dbd&quot; id=&quot;9dbd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;A strange idea hit me. The Kosher population represents less than three tenth of a percent of the residents of the United States. Yet, it appears that almost all drinks are Kosher. Why? Simply because going full Kosher allows the producer, grocer, restaurant, to not have to distinguish between Kosher and nonkosher for liquids, with special markers, separate aisles, separate inventories, different stocking sub-facilities. And the simple rule that changes the total is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c9ef&quot; id=&quot;c9ef&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;A Kosher (or halal) eater will never eat nonkosher (or nonhalal) food , but a nonkosher eater isn’t banned from eating kosher.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8ca6&quot; id=&quot;8ca6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Or, rephrased in another domain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bd10&quot; id=&quot;bd10&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;A disabled person will not use the regular bathroom but a nondisabled person will use the bathroom for disabled people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5831&quot; id=&quot;5831&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Granted, sometimes, in practice, we hesitate to use the bathroom with the disabled sign on it owing to some confusion –mistaking the rule for the one for parking cars, under the belief that the bathroom is reserved for exclusive use by the handicapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;da32&quot; id=&quot;da32&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Someone with a peanut allergy will not eat products that touch peanuts but a person without such allergy can eat items without peanut traces in them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;72bf&quot; id=&quot;72bf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Which explains why it is so hard to find peanuts on airplanes and why schools are peanut-free (which, in a way, increases the number of persons with peanut allergies as reduced exposure is one of the causes behind such allergies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4910&quot; id=&quot;4910&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Let us apply the rule to domains where it can get entertaining:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6fd0&quot; id=&quot;6fd0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;An honest person will never commit criminal acts but a criminal will readily engage in legal acts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d8c4&quot; id=&quot;d8c4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Let us call such minority an &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;intransigent&lt;/em&gt; group, and the majority a &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;flexible&lt;/em&gt; one. And the rule is an asymmetry in choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f43f&quot; id=&quot;f43f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I once pulled a prank on a friend. Years ago when Big Tobacco were hiding and repressing the evidence of harm from secondary smoking, New York had smoking and nonsmoking sections in restaurants (even airplanes had, absurdly, a smoking section). I once went to lunch with a friend visiting from Europe: the restaurant only had availability in the smoking sections. I convinced the friend that we needed to buy cigarettes as we &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;had to&lt;/em&gt; smoke in the smoking section. He complied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b022&quot; id=&quot;b022&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Two more things. First, the geography of the terrain, that is, the spatial structure, matters a bit; it makes a big difference whether the intransigents are in their own district or are mixed with the rest of the population. If the people following the minority rule lived in Ghettos, with their separate small economy, then the minority rule would not apply. But, when a population has an even spatial distribution, say the ratio of such a minority in a neighborhood is the same as that in the village, that in the village is the same as in the county, that in the county is the same as that in state, and that in the sate is the same as nationwide, then the (flexible) majority will have to submit to the minority rule. Second, the cost structure matters quite a bit. It happens in our first example that making lemonade compliant with Kosher laws doesn’t change the price by much, not enough to justify inventories. But if the manufacturing of Kosher lemonade cost substantially more, then the rule will be weakened in some nonlinear proportion to the difference in costs. If it cost ten times as much to make Kosher food, then the minority rule will not apply, except perhaps in some very rich neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a210&quot; id=&quot;a210&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Muslims have Kosher laws so to speak, but these are much narrower and apply only to meat. For Muslim and Jews have near-identical slaughter rules (all Kosher is halal for most Sunni Muslims, or was so in past centuries, but the reverse is not true). Note that these slaughter rules are skin-in-the-game driven, inherited from the ancient Eastern Mediterranean [discussed in Chapter] Greek and Semitic practice to only worship the gods if one has skin in the game, sacrifice meat to the divinity, and eat what’s left. The Gods do not like cheap signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;681f&quot; id=&quot;681f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Now consider this manifestation of the dictatorship of the minority. In the United Kingdom, where the (practicing) Muslim population is only three to four percent, a very high number of the meat we find is halal. Close to seventy percent of lamb imports from New Zealand are halal. Close to ten percent of the chain Subway carry halal-only stores (meaning no pork), in spite of the high costs from the loss of business of nonpork stores. The same holds in South Africa where, with the same proportion of Muslims, a disproportionately higher number of chicken is Halal certified. But in the U.K. and other Christian countries, halal is not neutral enough to reach a high level, as people may rebel against forceful abidance to other’s religious norms. For instance, the 7th Century Christian Arab poet Al-Akhtal made a point to never eat halal meat, in his famous defiant poem boasting his Christianity: “I do not eat sacrificial flesh”. (Al-Akhtal was reflecting the standard Christian reaction from three or four centuries earlier — Christians were tortured in pagan times by being forced to eat sacrificial meat, which they found sacrilegious. Many Christian martyrs starved to death.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6cbc&quot; id=&quot;6cbc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;One can expect the same rejection of religious norms to take place in the West as the Muslim populations in Europe grows.&lt;/p&gt;

Figure 2 Renormalization group: steps one through three (start from the top): Four boxes containing four boxes, with one of the boxes pink at step one, with successive applications of the minority rule.
&lt;p name=&quot;2faf&quot; id=&quot;2faf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;So the minority rule may produce a larger share of halal food in the stores than warranted by the proportion of halal eaters in the population, but with a headwind somewhere because some people may have a taboo against Moslem food. But with some non-religious Kashrut rules, so to speak, the share can be expected converge to closer to a hundred percent (or some high number). In the U.S. and Europe, “organic” food companies are selling more and more products precisely because of the minority rule and because ordinary and unlabeled food may be seen by some to contain pesticides, herbicides, and transgenic genetically modified organisms, “GMOs” with, according to them, unknown risks. (What we call GMOs in this context means transgenic food, entailing the transfer of genes from a foreign organism or species). Or it could be for some existential reasons, cautious behavior, or Burkean conservatism –some may not want to venture too far too fast from what their grandparents ate. Labeling something “organic” is a way to say that it contains no transgenic GMOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7626&quot; id=&quot;7626&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In promoting genetically modified food via all manner of lobbying, purchasing of congressmen, and overt scientific propaganda (with smear campaigns against such persons as yours truly), the big agricultural companies foolishly believed that all they needed was to win the majority. No, you idiots. As I said, your snap “scientific” judgment is too naive in these type of decisions. Consider that transgenic-GMO eaters will eat nonGMOs, but not the reverse. So it may suffice to have a tiny, say no more than five percent of evenly spatially distributed population of non-genetically modified eaters for the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; population to have to eat non-GMO food. How? Say you have a corporate event, a wedding, or a lavish party to celebrate the fall of the Saudi Arabian regime, the bankruptcy of the rent-seeking investment bank Goldman Sachs, or the public reviling of Ray Kotcher, chairman of Ketchum the public relation firm that smears scientists and scientific whistleblowers on behalf of big corporations. Do you need to send a questionnaire asking people if they eat or don’t eat transgenic GMOs and reserve special meals accordingly? No. You just select everything non-GMO, provided the price difference is not consequential. And the price difference appears to be small enough to be negligible as (perishable) food costs in America are largely, about up to eighty or ninety percent, determined by distribution and storage, not the cost at the agricultural level. And as organic food (and designations such as “natural”) is in higher demand, from the minority rule, distribution costs decrease and the minority rule ends up accelerating in its effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e9f5&quot; id=&quot;e9f5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Big Ag (the large agricultural firms) did not realize that this is the equivalent of entering a game in which one needed to not just win more points than the adversary, but win ninety-seven percent of the total points just to be safe. It is strange, once again, to see Big Ag who spent hundreds of millions of dollars on research cum smear campaigns, with hundreds of these scientists who think of themselves as more intelligent than the rest of the population, miss such an elementary point about asymmetric choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2bab&quot; id=&quot;2bab&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Another example: do not think that the spread of automatic shifting cars is necessarily due to the majority of drivers initially preferring automatic; it can just be because those who can drive manual shifts can always drive automatic, but the reciprocal is not true &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15#_ftn1&quot; data-href=&quot;#_ftn1&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;342b&quot; id=&quot;342b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The method of analysis employed here is called renormalization group, a powerful apparatus in mathematical physics that allows us to see how things scale up (or down). Let us examine it next –without mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;efe4&quot; id=&quot;efe4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Renormalization Group&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b5b1&quot; id=&quot;b5b1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Figure 2 shows four boxes exhibiting what is called fractal self-similarity. Each box contains four smaller boxes. Each one of the four boxes will contain four boxes, and so all the way down, and all the way up until we reach a certain level. There are two colors: yellow for the majority choice, and pink for the minority one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ca6e&quot; id=&quot;ca6e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Assume the smaller unit contains four people, a family of four. One of them is in the intransigent minority and eats only nonGMO food (which includes organic). The color of the box is pink and the others yellow . We “renormalize once” as we move up: the stubborn daughter manages to impose her rule on the four and the unit is now all pink, i.e. will opt for nonGMO. Now, step three, you have the family going to a barbecue party attended by three other families. As they are known to only eat nonGMO, the guests will cook only organic. The local grocery store realizing the neighborhood is only nonGMO switches to nonGMO to simplify life, which impacts the local wholesaler, and the stories continues and “renormalizes”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5d07&quot; id=&quot;5d07&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;By some coincidence, the day before the Boston barbecue, I was flaneuring in New York, and I dropped by the office of a friend I wanted to prevent from working, that is, engage in an activity that when abused, causes the loss of mental clarity, in addition to bad posture and loss of definition in the facial features. The French physicist Serge Galam happened to be visiting and chose the friend’s office to kill time. Galam was first to apply these renormalization techniques to social matters and political science; his name was familiar as he is the author of the main book on the subject, which had then been sitting for months in an unopened Amazon box in my basement. He introduced me to his research and showed me a computer model of elections by which it suffices that some minority exceeds a certain level for its choices to prevail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9950&quot; id=&quot;9950&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So the same illusion exists in political discussions, spread by the political “scientists”: you think that because some extreme right or left wing party has, say, the support of ten percent of the population that their candidate would get ten percent of the votes. No: these baseline voters should be classified as “inflexible” and will always vote for their faction. But some of the flexible voters &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; also vote for that extreme faction, just as nonKosher people can eat Kosher, and these people are the ones to watch out for as they may swell the numbers of votes for the extreme party. Galam’s models produced a bevy of counterintuitive effects in political science –and his predictions turned out to be way closer to real outcomes than the naive consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;6f03&quot; id=&quot;6f03&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The Veto&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0078&quot; id=&quot;0078&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;The fact we saw from the renormalization group the “veto” effect as a person in a group can steer choices. Rory Sutherland suggested that this explains why some fast-food chains, such as McDonald thrive, not because they offer a great product, but because they are not vetoed in a certain socio-economic group –and by a small proportions of people in that group at that. To put it in technical terms, it was a best worse-case divergence from expectations: a lower variance and lower mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;df3d&quot; id=&quot;df3d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When there are few choices, McDonald’s appears to be a safe bet. It is also a safe bet in shady places with few regulars where the food variance from expectation can be consequential –I am writing these lines in Milan’s cental train station and as offensive as it can be to a visitor from far away, McDonald’s is one of the few restaurants there. Shockingly, one sees Italians there seeking refuge from a risky meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;36d8&quot; id=&quot;36d8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Pizza is the same story: it is commonly accepted food and outside a fancy party nobody will be blamed for ordering it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;abbc&quot; id=&quot;abbc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Rory wrote to me about the asymmetry beer-wine and the choices made for parties: “Once you have ten percent or more women at a party, you cannot serve only beer. But most men will drink wine. So you only need one set of glasses if you serve only wine — the universal donor, to use the language of blood groups.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b309&quot; id=&quot;b309&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This strategy of the best lower bound might have been played by the Khazars looking to chose between Islam, Judaism, and Christianity. Legend has it that three high ranking delegations (bishops, rabbis and sheikhs) came to make the sales pitch. They asked the Christians: if you were forced to chose between Judaism and Islam, which one would you pick? Judaism, they replied. Then they asked the Muslim: which of the two, Christianity or Judaism. Judaism, the Muslim said. Judaim it was and the tribe converted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;4c66&quot; id=&quot;4c66&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Lingua Franca&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9fef&quot; id=&quot;9fef&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;If a meeting is taking place in Germany in the Teutonic-looking conference room of a corporation that is sufficiently international or European, and one of the persons in the room doesn’t speak German, the entire meeting will be run in… English, the brand of inelegant English used in corporations across the world. That way they can equally offend their Teuronic ancestors and the English language&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15#_ftn2&quot; data-href=&quot;#_ftn2&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;. It all started with the asymmetric rule that those who are nonnative in English know (bad) English, but the reverse (English speakers knowing other languages) is less likely. French was supposed to be the language of diplomacy as civil servants coming from aristocratic background used it –while their more vulgar compatriots involved in commerce relied on English. In the rivalry between the two languages, English won as commerce grew to dominate modern life; the victory it has nothing to do with the prestige of France or the efforts of their civil servants in promoting their more or less beautiful Latinized and logically spelled language over the orthographically confusing one of trans-Channel meat-pie eaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;79ec&quot; id=&quot;79ec&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We can thus get some intuition on how the emergence of &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;lingua franca&lt;/em&gt; languages can come from minority rules–and that is a point that is not visible to linguists. Aramaic is a Semitic language which succeeded Canaanite (that is, Phoenician-Hebrew) in the Levant and resembles Arabic; it was the language Jesus Christ spoke. The reason it came to dominate the Levant and Egypt isn’t because of any particular imperial Semitic power or the fact that they have interesting noses. It was the Persians –who speak an Indo-European language –who spread Aramaic, the language of Assyria, Syria, and Babylon. Persians taught Egyptians a language that was not their own. Simply, when the Persians invaded Babylon they found an administration with scribes who could only use Aramaic and didn’t know Persian, so Aramaic became the state language. If your secretary can only take dictation in Aramaic, Aramaic is what you will use. This led to the oddity of Aramaic being used in Mongolia, as records were maintained in the Syriac alphabet (Syriac is the Eastern dialect of Aramaic). And centuries later, the story would repeat itself in reverse, with the Arabs using Greek in their early administration in the seventh and eighth’s centuries. For during the Hellenistic era, Greek replaced Aramaic as the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;lingua franca&lt;/em&gt; in the Levant, and the scribes of Damascus maintained their records in Greek. But it was not the Greeks who spread Greek around the Mediterranean –Alexander (himself not Greek but Macedonian and spoke a different dialect of Greek) did not lead to an immediate deep cultural Hellenization. It was the Romans who accelerated the spreading of Greek, as they used it in their administration across the Eastern empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1acf&quot; id=&quot;1acf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;A French Canadian friend from Montreal, Jean-Louis Rheault, commented as follows, bemoaning the loss of language of French Canadians outside narrowly provincial areas. He said: “In Canada, when we say bilingual, it is English speaking and when we say “French speaking” it becomes bilingual.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;756b&quot; id=&quot;756b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Decentralize, Again&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9f0b&quot; id=&quot;9f0b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Another attribute of decentralization, and one that the “intellectuals” opposing an exit of Britain from the European Union (Brexit ) don’t get. If one needs, say a three pct. threshold in a political unit for the minority rule to take its effect, and &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;on average&lt;/em&gt; the stubborn minority represents three pct. of the population, with variations around the average, then some states will be subject to the rule, but not others. If on the other hand we merged all states in one, then the minority rule will prevail all across. This is the reason the U.S.A. works so well as, I have been repeating to everyone who listens, we are a federation, not a republic. To use the language of &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Antifragile&lt;/em&gt;, decentralization is &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;convex&lt;/em&gt; to variations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;bcd1&quot; id=&quot;bcd1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Genes vs Languages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0bcd&quot; id=&quot;0bcd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Looking at genetic data in the Eastern Mediterranean with my collaborator the geneticist Pierre Zalloua, we noticed that both invaders, Turks and Arabs left little genes and in the case of Turkey, the tribes from East and Central Asia brought an entirely new language. Turkey, shockingly, still has the populations of Asia Minor you read about in history books, but with new names. Further, Zalloua and his colleagues have shown that Canaanites from 3700 years ago represent more than nine tenth of the genes of current residents of the state of Lebanon, with only a tiny amount of new genes added, in spite of about every possible army having dropped by for sightseeing and some pillaging.&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15#_ftn1&quot; data-href=&quot;#_ftn1&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; While Turks are Mediterraneans who speak an East Asian language, the French (North of Avignon) are largely of Northern European stock, yet they speak a Mediterranean language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8208&quot; id=&quot;8208&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b4dd&quot; id=&quot;b4dd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Genes follow majority rules; languages minority rule&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;939b&quot; id=&quot;939b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Languages travel; genes less so&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9dd2&quot; id=&quot;9dd2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This shows us the recent mistake to build racial theories on language, dividing people into “Aryans” and “Semites”, based on linguistic considerations. While the subject was central to the German Nazis, the practice continues today in one form or another, often benign. For the great irony is that Nordic supremacists (“Aryan”), while anti-Semitic, used the classical Greeks to give themselves a pedigree and a link to a glorious civilization, but didn’t realize that the Greeks and their Mediterranean “Semitic” neighbors were actually genetically close to one another. It has been recently shown that both ancient Greeks and Bronze age Levantines share an Anatolian origin. It just happened that the languages diverged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c214&quot; id=&quot;c214&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15#_ftnref1&quot; data-href=&quot;#_ftnref1&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; There is a current controversy in the U.K. as the Normand left more texts and pictures in history books than genes there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;09fe&quot; id=&quot;09fe&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The One-Way Street of Religions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;83a5&quot; id=&quot;83a5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;In the same manner, the spread of Islam in the Near East where Christianity was heavily entrenched (it was born there) can be attributed to two simple asymmetries. The original Islamic rulers weren’t particularly interested in converting Christians as these provided them with tax revenues –the proselytism of Islam did not address those called “people of the book”, i.e. individuals of Abrahamic faith. In fact, my ancestors who survived thirteen centuries under Muslim rule saw advantages in not being Muslim: mostly in the avoidance of military conscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;34ea&quot; id=&quot;34ea&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The two asymmetric rules were are as follows. First, if a non Muslim man under the rule of Islam marries a Muslim woman, he needs to convert to Islam –and if &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; parents of a child happens to be Muslim, the child will be Muslim&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15#_ftn3&quot; data-href=&quot;#_ftn3&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;. Second, becoming Muslim is irreversible, as apostasy is the heaviest crime under the religion, sanctioned by the death penalty. The famous Egyptian actor Omar Sharif, born Mikhael Demetri Shalhoub, was of Lebanese Christian origins. He converted to Islam to marry a famous Egyptian actress and had to change his name to an Arabic one. He later divorced, but did not revert to the faith of his ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4f89&quot; id=&quot;4f89&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Under these two asymmetric rules, one can do simple simulations and see how a small Islamic group occupying Christian (Coptic) Egypt can lead, over the centuries, to the Copts becoming a tiny minority. All one needs is a small rate of interfaith marriages. Likewise, one can see how Judaism doesn’t spread and tends to stay in the minority, as the religion has opposite rules: the mother is required to be Jewish, causing interfaith marriages to leave the community. An even stronger asymmetry than that of Judaism explains the depletion in the Near East of three Gnostic faiths: the Druze, the Ezidi, and the Mandeans (Gnostic religions are those with &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;mysteries&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt; that is typically accessible to only a minority of elders, with the rest of the members in the dark about the details of the faith). Unlike Islam that requires either parents to be Muslim, and Judaism that asks for at least the mother to have the faith, these three religions require &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; parents to be of the faith, otherwise the person says &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;toodaloo&lt;/em&gt; to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a21a&quot; id=&quot;a21a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Egypt has a flat terrain. The distribution of the population presents homogeneous mixtures there, which permits renormalization (i.e. allows the asymmetric rule to prevail) –we saw earlier in the chapter that for Kosher rules to work, one needed Jews to be somewhat spread out across the country. But in places such as Lebanon, Galilee, and Northern Syria, with mountainous terrain, Christians and other Non Sunni Muslims remained concentrated. Christians not being exposed to Muslims, experienced no intermarriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b39f&quot; id=&quot;b39f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Egypt’s Copts suffered from another problem: the irreversibility of Islamic conversions. Many Copts during Islamic rule converted to Islam when it was merely an administrative procedure, something that helps one land a job or handle a problem that requires Islamic jurisprudence. One do not have to really believe in it since Islam doesn’t conflict markedly with Orthodox Christianity. Little by little a Christian or Jewish family bearing the marrano-style conversion becomes truly converted, as, a couple of generations later, the descendants forget the arrangement of their ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7e05&quot; id=&quot;7e05&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So all Islam did was out-stubborn Christianity, which itself won thanks to its own stubbornness. For, before Islam, the original spread of Christianity in the Roman empire can be largely seen due to… the blinding intolerance of Christians, their unconditional, aggressive and proselyting recalcitrance. Roman pagans were initially tolerant of Christians, as the tradition was to share gods with other members of the empire. But they wondered why these Nazarenes didn’t want to give and take gods and offer that Jesus fellow to the Roman pantheon in exchange for some other gods. What, our gods aren’t good enough for them? But Christians were intolerant of Roman paganism. The “persecutions” of the Christians had vastly more to do with the intolerance of the Christians for the pantheon and local gods, than the reverse. What we read is history written by the Christian side, not the Greco-Roman one. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15#_ftn4&quot; data-href=&quot;#_ftn4&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e88a&quot; id=&quot;e88a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We know too little about the Roman side during the rise of Christianity, as hagiographies have dominated the discourse: we have for instance the narrative of the martyr Saint Catherine, who kept converting her jailors until she was beheaded, except that… she may have never existed. There are endless histories of Christian martyrs and saints –but very little about the other side, Pagan heroes. All we have is the bit we know about the reversion to Christianity during the emperor Julian’s apostasy and the writings of his entourage of Syrian-Greek pagans such as Libanius Antiochus. Julian had tried to go back to Ancient Paganism in vain: it was like trying to keep a balloon under water. And it was not because the majority was pagan as historians mistakenly think: it was because the Christian side was too unyielding. Christianity had great minds such as Gregorius of Nazianzen and Basil of Caesaria, but nothing to match the great orator Libanius, not even close. (My heuristic is that the more pagan, the more brilliant one’s mind, and the higher one’s ability to handle nuances and ambiguity. Purely monotheistic religious such as Protestant Christianity, Salafi Islam, or fundamentalist atheism accommodate literalist and mediocre minds that cannot handle ambiguity.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;62f8&quot; id=&quot;62f8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In fact we can observe in the history of Mediterranean “religions” or, rather, rituals and systems of behavior and belief, a drift dictated by the intolerant, actually bringing the system closer to what we can call a religion. Judaism might have almost lost because of the mother-rule and the confinement to a tribal base, but Christianity ruled, and for the very same reasons, Islam did. Islam? there have been many &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Islams&lt;/em&gt;, the final accretion quite different from the earlier ones. For Islam itself is ending up being taken over (in the Sunni branch) by the purists simply because these were more intolerant than the rest: the Wahhabis, founders of Saudi Arabia, were the ones who destroyed the shrines, and to impose the maximally intolerant rule, in a manner that was later imitated by “ISIS” (the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria/the Levant). Every single accretion of Sunni Islam seems to be there to accommodate the most intolerant of its branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;89d1&quot; id=&quot;89d1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Imposing Virtue on Others&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ab4e&quot; id=&quot;ab4e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;This idea of one-sidedness can help us debunk a few more misconceptions. How do books get banned? Certainly not because they offend the average person –most persons are passive and don’t really care, or don’t care enough to request the banning. It looks like, from past episodes, that all it takes is a few (motivated) activists for the banning of some books, or the black-listing of some people. The great philosopher and logician Bertrand Russell lost his job at the City University of New York owing to a letter by an angry –and stubborn –mother who did not wish to have her daughter in the same room as the fellow with dissolute lifestyle and unruly ideas. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15#_ftn5&quot; data-href=&quot;#_ftn5&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;325f&quot; id=&quot;325f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The same seems to apply to prohibitions –at least the prohibition of alcohol in the United States which led to interesting Mafia stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;16e6&quot; id=&quot;16e6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Let us conjecture that the formation of moral values in society doesn’t come from the evolution of the consensus. No, it is the most intolerant person who imposes virtue on others precisely because of that intolerance. The same can apply to civil rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f7af&quot; id=&quot;f7af&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;An insight as to how the mechanisms of religion and transmission of morals obey the same renormalization dynamics as dietary laws –and how we can show that morality is more likely to be something enforced by a minority. We saw earlier in the chapter the asymmetry between obeying and breaking rules: a law-abiding (or rule abiding) fellow always follows the rules, but a felon or someone with looser sets of principles will not &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; break the rules. Likewise we discussed the strong asymmetric effects of the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;halal&lt;/em&gt; dietary laws. Let us merge the two. It turns out that, in classical Arabic, the term &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;halal&lt;/em&gt; has one opposite: &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;haram&lt;/em&gt;. Violating legal and moral rules –any rule — is called &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;haram&lt;/em&gt;. It is the exact same interdict that governs food intake and &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; other human behaviors, like sleeping with the wife of the neighbor, lending with interest (without partaking of downside of the borrower) or killing one’s landlord for pleasure. &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Haram&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;haram&lt;/em&gt; and is asymmetric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e09e&quot; id=&quot;e09e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;From that we can see that once a moral rule is established, it would suffice to have a small intransigent minority of geographically distributed followers to dictate the norm in society. The sad news, as we will see in the next chapter, is that one person looking at mankind as an aggregate may mistakenly believe that humans are spontaneously becoming more moral, better, more gentle, have better breath, when it applies to only a small proportion of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;7a9a&quot; id=&quot;7a9a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The Stability of the Minority Rule, A Probabilistic Argument&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d6f2&quot; id=&quot;d6f2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;A probabilistic argument in favor of the minority rule dictating societal values is as follows. Wherever you look across societies and histories, you tend to find the same general moral laws prevailing, with some, but not significant, variations: &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;do not steal&lt;/em&gt; (at least not from within the tribe); &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;do not hunt orphans for pleasure; do not gratuitously beat up passers by for training, use instead a boxing bags&lt;/em&gt; (unless you are Spartan and even then you can only kill a limited number of helots for training purposes)&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; and similar interdicts. And we can see these rules evolving over time to become more universal, expanding to a broader set, to progressively include slaves, other tribes, other species (animals, economists), etc. And one property of these laws: they are black-and-white, binary, discrete, and allow no shadow. You cannot steal “a little bit” or murder “moderately”. You cannot keep Kosher and eat “just a little bit” of pork on Sunday barbecues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;845d&quot; id=&quot;845d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Now it would be vastly more likely that these values emerged from a minority that the majority. Why? Take the following two theses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6fe2&quot; id=&quot;6fe2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Outcomes are paradoxically more stable under the minority rule — the variance of the results is lower and the rule is more likely to be emerge independently across populations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4b4a&quot; id=&quot;4b4a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;What emerges from the minority rule is more likely to be be black-and-white.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;52bf&quot; id=&quot;52bf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;An example. Consider that an evil person wants to poison the collective by putting some product into soda cans. He has two options. The first is cyanide, which obeys a minority rule: a drop of poison (higher than a small threshold) makes the entire liquid poisonous. The second is a “majority”-style poison; it requires more than half the liquid to be poisonous in order to kill. Now look at the inverse problem, a collection of dead people after a dinner party, and you need to investigate the cause. The local Sherlock Holmes would assert that conditional on the outcome that &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;all people drinking the soda having been killed&lt;/em&gt;, the evil man opted for the first not the second option. Simply, the majority rule leads to fluctuations around the average, with a high rate of survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bbd5&quot; id=&quot;bbd5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The black-and-white character of these societal laws can be explained with the following. Assume that under a certain regime, when you mix white and dark blue in various combinations, you don’t get variations of light blue, but dark blue. Such a regime is vastly more likely to produce dark blue than another rule that allows more shades of blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;9ffb&quot; id=&quot;9ffb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Popper’s Paradox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0599&quot; id=&quot;0599&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I was at a large multi-table dinner party, the kind of situation where you have to choose between the vegetarian risotto and the non-vegetarian option when I noticed that my neighbor had his food catered (including silverware) on a tray reminiscent of airplane fare. The dishes were sealed with aluminum foil. He was evidently ultra-Kosher. It did not bother him to be seated with prosciutto eaters who, in addition, mix butter and meat in the same dishes. He just wanted to be left alone to follow his own preferences.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ac5a&quot; id=&quot;ac5a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;For Jews and Muslim minorities such as Shiites, Sufis, and associated religions such as Druze and Alawis, the aim is for people to leave them alone so they can satisfy their own dietary preferences –largely, with historical exceptions here and there. But had my neighbor been a Sunni Salafi, he would have required the entire room to be eating Halal. Perhaps the entire building. Perhaps the entire town. Hopefully the entire country. Hopefully the entire planet. Indeed, given the total lack of separation between church and state, and between the holy and the profane (Chapter x), to him Haram (the opposite of Halal) means literally illegal. The entire room was committing a legal violation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e5d6&quot; id=&quot;e5d6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As I am writing these lines, people are disputing whether the freedom of the enlightened West can be undermined by the intrusive policies that would be needed to fight fundamentalists.As I am writing these lines, people are disputing whether the freedom of the enlightened West can be undermined by the intrusive policies that would be needed to fight Salafi fundamentalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6ce3&quot; id=&quot;6ce3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Clearly can democracy –by definition the majority — tolerate enemies? The question is as follows: “ Would you agree to deny the freedom of speech to every political party that has in its charter the banning the freedom of speech?” Let’s go one step further, “Should a society that has elected to be tolerant be intolerant about intolerance?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;436c&quot; id=&quot;436c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This is in fact the incoherence that Kurt Gödel (the grandmaster of logical rigor) detected in the constitution while taking the naturalization exam. Legend has it that Gödel started arguing with the judge and Einstein, who was his witness during the process, saved him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5bce&quot; id=&quot;5bce&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I wrote about people with logical flaws asking me if one should be “skeptical about skepticism”; I used a similar answer as Popper when was asked if “ one could falsify falsification”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d0c7&quot; id=&quot;d0c7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We can answer these points using the minority rule. Yes, an intolerant minority can control and destroy democracy. Actually, as we saw, it &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; eventually destroy our world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;15bf&quot; id=&quot;15bf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So, we need to be more than intolerant with &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; intolerant minorities. It is not permissible to use “American values” or “Western principles” in treating intolerant Salafism (which denies other peoples’ right to have their own religion). The West is currently in the process of committing suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;7072&quot; id=&quot;7072&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The Irreverence of Markets and Science&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3ace&quot; id=&quot;3ace&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Now consider markets. We can say that markets aren’t the sum of market participants, but price changes reflect the activities of the most &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;motivated&lt;/em&gt; buyer and seller. Yes, the most motivated rules. Indeed this is something that only traders seem to understand: why a price can drop by ten percent because of a single seller. All you need is a stubborn seller. Markets react in a way that is disproportional to the impetus. The overall stock markets represent currently more than thirty trillions dollars but a single order in 2008, only fifty billion, that is less than two tenth of a percent of the total, caused them to drop by close to ten percent, causing losses of around three trillion. It was an order activated by the Parisian Bank Société Générale who discovered a hidden acquisition by a rogue trader and wanted to reverse the purchase. Why did the market react so disproportionately? Because the order was one-way –stubborn — there was desire to sell but no way to change one’s mind. My personal adage is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3f29&quot; id=&quot;3f29&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;The market is like a large movie theatre with a small door.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8115&quot; id=&quot;8115&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;And the best way to detect a sucker (say the usual finance journalist) is to see if his focus is on the size of the door or on that of the theater. Stampedes happen in cinemas, say when someone shouts “fire”, because those who want to be out do not want to stay in, exactly the same unconditionality we saw with Kosher observance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;41b0&quot; id=&quot;41b0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Science acts similarly. We will return later with a discussion of how the minority rule is behind Karl Popper’s approach to science. But let us for now discuss the more entertaining Feynman. &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;What do You Care What Other People Think?&lt;/em&gt; is the title of a book of anecdotes by the great Richard Feynman, the most irreverent and playful scientist of his day. As reflected in the title of the book, Feynman conveys in it the idea of the fundamental irreverence of science, acting through a similar mechanism as the Kosher asymmetry. How? Science isn’t the sum of what scientists think, but exactly as with markets, a procedure that is highly skewed. Once you debunk something, it is now wrong (that is how science operates but let’s ignore disciplines such as economics and political science that are more like pompous entertainment). Had science operated by majority consensus we would be still stuck in the Middle Ages and Einstein would have ended as he started, a patent clerk with fruitless side hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;77db&quot; id=&quot;77db&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ceea&quot; id=&quot;ceea&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Alexander said that it was preferable to have an army of sheep led by a lion to an army of lions led by a sheep. Alexander (or no doubt he who produced this probably apocryphal saying) understood the value of the active, intolerant, and courageous minority. Hannibal terrorized Rome for a decade and a half with a tiny army of mercenaries, winning twenty-two battles against the Romans, battles in which he was outnumbered each time. He was inspired by a version of this maxim. At the battle of Cannae, he remarked to Gisco who complained that the Carthaginians were outnumbered by the Romans: “There is one thing that’s more wonderful than their numbers … in all that vast number there is not one man called Gisgo.&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15#_ftn6&quot; data-href=&quot;#_ftn6&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15#_edn1&quot; data-href=&quot;#_edn1&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot;&gt;[i]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;a22b&quot; id=&quot;a22b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This large payoff from stubborn courage is not just in the military. The entire growth of society, whether economic or moral, comes from a small number of people. So we close this chapter with a remark about the role of skin in the game in the condition of society. Society doesn’t evolve by consensus, voting, majority, committees, verbose meeting, academic conferences, and polling; only a few people suffice to disproportionately move the needle. All one needs is an asymmetric rule somewhere. And asymmetry is present in about everything.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Washington:&lt;/strong&gt; While the Eastern United States simmers in some of its warmest February weather ever recorded, the Arctic is also stewing in temperatures 25 degrees above normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This latest huge temperature spike in the Arctic is another striking indicator of its rapidly transforming climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Arctic temperatures in February 2018 are averaging well above normal, and peaking up to 25 degrees higher than normal.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.fairfaxstatic.com.au/content/dam/images/h/0/w/i/5/q/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.p4z1bh.png/1519280297120.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arctic temperatures in February 2018 are averaging well above normal, and peaking up to 25 degrees higher than normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday and Tuesday, the northernmost weather station in the world, Cape Morris Jesup at the northern tip of Greenland, experienced more than 24 hours of temperatures above freezing according to the Danish Meteorological Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;How weird is that?&quot; tweeted Robert Rohde, a physicist at the University of California at Berkeley. &quot;Well it's Arctic winter. The sun set in October and won't be seen again until March. Perpetual night, but still above freezing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Perpetual night, but still above freezing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/aGkccjJd1g&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/aGkccjJd1g&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thaw occurred as a pulse of extremely mild air shot through the Greenland Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warm air is spilling into the Arctic from all sides. On the opposite end of North America, abnormally mild air also poured over northern Alaska on Tuesday, where the temperature in Utqiaġvik, previously known as Barrow, soared to a record high of -1 degree Celsius, which is 22 degrees above average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warmth over Alaska occurred as almost one-third of the ice covering the Bering Sea off Alaska's West Coast vanished in just over a week during the middle of February, InsideClimateNews reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temperatures over the entire Arctic north have averaged about 6 degrees above normal since the beginning of the calendar year, sometimes spiking over 14 degrees higher than usual. The normal temperature is around -30 Celsius).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These kinds of temperature anomalies in the Arctic have become commonplace in winter in the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;[T]he 'persistence' of the above average temperatures is quite striking,&quot; tweeted Zack Labe, a PhD candidate in climate science at the University of California at Irvine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the most extreme warmth of the year so far is forecast to flood the Arctic in coming days, with a number of areas seeing temperatures that might range from 25 to 34 degrees higher than normal. The mercury at the North Pole could well rise above freezing between Thursday and Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This next batch of abnormally warm air is forecast to shoot the gap between Greenland and northern Europe through the Greenland and Barents seas. Similar circumstances occurred in December 2016, when the temperature at the North Pole last flirted with the melting point in the dark, dead of winter. Similarly large jumps in temperature were documented in November 2016 and December 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An analysis from Climate Central said these extreme winter warming events in the Arctic, once rare, could become commonplace if the planet continues warming. A study in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; published in 2016 found the decline of sea ice in the Arctic &quot;is making it easier for weather systems to transport this heat polewards.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arctic sea ice was at its lowest extent on record this past January, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have sailed boats through [the Arctic Sea] but never this time of year,&quot; tweeted David Thoreson, an Arctic photographer. &quot;It's amazing to watch this unfold.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The record-setting temperatures and lack of ice is exactly what scientists have projected over the Arctic for years and it's fundamentally changing the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Arctic shows no sign of returning to reliably frozen region of recent past decades,&quot; NOAA concluded in its Arctic Report Card, published in December.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Eldar Black Holes</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino&quot;&gt;Neutrino&lt;/a&gt; are exotic subatomic particles whose existence was deduced when physicists noticed that the subatomic event called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_decay&quot;&gt;beta decay&lt;/a&gt; didn't add up. Mother Nature always balances her books, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_mass&quot;&gt;law of conservation of mass-energy&lt;/a&gt; forces that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Well, technically the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle&quot;&gt;Uncertainty principle&lt;/a&gt; allows one to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.physlink.com/Education/AskExperts/ae605.cfm&quot;&gt;embezzle mass-energy as long as you pay it back in the few nanoseconds before the cosmic accountant checks the ledger&lt;/a&gt;. But I digress.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with all nuclear reactions, the sum of all the starting particles mass-energy before the reaction must be exactly equal to the sum after. The problem with beta decay is that they weren't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1930 physicist &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Pauli&quot;&gt;Wolfgang Pauli&lt;/a&gt; said &lt;em&gt;&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino#Pauli.27s_proposal&quot;&gt;I've got it!&lt;/a&gt; What if beta decay produces some as-yet undiscovered weird &lt;em&gt;invisible&lt;/em&gt; particle with properties that will exactly balance the books? We just thought things were not balancing &lt;strong&gt;because we couldn't see the blasted thing&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other physicists rolled their eyes at Pauli. This sounded too much like your infant son telling you that he didn't break the lamp, it was an invisible green monster trying to frame him. Violates &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor&quot;&gt;Occam's razor&lt;/a&gt;, that does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-six years later Pauli was vindicated when Clyde Cowan and Frederick Reines &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowan%E2%80%93Reines_neutrino_experiment&quot;&gt;finally managed to detect the weird invisible particle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did it take them so long? Because neutrinos are &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; invisible. The slippery little devils can pass through about one entire light-year of solid lead before it hits a lead nucleus. They are beyond elusive, but can be detected by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino_detector&quot;&gt;sufficiently sensitive detector&lt;/a&gt;. These are typically 1,000 metric tons of ultra-pure water in a tank coated with photocells buried deep underground in an abandoned mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since neutrinos are so darn penetrating, they can be used to observe astronomical objects. In 1987 a couple of neutrino detectors accidentally spotted a few from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_1987A#Neutrino_emissions&quot;&gt;Supernova 1987A&lt;/a&gt;. The neutrinos arrived about two hours before the visible light of the supernova. This is because the neutrinos were created by the initial stellar core collapse, while the light was not created until two hours later when the shock-wave reached the star's surface. The important point is that neutrinos can be used to observe conditions inside the cores of stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which leads to this Weird Astronomical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1970 astrophysicists Raymond Davis, Jr. and John N. Bahcall figured they could use a neutrino detector to measure the rate of nuclear fusion in our primary star Sol. The Sun in our sky that gives us daylight. A single photon of light created by a fusion reaction in the core of Sol can take between 100,000 years and 50 million years to gradually work its way to the surface of Sol, then 8 minutes more to travel to Terra. But the slippery neutrino acts like the body of Sol ain't there. It takes a mere 2.3 seconds to reach the surface of Sol, and 8 minutes more to reach Terra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will allow a much more current report on the state of affairs at Sol's core. 2.3 seconds instead of 50 million years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Davis and Bahcall &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestake_experiment&quot;&gt;set up&lt;/a&gt; a 100,000 gallon tank of perchloroethylene 1,478 meters underground in the Homestake Gold Mine in Lead, South Dakota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bahcall had done the theoretical calculations on how many solar neutrinos would reach the detector. Davis used the detector to count the number of neutrinos that actually arrived. That's when all the fun started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble was that the actual number of neutrinos detected was consistently about &lt;strong&gt;one-third&lt;/strong&gt; the number predicted by Bahcall's calculations. Now, keep in mind that such trouble in Science is actually a good thing. Isaac Asimov noted &lt;em&gt;&quot;The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not '&lt;strong&gt;Eureka!&lt;/strong&gt;' (I found it!) but '&lt;strong&gt;That's funny ...&lt;/strong&gt;'&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Properly following the dictates of the scientific method, the scientific community immediately declared that either Davis, Bahcall, or both had made a mistake. Both Davis and Bahcall double checked their work, but could find no errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step in the scientific method is for others to try and recreate the experiment and recreate the experimental results. Kamiokande in Japan, SAGE in the former Soviet Union, GALLEX in Italy, Super Kamiokande, also in Japan, and SNO (Sudbury Neutrino Observatory) in Ontario, Canada all tried it. Lo and behold, they got the same results. There &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; only one-third of the predicted amount of neutrinos coming out of Sol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you ask the question &lt;em&gt;Why?&lt;/em&gt; is when things started getting edgy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two possibilities are: neutrinos are not understood as well as they thought or Sol is not understood as well as they thought. Or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nuclear physicists shrugged, and promised to take a closer look and neutrino theory to see if there was anything they'd overlooked. If they found anything, particle physics would be updated with the new information. No big deal, science marches on and all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The solar astronomers started to sweat.&lt;/strong&gt; The experimental results could mean that the rate of solar thermonuclear fusion had been drastically decreased by two-thirds. Which means the energy Terra receives from Sol could suddenly drop by two-thirds, at any moment from 50 million years in the future to eight minutes from now. The decrease would not be immediately apparent due to the 50 million year time lag of solar photons escaping the body of Sol. In that case the only question is how many millions of years in the past did the fusion rate stop?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course when the solar energy drops by two-thirds, Terra will die. Colder than a sno-cone in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niflheim&quot;&gt;Niflheim&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sir Arthur C. Clarke used this nifty situation as the background for his 1986 novel &lt;strong&gt;The Songs of Distant Earth&lt;/strong&gt;. And there were a few popularization of science articles published with arresting titles along the lines of &lt;strong&gt;SCIENTISTS ARE UNSURE IF THE SUN WILL RISE TOMORROW&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_neutrino_problem#Resolution&quot;&gt;situation was resolved&lt;/a&gt; 2001 when the results came in from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudbury_Neutrino_Observatory&quot;&gt;Sudbury Neutrino Observatory&lt;/a&gt; (SNO) in Canada, to the relief of astronomers and the dismay of science fiction authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since way back in the 1970's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model&quot;&gt;Standard Model of particle physics&lt;/a&gt; predicted that there were three kinds of neutrinos, ordinary garden-variety electron neutrinos plus the exotic muon neutrinos and tau neutrinos. Solar fusion produced electron neutrinos but none of the other two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clever readers will have already noticed the coincidence between the number of different neutrinos being three, and the neutrino detectors finding only one third of the expected number of solar neutrinos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 1957 &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Pontecorvo&quot;&gt;Bruno Pontecorvo&lt;/a&gt; proposed the theory of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino_oscillation&quot;&gt;Neutrino oscillation&lt;/a&gt;. It predicted that a neutrino of one type could spontaneously transmute into another type, then another type as it shot through space. This was an interesting conjecture, but it was not for decades that physicists could figure out an experiment which could detect this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally several experiments did. Ironically one of them was was the data from the previously mentioned Sudbury Neutrino Observatory looking for solar neutrinos. As it turns out, most of the other neutrino telescopes could only detect electron neutrinos but not the other two kinds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Super-Kamiokande collaboration in Japan produced evidence strongly suggesting that it was seeing cosmic-ray created muon neutrinos transmuting into tau neutrinos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the SNO used &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_water&quot;&gt;heavy water&lt;/a&gt; as the detection medium. This allowed it to detect &lt;strong&gt;all three types&lt;/strong&gt; of neutrinos. It could not distinguish between muon neutrinos and tau neutrinos, but it could see both. But it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; distinguish between electron neutrinos and the other two. In 2001 it showed that 35% of the arriving solar neutrinos are electron neutrinos, with the others being muon- or tau-neutrinos (invisible to most neutrino detectors). Notice that 35% is quite close to one-third. If the muon- and tau-neutrinos represented solar fusion electron neutrinos that had transmuted, then the rate of solar fusion was as predicted, and all's well with the world. Sol is not going to unexpectedly go &lt;em&gt;ppssssst!&lt;/em&gt;, turn dark, and condemn the world to an arctic death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, yet another thrilling science-fictional idea first offered by Science but then snatched away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;textcolor0&quot; readability=&quot;151.21052631579&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     More than a thousand years later, a great historian had called the period 1901-2000 ‘the Century when everything happened’. He added that the people of the time would have agreed with him —but for entirely the wrong reasons.&lt;br/&gt;     They would have pointed, often with justified pride, to the era’s scientific achievements — the conquest of the air, the release of atomic energy, the discovery of the basic principles of life, the electronics and communications revolution, the beginnings of artificial intelligence — and most spectacular of all, the exploration of the solar system and the first landing on the Moon. But as the historian pointed out, with the 20/20 accuracy of hindsight, not one in a thousand would even have heard of the discovery that transcended all these events by threatening to make them utterly irrelevant.&lt;br/&gt;     It seemed as harmless, and as far from human affairs, as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay#History_of_discovery&quot;&gt;fogged photographic plate in Becquerel’s laboratory&lt;/a&gt; that led, in only fifty years, to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki&quot;&gt;fireball above Hiroshima&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, it was a by-product of that same research, and began in equal innocence.&lt;br/&gt;     Nature is a very strict accountant, and always balances her books. So physicists were extremely puzzled when they discovered certain nuclear reactions in which, after all the fragments were added up, something seemed to be missing on one side of the equation.&lt;br/&gt;     Like a bookkeeper hastily replenishing the petty cash to keep one jump ahead of the auditors, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino#Pauli.27s_proposal&quot;&gt;the physicists were forced to invent a new particle&lt;/a&gt;. And, to account for the discrepancy, it had to be a most peculiar one — with neither mass nor charge, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.astronomynotes.com/starsun/s4.htm&quot;&gt;so fantastically penetrating that it could pass, without noticeable inconvenience, through a wall of lead billions of kilometres thick&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;     This phantom was given the nickname ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino&quot;&gt;neutrino&lt;/a&gt;’ — neutron plus &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambino&quot;&gt;bambino&lt;/a&gt;. There seemed no hope of ever detecting so elusive an entity; but &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Reines#Discovery_of_the_neutrino_and_the_inner_workings_of_stars&quot;&gt;in 1956, by heroic feats of instrumentation, the physicists had caught the first few specimens&lt;/a&gt;. It was also a triumph for the theoreticians, who now found their unlikely equations verified.&lt;br/&gt;     The world as a whole neither knew nor cared; but the countdown to doomsday had begun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;
     No one heard the first tolling of Earth’s funeral bell — &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestake_experiment&quot;&gt;not even the scientists who made the fatal discovery, far underground, in an abandoned Colorado gold mine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;     It was a daring experiment, quite inconceivable before the mid-twentieth century. Once the neutrino had been detected, it was quickly realized that mankind had a new window on the universe. Something so penetrating that it passed through a planet as easily as light through a sheet of glass could be used to look into the hearts of suns.&lt;br/&gt;     Especially the Sun. Astronomers were confident that they understood the reactions powering the solar furnace, upon which all life on Earth ultimately depended. At the enormous pressures and temperatures at the Sun’s core, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_neutrino_problem#Introduction&quot;&gt;hydrogen was fused to helium, in a series of reactions that liberated vast amounts of energy. And, as an incidental by-product, neutrinos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;     Finding the trillions of tons of matter in their way no more obstacle than a wisp of smoke, those solar neutrinos raced up from their birthplace at the velocity of light. Just two seconds later they emerged into space, and spread outward across the universe. However many stars and planets they encountered, most of them would still have evaded capture by the insubstantial ghost of ‘solid’ matter when Time itself came to an end.&lt;br/&gt;     Eight minutes after they had left the Sun, a tiny fraction of the solar torrent swept through the Earth — and an even smaller fraction was intercepted by the scientists in Colorado. They had buried their equipment more than a kilometre underground so that all the less penetrating radiations would be filtered out and they could trap the rare, genuine messengers from the heart of the Sun. By counting the captured neutrinos, they hoped to study in detail conditions at a spot that, as any philosopher could easily prove, was forever barred from human knowledge or observation.&lt;br/&gt;     The experiment worked; solar neutrinos were detected. But —there were far too few of them. There should have been three or four times as many as the massive instrumentation had succeeded in capturing.&lt;br/&gt;     Clearly, something was wrong, and during the 1970s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_neutrino_problem&quot;&gt;Case of the Missing Neutrinos&lt;/a&gt; escalated to a major scientific scandal. Equipment was checked and rechecked, theories were overhauled, and the experiment rerun scores of times — always with the same baffling result.&lt;br/&gt;     By the end of the twentieth century, the astrophysicists had been forced to accept a disturbing conclusion — though as yet, no one realized its full implications.&lt;br/&gt;     There was nothing wrong with the theory, or with the equipment. &lt;strong&gt;The trouble lay inside the Sun.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The first secret meeting in the history of the International Astronomical Union took place in 2008 at Aspen, Colorado — not far from the scene of the original experiment, which had now been repeated in a dozen countries. A week later IAU Special Bulletin No. 55/08, bearing the deliberately low-key title ‘Some Notes on Solar Reactions’, was in the hands of every government on Earth.&lt;p class=&quot;textemp&quot;&gt;(ed note: the novel was written in 1986, then the year 2008 was two decades in the future)&lt;/p&gt;
     One might have thought that as the news slowly leaked out, the announcement of the End of the World would have produced a certain amount of panic. In fact, the general reaction was a stunned silence — then a shrug of the shoulders and the resumption of normal, everyday business.&lt;br/&gt;     Few governments had ever looked more than an election ahead, few individuals beyond the lifetimes of their grandchildren. And anyway, the astronomers might be wrong. Even if humanity was under sentence of death, the date of execution was still indefinite. The Sun would not blow up for at least a thousand years, and who could weep for the fortieth generation?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;descriptor&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/span&gt; We describe a method for deepening a student's understanding of basic physics by asking the student to express physical ideas in a functional programming language. The method is implemented in a second-year course in computational physics at Lebanon Valley College. We argue that the structure of Newtonian mechanics is clarified by its expression in a language (Haskell) that supports higher-order functions, types, and type classes. In electromagnetic theory, the type signatures of functions that calculate electric and magnetic fields clearly express the functional dependency on the charge and current distributions that produce the fields. Many of the ideas in basic physics are well-captured by a type or a function.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: Mitmproxy 3.0 released, an open-source console-based proxy</title>
<link>https://mitmproxy.org/posts/releases/mitmproxy3/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://mitmproxy.org/posts/releases/mitmproxy3/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We’re delighted to announce the release of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/releases/latest&quot;&gt;mitmproxy v3.0&lt;/a&gt;. This is a massive milestone release, featuring a substantial revamp of mitmproxy’s internal structure and serious improvements in all tools across the board. Everyone should update!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project’s momentum remains fearsome: this release features 1235 commits by 56 contributors, resulting in 287 closed issues and 308 merged PRs. With this release, we’re also launching a new website (you’re looking at it), a new project blog (you’re reading this release notice on it), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitmproxy.org/docs/latest&quot;&gt;cleaner docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s dig into the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;internals&quot;&gt;Internals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitmproxy now has a powerful new &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitmproxy.org/docs/latest/addons-overview/&quot;&gt;addon infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;. Addons can hook into mitmproxy’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitmproxy.org/docs/latest/addons-events/&quot;&gt;internal events&lt;/a&gt;, can expose &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitmproxy.org/docs/latest/addons-options&quot;&gt;typed options&lt;/a&gt; for configuration, and can create &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitmproxy.org/docs/latest/addons-events/&quot;&gt;typed commands&lt;/a&gt; for user interaction. We’ve migrated much of mitmproxy’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/tree/master/mitmproxy/addons&quot;&gt;own functionality into a set of internal addons&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in a much cleaner and more maintainable code structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most exciting aspect of this change is the power it gives third-party addons and user scripts. We expose precisely the same functionality mitmproxy uses for itself to users. Typed options declared by addons automatically appear in type-aware options editors in the official tools, are automatically included in configuration files, and can automatically be controlled from the command line. Typed commands exposed by addons get tab completion in mitmproxy console for free, and can be bound to keys. If you’re working on an extension of mitmproxy, please let us know - mitmproxy addons are now more powerful and easier to write than ever, and we’d like your feedback to help us make them better still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mitmproxy-console&quot;&gt;Mitmproxy console&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitmproxy.org/posts/releases/mitmproxy3/mitmproxy-v3.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mitmproxy console app has been rebuilt around the new addon mechanism. Every user interaction and key binding simply invokes an addon command. Keystrokes can be bound directly to commands, and the command language can be invoked from an interactive, smart, syntax-aware prompt. User addons and scripts are first-class citizens, and get the same tab completion, type-aware options editor and key binding support as builtins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction of &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitmproxy.org/docs/latest/concepts-commands&quot;&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt; makes mitmproxy a massively more flexible and powerful tool. Any operation on flows can be invoked from the command prompt and combined with flow selectors. So, for instance, we can replay all flows with the domain “google.com” like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://mitmproxy.org/posts/releases/mitmproxy3/command-example.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with this comes many, many user interface improvements. Major changes include horizontal and vertical multi-pane layouts, customizable keybindings, an options editor, and a command palette. There are too many minor improvements to list, but my personal favourite is the new “B” keybinding (the &lt;code&gt;browser.start&lt;/code&gt; command), which opens an isolated instance of Chrome automatically set up to go through the running proxy. Very handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mitmweb-protocol-support-and-others&quot;&gt;Mitmweb, protocol support and others&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, there are many other improvements in this release. Mitmweb, the mitmproxy web interface, has continued to mature with a new options editor, and many other improvements. This will open a slew of new use cases for our toolset down the track. Mitmproxy’s content views - including the beautifiers for JavaScript and CSS and image summary viewers - are now faster and better. Our underlying protocol support has improved, with a better websockets stack and the introduction of request streaming for HTTP1 and HTTP2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a complete list of changes, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/master/CHANGELOG&quot;&gt;CHANGELOG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;gsoc&quot;&gt;GSoC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of special note during this release cycle is the work of our two brilliant &lt;a href=&quot;https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/&quot;&gt;Google Summer of Code 2017&lt;/a&gt; students, who participated in mitmproxy’s development under the umbrella of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.honeynet.org/&quot;&gt;Honeynet Project&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/matthewshao&quot;&gt;Matthew Shao&lt;/a&gt; made major improvements to the mitmproxy web interface, including adding a new options editor, vastly improving our testing, and working on a static web viewer for mitmproxy dumps. Matthew wrote a detailed blog about his work on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://honeynet.org/node/1359&quot;&gt;HoneyNet blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ujjwal96&quot;&gt;Ujjwal Verma&lt;/a&gt; pushed our content views and protocol layers ahead very significantly. You can thank him for faster, more stable decoding of images, protobufs, and better prettifying of JavaScript and CSS. He also migrated our websockets implementation to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/python-hyper/wsproto&quot;&gt;wsproto&lt;/a&gt;, and added request streaming to HTTP1 and HTTP2. We look forward to working with both Matthew and Ujjwal in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you a student and interested in working on mitmproxy? Take a look at our &lt;a href=&quot;https://honeynet.org/gsoc2018/ideas&quot;&gt;GSoC 2018 page&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;survey&quot;&gt;Survey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitmproxy doesn’t have telemetry and collects as little data as possible on its users. We rely on your manual feedback to let us know what to build. Please take a moment to fill in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/forms/Or2mwRtcG5h8yr813&quot;&gt;2018 mitmproxy user survey&lt;/a&gt; - this feeds directly into our dev priorities for the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Practice is not the Performance: Why project-based learning fails</title>
<link>http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/02/the-practice-is-not-performance-why.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/02/the-practice-is-not-performance-why.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Last night, I encountered an &lt;a href=&quot;https://zachholman.com/2011/02/graduated-with-a-major-in-startups/&quot;&gt;old post&lt;/a&gt; by Zach Holman where he pushes the idea that traditional school-based CS is useless; project-based learning is the way to go. I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.codinghorror.com/how-should-we-teach-computer-science/&quot;&gt;heard&lt;/a&gt; this idea &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.is/1BqTf&quot;&gt;repeatedly&lt;/a&gt; over the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2008/01/08/undergraduate-programming/&quot;&gt;last 10 years&lt;/a&gt;, and know at least one person who’s started an education company with that premise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to debate the current way universities do things (I found my undergrad quite useful, thank you), but I do want to dispel the idea that everything would be better if only we switched to project-based learning. The opposite is closer to true. Project-based learning is not a superior new idea. Project-based learning is the most inefficient form of learning that still works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see why, we actually have to sit down and think about the learning process. I’ve learned a number of models of learning over the course of my teaching training, but the one I’ve found most useful is taught by the Center for Applied Rationality. It goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Break down a skill into small components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drill each component rapidly, with immediate feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate the pieces together into larger components; drill these similarly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that light, project-based learning definitely has something going for it: if you do a project, you will practice all the skills needed to do projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s something missing, though: it completely gives up on trying to think about what components it’s trying to teach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how project-based learning might play out: After finishing his first two Android apps, Bob decides he wants to learn network programming, and generally get better at working on a software team. He and Alice pair up and decide to build a chat app for sending cat gifs, with a distributed replicated backend. They decide to make a spreadsheet of tasks and claim them. Alice also wants to learn network programming, and she swoops in and takes most of the server components; Bob gets left with most of the client work. Over the next three weeks, Bob spends a lot of time building the GUI for the app, which he already knows how to do, and only a couple hours implementing the client protocol. They start writing tests because the teacher said they had to. Bob has trouble writing the tests, and realizes a couple ways he could have made his code differently to make testing easier. He also discovers that two of his tests were too fragile, and needed to be changed when he updated the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s now one month later. What has he gotten from the experience? He's learned he needed to be more proactive about taking on tasks that challenge him and grow his skills. He’s learned a smidgeon about network programming, and a couple ideas about how to write better tests. These are good lessons, sure, but expensive. Isn’t there a way for Bob to learn more in that month?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;False Temptations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the common arguments in favor of project-based learning? Here are two of the main ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Real skills&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first big reason for project-based learning is that it teaches real skills used in industry. Why do many schools teach much of their curriculum in Haskell, not in the Tiobe Top 10, or even SML or OCaml, not even in the top 50? Wouldn’t they serve their graduates better teaching Node and React?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first counterargument is that industrial technologies come and go. Proponents acknowledge this, sure, but still call CS departments “out of date” for not following trends. What really drove home the futility of this argument for me was &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3ce8/47852c84c8ffa3c25beb6955f186517c70d8.pdf&quot;&gt;this essay&lt;/a&gt; by software-engineering pioneer Mary Shaw. Had she followed that advice in the 60s, she points out, her students would have spent their time studying &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_Control_Language&quot;&gt;JCL&lt;/a&gt;, the language used to schedule jobs on IBM mainframes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second and bigger counterargument: learning concepts is much more important than learning applications, and the best environment to learn a concept is rarely the one in industrial demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often ask me what’s the best language to learn to study software design. I ask them what’s the best instrument to learn to study music theory. Everyone answers piano. In piano, you can see the chords in a way that you can’t in, say, trombone. We see something similar in other domains. In The Art of Learning, Josh Waitzkin recounts how, unlike others, he started studying chess at the fundamentals, in situations with few pieces on the board. He ultimately beat competitors who studied many times harder. In The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses, Jesse Schell advocates looking past modern video games and instead studying the concepts in board games, dice games, playground games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for programming, we need to (1) figure out the core concepts to teach, and (2) pick languages that make the concepts readily available. C and Java --- indeed, all top languages until Swift arrived --- lack elegant ways of expressing the idea of a sum, a value that can be one of many alternatives. Thus, when explaining why adding a new alternative sometimes breaks existing code and sometimes doesn’t, I find myself having to explain using the clumsy manifestations as unions and subclasses. The first time I read Bob Harper’s explanation of why they chose SML for the CMU undergraduate curriculum, I thought he was just rationalizing snobbery. Now, I quite agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;More like real jobs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second big argument for project-based learning is that it more closely resembles what students will actually do on the job. This, in turn, is based on the idea that the best way to practice an activity is to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is false. “The only way to improve at X is to do it” is the advice you give when you actually have no idea how to improve. When you do know, you isolate subskills and drill them. Martial artists punch bags and do kata, and fight with extra constraints like no dodging. Musicians play scales, and practice a single measure over and over. Mathematicians rederive theorems from the book. And to condition a shot-putter, the best way is not to put weights in their hands and have them mimic the throwing motion, but rather to train the body’s ability to produce power, using squats and lots of heavy exercises that don’t even resemble shot-putting.&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/02/the-practice-is-not-performance-why.html#1&quot; name=&quot;top1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Drilling programming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what am I advocating? I’m advocating that you actually think about what you’re trying to teach, and design drills for it. The first drills should focus on one thing at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for Bob trying to learn network programming and the general software engineering skills of being on a team project, here’s my 5-minute attempt to come up with an alternative way to teach these skills:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Writing just the networking component of a larger system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being asked to write the test cases for a small program given to you. The program is deliberately designed to tempt you into all the classic mistakes of test-writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A simulation where you “coordinate” with the TAs to build something, committing pseudocode to version control. They troll you by deliberately misunderstanding things you say and seeing if their misunderstanding can go undetected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You and several teammates are assigned a small project. You’re asked to divide it amongst yourselves into unrealistically small units of work, and write test cases for each other’s components. (Integrates the skills of 2 and 3.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;These total much less time than the chat app, and teach much more. If students find they’re not optimal for learning, I as the instructor have much more room for experimenting. And if the students do choose to do a full project afterwards, they’ll be much more prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t teach network programming and haven’t tested these specific ideas. But, in my specialty of software design and code quality, I use exercises built on similar principles all the time. So I may teach a client some of the pitfalls of a naive understanding of information hiding, and then show them code from a real project that has that problem and ask them how they’d solve it. Or I’ll ask them to give just the type definitions and method signatures for a Minesweeper game; if they violate any design principles, then I can give them a feature request they can’t handle, or show why the implementation will be prone to bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it better than just assigning projects? That’s the wrong question to ask because project-based learning is incredibly easy to beat. My clients are mostly working professional software engineers; they’re already doing “project-based learning” every day. On &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jameskoppelcoaching.com/&quot;&gt;my website&lt;/a&gt;, I claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programmers learn by making bad design decisions, working on the codebase for a year, and then find themselves wishing they could go back and do things differently. I can give you that experience in an hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this sound like a bold statement about my teaching prowess? It’s not. In fact, piano teachers put that claim to shame. You can spend hundreds of hours practicing a piece using &lt;a href=&quot;http://fundamentals-of-piano-practice.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chapter1/ch1_procedures/II.14.html&quot;&gt;too many muscles on every key press&lt;/a&gt;. If your body awareness isn’t great, you might not find out until your hand cramps up right before your performance. A couple seconds to catch that mistake, a couple minutes to tell you a story of that happening to others, and the piano teacher’s just saved you months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As an aside, this is why I believe in finding a competent private coach for every skill you really care about improving in.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replacing a traditional CS education with a “software engineering BFA,” like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2008/01/08/undergraduate-programming/&quot;&gt;Spoelsky&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.codinghorror.com/how-should-we-teach-computer-science/&quot;&gt;Atwood&lt;/a&gt; suggest, is no longer a hypothetical exercise. We’ve tried it. And now dev bootcamps are going bankrupt. Instead of substituting for a traditional degree, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-12-06/want-a-job-in-silicon-valley-keep-away-from-coding-schools&quot;&gt;recruiters are calling bootcamps jokes&lt;/a&gt;. Olin College of Engineering is famous for its project-based curriculum, but one student &lt;a href=&quot;http://franklyspeakingnews.com/2014/02/criticism-of-project-learning/&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that she learned much more from traditional classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s time to stop looking for panaceas and shortcuts and realize that deliberate learning and deliberate practice --- as a separate activity from the everyday doing --- is the only way to mastery. As famed gymnastics coach Chris Sommer puts it, the fastest way to learn is to do things the slow way. Studying the fundamentals may seem like a distraction keeping you from getting your hands dirty making a Rails app using the Google Maps and Twilio APIs, but when you do get there, you’ll find there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.bradfieldcs.com/in-2017-learn-every-language-59b11f68eee&quot;&gt;less to learn&lt;/a&gt; if you’ve already &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/Do-grad-school-students-remember-everything-they-were-taught-in-college-all-the-time&quot;&gt;compressed the knowledge&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=&quot;http://lesswrong.com/lw/la/truly_part_of_you/&quot;&gt;concepts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Shameless Plug&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;http://jameskoppelcoaching.com/advanced-software-design-web-course/&quot;&gt;Advanced Software Design Web Course&lt;/a&gt; starts next week. It’s based on a lot of the learning principles I mentioned in this post, starting each concept with isolated drills and progressing to case studies from real software, and comes with personalized feedback from me on every assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;No, the sum total of knowledge about CS education is not to be found within this post. Yes, I do have some formal training in education; yes, other people have a lot more. Yes, there are a lot of things I didn’t bring up. Yes, the situation with bootcamps is more complicated than a simple referendum on project-based learning. The simple “turbocharging training” model of learning I gave is not a theory of everything. Yes, you need to run into problems in context, find motivation, try things out of order, and even eventually do a full project on a team without guidance. I believe realistic projects do have a place in education, but they still must be coupled with the principles of rapid feedback, and they are a poor substitute for learning the concepts piece-by-piece.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Acknowledgments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thanks to Elliott Jin for comments on earlier drafts of this post.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

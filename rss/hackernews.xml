&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’re aware of Netflix. Maybe you even have a subscription for their services. You might have also heard of or watched a series called &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;, produced by Netflix. But did you know that Netflix has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.target.com/p/-/A-52823816?lnk=Season1BlurayDV&amp;amp;clkid=1807817bN50a95209963b431df937f3b0&amp;amp;lnm=81938&amp;amp;afid=Skimbit%20Ltd.&amp;amp;ref=tgt_adv_xasd0002&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;selling a Collector’s Edition box set&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; that incorporates pictures from my webpage, &lt;a href=&quot;http://goughlui.com/the-vhs-corner/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The VHS Corner&lt;/a&gt;? I didn’t, until some kind netizens contacted me to tell me all about it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Tip-Off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was contacted at 7:56 am on November 5th, 2017, by the operator of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwMCfqdbS2PxHIFcwgIlcag&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;discjunkietv&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube. He reported posting a video online about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.target.com/p/-/A-52823816?lnk=Season1BlurayDV&amp;amp;clkid=1807817bN50a95209963b431df937f3b0&amp;amp;lnm=81938&amp;amp;afid=Skimbit%20Ltd.&amp;amp;ref=tgt_adv_xasd0002&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; Season 1 Target-exclusive Special Edition Blu-Ray Box Set&lt;/a&gt; and that a commenter (DVD and Film Bloke) had recognized that the images on the inner box resembling a VHS cassette are taken from my &lt;a href=&quot;http://goughlui.com/the-vhs-corner/intro-inside-the-vhs-cassette-vcr/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Intro – Inside the VHS Cassette &amp;amp; VCR&lt;/a&gt; page. After a quick confirmation, he decided to contact me about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Proof&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the help of discjunkietv, I had good quality images of the inner box. Initially, I only knew that the top-side had been taken, but it turns out that the underside was also sourced from my website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/box-cropped-800x533.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-295315&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/box-cropped-800x533.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/box-cropped-320x213.jpg 320w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/box-cropped-450x300.jpg 450w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/box-cropped-300x200.jpg 300w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/box-cropped-120x80.jpg 120w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/box-cropped.jpg 1278w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;The cover design of the Stranger Things collector’s edition boxed set. &lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/DSC_1864-800x444.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;444&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-295320&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/DSC_1864-800x444.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/DSC_1864-320x178.jpg 320w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/DSC_1864.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;My photo of a VHS cassette.
&lt;p&gt;Note the identical dirt in the flip-open tape cover, identical molding defect in the top-left area, identical reel positioning, and reflections. The image had been altered to fit the desired aspect ratio through cloning several rows of the pattern in both top and bottom areas, with the bottom corner filled in. They have also added their own “faux” labels on top of the center portion and right reel window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/bottom-face.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;568&quot; height=&quot;370&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-295317&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/bottom-face.jpg 568w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/bottom-face-320x208.jpg 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px&quot;/&gt;The back design of the boxed set. &lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/backside-800x444.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;444&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-295319&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/backside-800x444.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/backside-320x178.jpg 320w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/backside.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;My photo of a VHS cassette.
&lt;p&gt;Note the virtually identical image down to the offset of the reel-hubs in their respective apertures. Again, some modifications were made to fit the desired aspect ratio, but the images are essentially identical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/spine-face.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;660&quot; height=&quot;120&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-295321&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/spine-face.jpg 660w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/spine-face-320x58.jpg 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/edge-face.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;540&quot; height=&quot;134&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-295322&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/edge-face.jpg 540w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/edge-face-320x79.jpg 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I could not identify the source of the spine and side images based on the given pictures, however, it seems at least that the side may not have come from my website directly. It does bear resemblance to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://goughlui.com/the-vhs-corner/vhs-cassette-library/fuji-ag/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Fuji AG grade&lt;/a&gt; cassette side which I had imaged at an oblique angle. These may not be my images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As proof that I am the originator of the said images, here are two screenshots showing the metadata from the raw NEF from the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/metadata-800x775.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;775&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-295323&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/metadata-800x775.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/metadata-320x310.jpg 320w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/metadata.jpg 946w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/metadata2-800x780.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;780&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-295324&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/metadata2-800x780.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/metadata2-320x312.jpg 320w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/metadata2.jpg 938w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a double-check, a friend sent a link &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/10/17/stranger-things-gets-coolest-home-video-target/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;to photos posted by Jeremy Konrad&lt;/a&gt; as independent verification of the images above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a later date, I was also informed that the upcoming 4k UHD release with different outer-cover art will also have an inner box using the same base images, as shown in &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/gallery/5NFYE&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;this Imgur gallery by rpvee&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Reaction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I was in disbelief for two reasons. I’ve not watched &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;, but I’ve heard a lot of good things about it. Could it be true that my work has become a part of their product and I should be so honored to be part of it? The images I were seeing did not lie. They were my photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it turned into a feeling of betrayal. How could they, a large corporate company with day-to-day experience in handling rights-protected materials, use my material without so much as asking me for permission? How did they think they can get away with it? I’ll admit, I’m not a lawyer, but I do have a moral right to copyright over the images I take that does not require any registration. At the least, they have chosen my images because they are somehow special (e.g. well taken, high resolution), and I deserve to be compensated for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Attempted Contact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 9:08 am on the same day I learned all of this, I set about trying to contact Netflix about it. Contacting Netflix is hardly an easy task as no e-mail addresses are available, so I had to resort to live-chat to try and get to someone who can help. This was a long process, as it took about 10-15 minutes for the customer service representative to find the necessary contact details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You: I would like to contact your distribution department, as I have been made aware that the image of a VHS cassette used on the Target-exclusive Stranger Things Season 1 Collector’s Edition Blu-Ray is my image from my website (goughlui.com) and the image was used without my consent or permission.I would like to know how this came to happen, why I was not made aware of this and appropriate licensing sought prior to publication. Sincerely,Dr. Gough Lui&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shelton Netflix&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you Dr. Lui for letting us know about this concern , your opinion is very important for us,please, bear with me one minute so I can get you the right information about who to contact so we can get this solved for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shelton Netflix&lt;/strong&gt;: So welcome!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shelton Netflix&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you so much for you time and patience, I’m still retrieving the right information for you so you can get your concern clarify. one more minute please.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&lt;/strong&gt;: No problems. Understood :).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shelton Netflix&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you once again for your time, I did research about your concern and since we are not able to handle this issue over the chat I found the right department that can surely better assist you so you can get all the responses about this inconvenience, please address your concern to **************.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shelton Netflix&lt;/strong&gt;: And once again I apologize for this issues 🙁&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&lt;/strong&gt;: Thanks for the information. In the future, it would be easier if an e-mail address of some sort could be more prominently available under your contact details so I don’t have to “bother someone” to find it for me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&lt;/strong&gt;: Thanks again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shelton Netflix&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you muc for having the time to reach out to us, and will pass that feedback also. Have a great weekend&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shelton Netflix&lt;/strong&gt;: And one more thing, if you wouldn’t mind, please stay online for a one question survey.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being given the e-mail address for the Public Relations team, I sent off this e-mail at 9:29 am:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;44.923900789177&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Netflix,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been made aware that your recently-released Target-exclusive Stranger Things Season 1 Blu-Ray Collector’s Edition Box features a prominent image of a VHS cassette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Inline Image – Same as in Proof Section Above]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has come to my attention through a number of fans of Stranger Things that the prominent image featured is my image that I had photographed and published on my personal website, specifically on [&lt;a href=&quot;http://goughlui.com/the-vhs-corner/intro-inside-the-vhs-cassette-vcr/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt;]. As a VHS aficionado, I have posted some of the better quality images available online which are frequent targets of image theft. I was not contacted about its use, nor was any licensing of the image sought. Given the prominent copyright notice printed in the footer on each page, I assert my moral right to copyright over this image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Inline Image – Same as in Proof Section Above]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When compared with my image, note the reflection in both VHS reel windows, dirt in the VHS cover lid and “chip” in the patterning on the left side, all of which coincide at a level beyond just mere coincidence to indicate this image is indeed the one I had taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case of dispute, I do have the original un-edited RAW and JPG files, whose metadata is displayed below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Inline Image – Same as in Proof Section Above]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you are in the content production industry, the concept of copyright would not be foreign to you. I would like to know, specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who made the decision to use my image without permission, attribution nor contact?&lt;br/&gt;Who approved the artwork without reviewing any rights materials?&lt;br/&gt;How you propose to remedy this situation, as I am sure the discs themselves would see sizeable circulation for which I have not received any compensation for my efforts.&lt;br/&gt;I look forward to your co-operative response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gough Lui&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this was sent outside their regular operating hours, I didn’t expect an immediate reply, however, I did get an autoresponder at 9:50 am:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your message. If this is press-related, we do our best to respond to most media requests within a few hours. Please note: we do not monitor this inbox during weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your matter is regarding customer service, please refer to help.netflix.com for alternative contact information. We do not respond to customer service related issues through this email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is regarding a sponsorship request, someone will contact you if it’s of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are submitting a film for consideration: unfortunately, we do not accept or review unsolicited materials or ideas. For that reason, we will not consider any materials or ideas we receive that were not specifically requested by Netflix or submitted via an aggregator or established agent through the appropriate channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix PR Team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s clear from this reply that their system had received the e-mail. As a result, I sat and waited a few days. No reply was forthcoming. As a result, at 11:06 am on 8th November, I sent the following message (including a CC to my alternate e-mail address in case replies were lost):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Netflix,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was given this contact by your customer service team as the best contact to use, but I have not heard back from you in regards to my inquiry. Could you please acknowledge whether this inquiry is being handled, and as to the progress or whether there is a more appropriate contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has since come to my attention that the images used on the other sides of the collector’s edition box are also my images which were taken without obtaining permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would hope not to have to post an article on my website and go through social media channels to reach a resolution to this matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gough Lui&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message was successfully received on my alternate e-mail address, so the send did complete and no postmaster warnings were returned. However, it’s been over two weeks since my initial e-mail, and yet no reply has been entertained. It seems I am being ignored. As a result, I’ve had to do what I hate most — turn it into a social media “thing”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Happens Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am hoping that by making this public posting, at least this injustice is documented, with the hope that it catches the eye of someone responsible enough to look into the matter and offer appropriate compensation. When and if that happens, the record will be updated accordingly. Image licenses can frequently run up to $600 per image depending on use. In the case where people are not contacted beforehand, an additional penalty is considered customary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course, I have no ill intentions. I have no intention to ask them to stop selling the items. In fact, I’m happy people are nostalgic about VHS. I’m not looking to milk the situation at all. I’m not threatening to get a lawyer on their case. I’m just frustrated that I had to find out from someone else in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m frustrated that despite my photos being used, I’m not getting any compensation whatsoever. I’m frustrated that I have to spend time chasing when I could be spending time doing something else. I’m extremely frustrated that the piece of art they have produced resides on a box set which I cannot even hold in my own hands, as it’s US-only. I’m half-way around the world in Australia, so did they think they could get away with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topping it all off, once I tried to contact them via the means they have advised me to use, I was ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been unemployed for a while, on holidays for a while, making do as best as I can. I’m a one-man-band operating a personal blog that doesn’t even make AU$1/day after all the hosting and domain fees are considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not an unreasonable person – all I ask for is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;An apology and an explanation of how this happened, and what you’re doing about it. Maybe there is something I don’t know? If there is, then let me know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A reasonable license fee as a way to contribute to my work. This would go towards offsetting the cost of equipment and vast amount of time I’ve spent on my blog. I leave the monetary amount open to negotiation, but I’m trusting that you will at least be reasonable. You’re using my images on work that is being sold for profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A physical copy of the items in question. It’s not particularly nice to have your work used on something that you can’t even hold in your own hands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, for a company that had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/17/15327840/netflix-earnings-report-q1-2017-subscribers-quarterly-release&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Quarter 1 profit in 2017 of $178 million&lt;/a&gt;, what I’m asking for is not even a rounding error.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Woman offers WaPo false tale about Roy Moore in effort to discredit the paper</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content inline-video&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;inline-video-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;Reporter Stephanie McCrummen of The Washington Post interviews Jaime Phillips at a Greek restaurant in Alexandria on Wednesday. (Dalton Bennett,Thomas LeGro/The Washington Post)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman who falsely claimed to The Washington Post that Roy Moore, the Republican U.S. Senate candidate in Alabama, impregnated her as a teenager appears to work with an organization that uses deceptive tactics to secretly record conversations in an effort to embarrass its targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a series of interviews over two weeks, the woman shared a dramatic story about an alleged sexual relationship with Moore in 1992 that led to an abortion when she was 15. During the interviews, she repeatedly pressed Post reporters to give their opinions on the effects that her claims could have on Moore’s candidacy if she went public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Post did not publish an article based on her unsubstantiated account. When Post reporters confronted her with inconsistencies in her story and an Internet posting that raised doubts about her motivations, she insisted that she was not working with any organization that targets journalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on Monday morning, Post reporters saw her walking into the New York offices of Project Veritas, an organization that targets the mainstream news media and left-leaning groups. The organization sets up undercover “stings” that involve using false cover stories and covert video recordings meant to expose what the group says is media bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James O’Keefe, the Project Veritas founder who was convicted of a misdemeanor in 2010 for using a fake identity to enter a federal building during a previous sting, declined to answer questions about the woman outside the organization’s offices on Monday morning shortly after the woman walked inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am not doing an interview right now, so I’m not going to say a word,” O’Keefe said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content inline-video&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;inline-video-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;James O’Keefe, the founder of Project Veritas, declined to answer questions from The Post. (Aaron Davis/The Washington Post)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a follow-up interview, O’Keefe declined to answer repeated questions about whether the woman was employed at Project Veritas. He also did not respond when asked if he was working with Moore, former White House adviser and Moore supporter Stephen K. Bannon, or Republican strategists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group’s efforts illustrate the lengths to which activists have gone to try to discredit media outlets for reporting on allegations from multiple women that Moore pursued them when they were teenagers and he was in his early 30s. Moore has denied that he did anything improper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Moore’s campaign did not respond to a message seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman who approached Post reporters, Jaime T. Phillips, did not respond to calls to her cellphone later Monday. Her car remained in the Project Veritas parking lot for more than an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Post positioned videographers outside the group’s office in Mamaroneck, N.Y, after determining that Phillips lives in Stamford, Conn., and realizing that the two locations were just 16 miles apart. Two reporters followed her from her home as she drove to the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Phillips was observed entering the Project Veritas office, The Post made the unusual decision to report her previous off-the-record comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We always honor ‘off-the-record’ agreements when they’re entered into in good faith,” said Martin Baron, The Post’s executive editor. “But this so-called off-the-record conversation was the essence of a scheme to deceive and embarrass us. The intent by Project Veritas clearly was to publicize the conversation if we fell for the trap. Because of our customary journalistic rigor, we weren’t fooled, and we can’t honor an ‘off-the-record’ agreement that was solicited in maliciously bad faith.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillips’s arrival at the Project Veritas office capped a weeks-long effort that began only hours after The Post published an article on Nov. 9 that included allegations that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/woman-says-roy-moore-initiated-sexual-encounter-when-she-was-14-he-was-32/2017/11/09/1f495878-c293-11e7-afe9-4f60b5a6c4a0_story.html?utm_term=.ca2d4b7a348f&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;Moore once initiated a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old named Leigh Corfman&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post reporter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/beth-reinhard/?utm_term=.66b196b39300&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;Beth Reinhard&lt;/a&gt;, who co-wrote the article about Corfman, received a cryptic email early the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Roy Moore in Alabama . . . I might know something but I need to keep myself safe. How do we do this?” the apparent tipster wrote under an account with the name “Lindsay James.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The email’s subject line was “Roy Moore in AL.” The sender’s email address included “rolltide,” the rallying cry of the University of Alabama’s sports teams, which are nicknamed the Crimson Tide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reinhard sent an email asking if the person was willing to talk off the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not sure if I trust the phone,” came the reply. “Can we just stick to email?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I need to be confident that you can protect me before I will tell all,” the person wrote in a subsequent email. “I have stuff I’ve been hiding for a long time but maybe it should stay that way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tipster’s email came amid counterattacks by Moore supporters aimed at The Post and its reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That same day, Gateway Pundit, a conservative site, spread a false story from a Twitter account, @umpire43, that said, “A family friend in Alabama just told my wife that a WAPO reporter named Beth offer her 1000$ to accuse Roy Moore.” The Twitter account, which has a history of spreading misinformation, has since been deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Post, like many other news organizations, has a strict policy against paying people for information and did not do so in its coverage of Moore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Nov. 14, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/11/14/alabama-pastor-says-man-posing-as-washington-post-reporter-offered-reward-for-dirt-on-roy-moore/?utm_term=.d051ed8bf4f4&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;pastor in Alabama said he received a voice mail&lt;/a&gt; from a man falsely claiming to be a Post reporter and seeking women “willing to make damaging remarks” about Moore for money. No one associated with The Post made any such call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the days that followed the purported tipster’s initial emails, Reinhard communicated with the woman through an encrypted text messaging service and spoke by phone with the person to set up a meeting. When the woman suggested a meeting in New York, Reinhard told her she would have to know more about her story and her background. The woman offered that her real name was Jaime Phillips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillips said she lived in New York but would be in the Washington area during Thanksgiving week and suggested meeting Tuesday at a shopping mall in Tysons Corner, Va. “I’m planning to do some shopping there so I’ll find a good place to meet before you get there,” Phillips wrote in a message sent via Signal, the encrypted messaging service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Reinhard suggested bringing another reporter, Phillips wrote, “I’m not really comfortable with anyone else being there this time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reinhard arrived to find Phillips, wearing a brown leather jacket and with long red hair, already seated in a booth in the restaurant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 41-year-old said &lt;span&gt;she had been abused as a child, Reinhard said. Her family had moved often. She said&lt;/span&gt; she moved in with an aunt in the Talladega area of Alabama and started attending a church youth group when she met Moore in 1992, the year he became a county judge. She said she was 15. She said they started a “secret” sexual relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I knew it wasn’t right, but I didn’t care,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said that she got pregnant, that Moore talked her into an abortion and that he drove her to Mississippi to get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interview, she told Reinhard that she was so upset she couldn’t finish her salad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillips said she had started thinking about coming forward after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/violence-threats-begging-harvey-weinsteins-30-year-pattern-of-abuse-in-hollywood/2017/10/14/2638b1fc-aeab-11e7-be94-fabb0f1e9ffb_story.html?utm_term=.6e14c6effffb&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;allegations about Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein surfaced&lt;/a&gt;. Then she said she saw the news about Moore flashing across the television screen while in a break room at her job at a company called NFM Lending in Westchester County, N.Y., Reinhard said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillips also repeatedly asked the reporter to guarantee her that Moore would lose the election if she came forward. Reinhard told her in a subsequent text message that she could not predict what the impact would be. Reinhard said she also explained to Phillips that her claims would have to be fact-checked. Additionally, Reinhard asked her for documents that would corroborate or support her story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that day, Phillips told Reinhard that she felt “anxiety &amp;amp; negative energy after our meeting,” text messages show. “You just didn’t convince me that I should come forward,” she wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reinhard replied, “I’m so sorry but I want to be straight with you about the fact-checking process and the fact that we can’t guarantee what will happen as a result of another story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillips was not satisfied. On Wednesday, the day before Thanksgiving, she suggested meeting with another Post reporter, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/stephanie-mccrummen/?utm_term=.82f007923db8&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;Stephanie McCrummen&lt;/a&gt;, who co-wrote the initial article about Corfman. “I’d rather go to another paper than talk to you again,” Phillips told Reinhard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at the newsroom, Reinhard became concerned about elements of Phillips’s story. Phillips had said she lived in Alabama only for a summer while a teenager, but the cellphone number Phillips provided had an Alabama area code. Reinhard called NFM Lending in Westchester County, but they said a person named Jaime Phillips did not work there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice Crites, a Post researcher who was looking into Phillips’s background, found a document that strongly reinforced the reporters’ suspicions: a Web page for a fundraising campaign by someone with the same name. It was on the website GoFundMe.com under the name Jaime Phillips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-normal&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;unprocessed placeholder&quot; data-hi-res-src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/11/27/Investigative/Images/Croppedscreencapture-web-archive-org-web-20171122195050-https-www-gofundme-com-JaimeToNewYork-1511803913298.jpg?uuid=iR5ZotOkEee2Ldk0XO2JbQ&quot; data-low-res-src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_480w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/11/27/Investigative/Images/Croppedscreencapture-web-archive-org-web-20171122195050-https-www-gofundme-com-JaimeToNewYork-1511803913298.jpg?uuid=iR5ZotOkEee2Ldk0XO2JbQ&quot; data-raw-src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/11/27/Investigative/Images/Croppedscreencapture-web-archive-org-web-20171122195050-https-www-gofundme-com-JaimeToNewYork-1511803913298.jpg?uuid=iR5ZotOkEee2Ldk0XO2JbQ&quot; src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_60w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/11/27/Investigative/Images/Croppedscreencapture-web-archive-org-web-20171122195050-https-www-gofundme-com-JaimeToNewYork-1511803913298.jpg?uuid=iR5ZotOkEee2Ldk0XO2JbQ&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;The GoFundMe fundraising page. (Internet Archive)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m moving to New York!” the May 29 appeal said. “I’ve accepted a job to work in the conservative media movement to combat the lies and deceipt of the liberal MSM. I’ll be using my skills as a researcher and fact-checker to help our movement. I was laid off from my mortgage job a few months ago and came across the opportunity to change my career path.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a March posting on its Facebook page, Project Veritas said it was seeking 12 new “undercover reporters,” though the organization’s operatives use methods that are eschewed by mainstream journalists, such as misrepresenting themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A posting for the “journalist” job on the Project Veritas website that month warned that the job “is not a role for the faint of heart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job’s listed goal: “To adopt an alias persona, gain access to an identified person of interest and persuade that person to reveal information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also listed tasks that the job applicant should be able to master, including: “Learning a script,” “Preparing a background story to support your role,” “Gaining an appointment or access to the target of the investigation,” and “Operating concealed recording equipment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Veritas, founded in 2010, is a tax-exempt charity that says its mission is to “investigate and expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud and other misconduct.” It raised $4.8 million and employed 38 people in 2016, according to its public tax filing. It also had 92 volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O’Keefe’s criminal record has caused the charity problems in some states. Mississippi and Utah stripped the group of a license to raise money in those states because it failed to disclose O’Keefe’s conviction on state applications, records show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also working at Veritas is former television producer Robert J. Halderman, who was sentenced to six months in jail in 2010 after he was accused of trying to blackmail late-night host David Letterman. Halderman was with O’Keefe outside the Project Veritas offices Monday as a reporter tried to ask about Phillips’s role with the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Jaime Phillips is a relatively common name, it wasn’t a certainty that the GoFundMe page that Crites found was created by the same woman who approached The Post. But there was another telling detail, in addition to the name. One of two donations listed on the page was from a person whose name matched her daughter’s, according to public records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCrummen agreed to meet Phillips that afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillips suggested meeting somewhere in Alexandria, Va., saying she was shopping in the area. Post videographers accompanied McCrummen, who brought a printout of the fundraising page to the interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, Phillips had arrived early and was waiting for McCrummen, her purse resting on the table. When McCrummen put her purse near Phillips’s purse to block a possible camera, Phillips moved hers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Post videographers sat separately, unnoticed, at an adjacent table. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillips said she didn’t want to get into the details of what she had said happened between her and Moore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said she wanted McCrummen to assure her that the article would result in Moore’s defeat, according to a recording. McCrummen instead asked her about her story regarding Moore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillips complained that President Trump had endorsed Moore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So my whole thing is, like, I want him to be completely taken out of the race,” she said. “And I really expected that was going to happen, and now it’s not. So, I don’t know what you think about that.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCrummen asked Phillips to verify her identity with a photo identification. Phillips provided a Georgia driver’s license. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCrummen then asked her about the GoFundMe page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have a process of doing background, checking backgrounds and this kind of thing, so I wanted to ask you about one thing,” McCrummen said, pulling out a copy of the page and reading from it. “So I just wanted to ask you if you could explain this, and I also wanted to let you know, Jaime, that this is being recorded and video recorded.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Okay,” Phillips said. “Um, yeah, I was looking to take a job last summer in New York, but it fell through,” Phillips said. “Yeah, it was going to be with the Daily Caller, but it ended up falling through, so I wasn’t able to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked who at the Daily Caller interviewed her, Phillips said, “Kathy,” pausing before adding the last name, “Johnson.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;U1240902768811mmD&quot;&gt;Paul Conner, executive editor of the Daily Caller, said Monday that no one with the name Kathy Johnson works for the publication and that he has no record of having personally interviewed Phillips. Conner later said in an email that he had asked other top editors at the Daily Caller and the affiliated Daily Caller News Foundation about Phillips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“None of us has interviewed a woman by the name Jaime Phillips,” Conner wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Alexandria restaurant on Wednesday, Phillips also told The Post that she had not been in contact with the Moore campaign. As the interview ended, Phillips told McCrummen she was not recording the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think I probably just want to cancel and not go through with it at this point,” Phillips said at Souvlaki Bar shortly before ending the interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p channel=&quot;!Daily&quot;&gt;“I’m not going to answer any more questions,” she said. “I think I’m just going to go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She picked up her coat and bag, returned her drink to the front counter and left the restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 7 p.m. the message on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20171122195050/https:/www.gofundme.com/JaimeToNewYork&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;web.archive.org&quot;&gt;GoFundMe page&lt;/a&gt; was gone, replaced by a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Campaign is complete and no longer active,” it read.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook users in Romania see content related to street protests reviewed</title>
<link>http://www.business-review.eu/news/certain-facebook-users-in-romania-see-content-related-to-street-protests-reviewed-under-community-standards-153255</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.business-review.eu/news/certain-facebook-users-in-romania-see-content-related-to-street-protests-reviewed-under-community-standards-153255</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A series of Romanian bloggers, vloggers, journalists and other influencers alongside regular Facebook users said they had issues posting or sharing on Facebook content related to the street protests that took place on Sunday evening across the major cities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dragos Stanca, managing partner digital consultancy ThinkDigital, gathered on his Facebook page print screens from users who showed the messages they got from the social media behemoth. Among those hit by restrictions there were Facebook users posting live feeds from the protests and even those sharing media pieces about the marches. Some users weren’t able to share events created on Facebook for the street protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common notification from Facebook was that the post was under review to see if it breached the community standards. Other posts about the protests were suspected by Facebook of being spam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of Romanians &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.business-review.eu/featured/anti-judiciary-laws-protests-in-romania-tens-of-thousands-call-for-resignation-of-government-153178&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;marched in the main cities&lt;/a&gt;, asking the ruling coalition PSD-ALDE to drop controversial amendments to the judiciary.

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A series of Romanian bloggers, vloggers, journalists and other influencers alongside regular Facebook users said they had issues posting or sharing on Facebook content related to the street protests that took place on Sunday evening across the major cities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dragos Stanca, managing partner digital consultancy ThinkDigital, gathered on his Facebook page print screens from users who showed the messages they got from the social media behemoth. Among those hit by restrictions there were Facebook users posting live feeds from the protests and even those sharing media pieces about the marches. Some users weren’t able to share events created on Facebook for the street protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common notification from Facebook was that the post was under review to see if it breached the community standards. Other posts about the protests were suspected by Facebook of being spam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of Romanians &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.business-review.eu/featured/anti-judiciary-laws-protests-in-romania-tens-of-thousands-call-for-resignation-of-government-153178&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;marched in the main cities&lt;/a&gt;, asking the ruling coalition PSD-ALDE to drop controversial amendments to the judiciary. Around 20,000 took to the streets of Bucharest, also calling for the resignation of the center left government led by Mihai Tudose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some of the posts under review by Facebook.&lt;/h2&gt;

<title>American Equity</title>
<link>http://blog.samaltman.com/american-equity</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.samaltman.com/american-equity</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I’d like feedback on the following idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that every adult US citizen should get an annual share of the US GDP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that owning something like a share in America would align all of us in making the country as successful as possible—the better the country does, the better everyone does—and give more people a fair shot at achieving the life they want.  And we all work together to create the system that generates so much prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that a new social contract like what I’m suggesting here—where we agree to a floor and no ceiling—would lead to a huge increase in US prosperity and keep us in the global lead.  Countries that concentrate wealth in a small number of families do worse over the long term—if we don’t take a radical step toward a fair, inclusive system, we will not be the leading country in the world for much longer.  This would harm all Americans more than most realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are historical examples of countries giving out land to citizens (such as the Homestead Acts in the US) as a way to distribute the resources people needed to succeed.  Today, the fundamental input to wealth generation isn’t farmland, but money and ideas—you really do need money to make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Equity would also cushion the transition from the jobs of today to the jobs of tomorrow.  Automation holds the promise of creating more abundance than we ever dreamed possible, but it’s going to significantly change how we think about work.  If everyone benefits more directly from economic growth, then it will be easier to move faster toward this better world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default case for automation is to concentrate wealth (and therefore power) in a tiny number of hands.  America has repeatedly found ways to challenge this sort of concentration, and we need to do so again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint-stock company was one of the most important inventions in human history.  It allowed us to align a lot of people in pursuit of a common goal and accomplish things no individual could.  Obviously, the US is not a company, but I think a similar model can work for the US as well as it does for companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A proposal like this obviously requires a lot of new funding [1] to do at large scale, but I think we could start very small—a few hundred dollars per citizen per year—and ramp it up to a long-term target of 10-20% of GDP per year when the GDP per capita doubles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no delusions about the challenges of such a program.  There would be difficult consequences for things like immigration policy that will need a lot of discussion.  We’d also need to figure out rules about transferability and borrowing against this equity.  And we’d need to set it up in a way that does not exacerbate short-term thinking or favor unsustainable growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as the economy grows, we could imagine a world in which every American would have their basic needs guaranteed.  Absolute poverty would be eliminated, and we would no longer motivate people through the fear of not being able to eat.  In addition to being the obviously right thing to do, eliminating poverty will increase productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Equity would create a society that I believe would work much better than what we have today.  It would free Americans to work on what they really care about, improve social cohesion, and incentivize everyone to think about ways to grow the whole pie.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;[1] It’s time to update our tax system for the way wealth works in the modern world—for example, taxing capital and labor at the same rates.  And we should consider eventually replacing some of our current aid programs, which distort incentives and are needlessly complicated and inefficient, with something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this won’t solve all our problems—we still need serious reform in areas such as housing, education, and healthcare.  Without policies that address the cost of living crisis, any sort of redistribution will be far less effective than it otherwise could be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;p-2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruben Meerman&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Andrew Brown&lt;/strong&gt; explain why the answer might not be what you expect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-3&quot;&gt;Considering the soaring overweight and obesity rates and strong interest in this topic, there is surprising ignorance and confusion about the metabolic process of weight loss among the general public and health professionals alike. We encountered widespread misconceptions about how humans lose weight among general practitioners, dietitians, and personal trainers (fig 1&lt;a id=&quot;xref-fig-1-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-down-link&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7257#F1&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;⇓&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Most people believed that fat is converted to energy or heat, which violates the law of conservation of mass. We suspect this misconception is caused by the “energy in/energy out” mantra and the focus on energy production in university biochemistry courses. Other misconceptions were that the metabolites of fat are excreted in the faeces or converted to muscle. We present a novel calculation to show how we “lose weight.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Weight we want to “lose”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-5&quot;&gt;Excess carbohydrate or protein in the diet is converted to triglyceride and stored in the lipid droplets of adipocytes. Excess dietary fat needs no conversion other than lipolysis and re-esterification. People who wish to lose weight while maintaining their fat-free mass are, biochemically speaking, attempting to metabolise the triglycerides stored in their adipocytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-6&quot;&gt;The chemical formula for an average triglyceride molecule can be deduced from fatty acid composition studies. In 1960, Hirsch and colleagues published data that yield an “average fatty acid” with the formula C&lt;sub&gt;17.4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;33.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-1-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7257#ref-1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; This 50 year old result is in remarkable agreement with more recent data.&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-2-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7257#ref-2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; Three “average fatty acids” esterified to the glycerol backbone (+3C, +6H) give an “average triglyceride” with the formula C&lt;sub&gt;54.8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;104.4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. The three most common fatty acids stored in human adipose tissues are oleate (C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;34&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), palmitate (C&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and linoleate (C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;),&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-1-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7257#ref-1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-2-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7257#ref-2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; which all esterify to form C&lt;sub&gt;55&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;104&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-7&quot;&gt;The complete oxidation of a single triglyceride molecule involves many enzymes and biochemical steps, but the entire process can be summarised as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-8&quot;&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;55&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;104&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;+78O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;→55CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+52H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O+energy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-9&quot;&gt;Stoichiometry shows that complete oxidation of 10 kg of human fat requires 29 kg of inhaled oxygen producing 28 kg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 11 kg of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. This tells us the metabolic fate of fat but remains silent about the proportions of the mass stored in those 10 kg of fat that depart as carbon dioxide or water during weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-10&quot;&gt;To calculate these values, we traced every atom’s pathway out of the body. The carbon and hydrogen atoms obviously depart as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, respectively. The fate of a triglyceride molecule’s six oxygen atoms is a conundrum solved in 1949 by Lifson and colleagues&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-3-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7257#ref-3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; They used labelled heavy oxygen (O&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;) to show that the oxygen atoms of body water and respiratory carbon dioxide are rapidly exchanged through the formation of carbonic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). A triglyceride’s six oxygen atoms will therefore be shared by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in the same 2:1 ratio in which oxygen exists in each substance. In other words, four will be exhaled and two will form water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;sec-2&quot; readability=&quot;20.895752895753&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Novel calculation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-11&quot;&gt;The proportion of a triglyceride molecule’s mass exhaled in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the proportion of its molecular weight (daltons) contributed by its 55 carbon atoms plus four of its oxygen atoms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-12&quot;&gt;(661 Da (C&lt;sub&gt;55&lt;/sub&gt;)+64 Da (O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;))/(861 Da (C&lt;sub&gt;55&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;104&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;))×100=84%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-13&quot;&gt;The proportion of mass that becomes water is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-14&quot;&gt;(105 Da (H&lt;sub&gt;104&lt;/sub&gt;)+32 Da (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;))/(861 Da (C&lt;sub&gt;55&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;104&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;))×100=16%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-15&quot;&gt;These results show that the lungs are the primary excretory organ for weight loss (fig 2&lt;a id=&quot;xref-fig-2-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-down-link&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7257#F2&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;⇓&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The water formed may be excreted in the urine, faeces, sweat, breath, tears, or other bodily fluids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lifting the veil on weight loss&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-17&quot;&gt;At rest, an average 70 kg person consuming a mixed diet (respiratory quotient 0.8) exhales about 200 ml of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in 12 breaths per minute.&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-4-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7257#ref-4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; Each of those breaths therefore excretes 33 mg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2,&lt;/sub&gt; of which 8.9 mg is carbon. In a day spent asleep, at rest, and performing light activities that double the resting metabolic rate, each for 8 hours, this person exhales 0.74 kg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; so that 203 g of carbon are lost from the body. For comparison, 500 g of sucrose (C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;) provides 8400 kJ (2000 kcal) and contains 210 g of carbon. Replacing one hour of rest with exercise that raises the metabolic rate to seven times that of resting by, for example, jogging, removes an additional 39 g of carbon from the body, raising the total by about 20% to 240 g. For comparison, a single 100 g muffin represents about 20% of an average person’s total daily energy requirement. Physical activity as a weight loss strategy is, therefore, easily foiled by relatively small quantities of excess food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-18&quot;&gt;Our calculations show that the lungs are the primary excretory organ for fat. Losing weight requires unlocking the carbon stored in fat cells, thus reinforcing that often heard refrain of “eat less, move more.” We recommend these concepts be included in secondary school science curriculums and university biochemistry courses to correct widespread misconceptions about weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Asking members to support journalism, The Guardian raises more revenue than ads</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Instead of using tote bags, tickets to live events, or other swag, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;‘s &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.theguardian.com/us/contribute?acquisitionData&quot;&gt;membership program&lt;/a&gt; has grown to 800,000 supporters a year and a half after doubling down on its membership initiative. The key? A shift from a commercially focused plea to an emotional, service-based request, the two women leading the effort said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our appeal is very much an appeal from The Guardian,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/amichel&quot;&gt;Amanda Michel&lt;/a&gt;, deputy executive editor of membership and senior product manager for acquisitions and data technology, said. “It doesn’t speak to the section they’re in. It doesn’t speak to what they read. It speaks to the heart of the Guardian’s moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-relatedstory&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;embed-relatedstory-imagelink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/04/newsonomics-the-guardian-is-trying-to-swing-googles-pendulum-back-to-publishers/?relatedstory&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;315&quot; height=&quot;177&quot; src=&quot;http://www.niemanlab.org/images/google-sign-cc-315x177.jpg&quot; class=&quot;embed-relatedstory-image wp-post-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.niemanlab.org/images/google-sign-cc-315x177.jpg 315w, http://www.niemanlab.org/images/google-sign-cc-220x124.jpg 220w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;
Financial difficulties struck The Guardian, the London-based, trust-owned international news organization, in recent years, with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/04/newsonomics-the-guardian-is-trying-to-swing-googles-pendulum-back-to-publishers/&quot;&gt;print-to-digital advertising downturn&lt;/a&gt; that wracked news industries around the world. It had also taken on an ambitious plan to expand internationally following its coverage of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-nsa-files&quot;&gt;Edward Snowden’s NSA files&lt;/a&gt; and subsequent Pulitzer in 2014. That ambition didn’t quite follow through — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/stevenperlberg/how-the-guardian-lost-america&quot;&gt;Buzzfeed reported in June&lt;/a&gt; that “the thirst for global expansion was so strong, in fact, that the Guardian’s former US CEO says he was pressured to make unattainable business projections to fuel the growth.” Those figures included $15.5 million in revenue from April 2015-16 amid more than $15 million in operating losses with a revenue target of $32.2 million for 2016-2017. Faced with the heat of digital advertising and ad-blocking software, the Guardian focused on shaking things up.

The organization offers subscriptions and, as of this past summer, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/08/could-the-guardians-quest-for-philanthropic-support-squeeze-out-other-news-nonprofits/&quot;&gt;a philanthropic arm&lt;/a&gt; as well, but turned to membership in 2014 to draw readers further in and bolster its grassroots support rather than instituting a paywall. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/2015/jan/29/andrew-miller-steps-down-as-chief-executive-of-guardian-media-group&quot;&gt;Former Guardian Media Group CEO Andrew Miller&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/02/ceo-andrew-miller-membership-type-propositions-will-be-key-to-the-guardians-revenue-growth/&quot;&gt;explained the mindset&lt;/a&gt; at the time:
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Will it be a wall between the reader and the content? No, it won’t be. It’ll be adding more value for people who want to get more involved in the Guardian, who feel passionate about the Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recognize we have to get more direct-to-consumer revenue over time, and the way we will do that is through membership-type propositions, but it’s going to be much more than a paywall. A paywall is to me an inverse loyalty scheme, where the more you consume the more you pay, which doesn’t seem to work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2016, The Guardian re-emphasized the potential of the membership program while embarking on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/01/as-the-guardian-cuts-50m-it-plans-to-build-on-its-membership-program/&quot;&gt;cutting spree of 20 percent&lt;/a&gt;, about 50 million pounds, from its budget over three years. The “enhanced membership offer” aims to double reader revenues, according to a Guardian press release detailing the cost-cutting breakdown. Around this time, “a small cross-functional team made up of editorial, commercial, UX and engineers began to reimagine what the membership scheme could be when rooted in the Guardian’s journalism,” Michel said. She and membership executive editor &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NatalieHanman&quot;&gt;Natalie Hanman&lt;/a&gt; transitioned within their Guardian roles to focus on membership. (Michel had joined the Guardian in 2011 as open editor, bringing her experience from ProPublica and Huffington Post with skills in community engagement, and Hanman was editor at the Guardian’s opinion site.) Twelve thousand members had already signed up, but the membership system largely centered on in-person events — not exactly encouraging anyone outside of London to become a member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was in April last year that Amanda and I did the first experiment basically using a carrot, not a stick, to support the Guardian’s journalism,” Hanman said, explaining that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers&quot;&gt;Panama Papers investigation&lt;/a&gt; was the first test of some of those ideas. “We were really drawing the link between time and effort and skill we put into that investigation, working with these organizations around the world and asking people if you value this, please contribute toward this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of 2016, reader revenues — that’s memberships, subscriptions, newsstand sales, and one-time contributions — comprised more of the Guardian’s revenue than advertising dollars did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, editor-in-chief &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KathViner&quot;&gt;Katharine Viner&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2017/oct/26/together-we-are-safeguarding-the-guardians-independent-journalism?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that financial support from readers had officially surpassed advertising revenue, noting that 500,000 individuals contributed monthly to the Guardian as members and print/digital subscribers and another 300,000 one-time donations have added to the organization’s coffers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are encouraged and cheered by the hundreds of thousands of you who are supporting our journalism. In the last year alone, the number of readers who support us regularly has more than doubled, and we now receive more income from our readers than we do from advertisers. This is a significant step,” Viner wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digiday.com/media/guardian-wsj-two-approaches-membership/&quot;&gt;In its infancy&lt;/a&gt;, the membership program had invited readers to become “friends” for free while paying for events, “partners” for £15 (US $19.79) per month with discounts to ticketed events, and “patrons” for £60, with the aforementioned discounts and access to Guardian newsroom events. Now, however, readers can join as “supporters” for £5 per month with ticket access, “partners” for £15 per month that includes tickets to Guardian Live events or Guardian-published books and a welcome gift, or “patrons” or £60 per month with the other benefits plus access to “exclusive, behind-the-scenes” events. But Michel and Hamnan credit the events for catalyzing change and restoring energy to the membership drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because readers outside of London didn’t have much incentive to attend Guardian events at the newsroom in the city and the Guardian was making this international thrust, it didn’t make sense to push that as central to the journalism organization’s pitch when readers and reporters, editors, and designers could interact in more multidimensional ways. The pair revamped both the ask and the offerings — moving from 12,000 members in the beginning of 2016 to, today, 300,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A surprising number of readers also didn’t understand the financial struggles plaguing print journalistic organizations of all sizes, Hanman and Michel said. By placing an appeal on the Panama Papers articles in April 2016, “we were really drawing that link between time and effort and skill we put into that investigation, working with these organizations around the world, and asking people if you value this please contribute toward this,” Natalie said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The request at the foot of Guardian articles today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;nakedboxedimage&quot; src=&quot;http://www.niemanlab.org/images/guardian-membership-ask.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;491&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our marketing colleagues…are used to using one line [pitches] to advertise membership,” with a focus on pithiness and wit, Hanman said. “The longer appeal resonates with people more. We need to explain to people why we are pursuing this approach. Even as journalists used to writing snappy headlines, we need to take a bit more time here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from intricate investigations like the Panama and the more recent Paradise Papers revelations, the Guardian’s membership spiked following coverage on the environment, Brexit, and the U.K. election. Some members even double-dipped and made more donations as new reporting emerged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Quite a few readers had already supported the Guardian, and they wanted to give again,” Michel said. “A pretty significant percentage of them were educators. This was a way for them to ensure that the public could be well informed on a topic that they felt should be in the public domain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members’ responses to topics validate time and attention spent by the editorial staff to the stories on that beat. The reader feedback creates a looped “work-and-learn approach” while also validating Guardian coverage, Michel said. But this work requires feeding the beast in a different way: “We want to keep growing our base but making sure the 800,000 supporters we have feel valued,” Hanman said. “If they want to have a close relationship with us, we develop it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engagement with Guardian members includes a weekly newsletter to supporters, a weekly “behind the scenes” story production series, a Q&amp;amp;A with a columnist, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/membership/series/we-need-to-talk-about&quot;&gt;even a podcast based on supporters’ calls and questions&lt;/a&gt;. Hanman and Michel said the next goal is not based on reaching another metric milestone, but on delving further into reader relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The last year has really been a foundational year,” Michel said. “It’s about creating a network of colleagues across the Guardian to develop essentially a shared experience and expertise. Now that we have the foundation we can start becoming more creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve moved away from the traditional transactional model to a more emotional one that’s rooted in our journalism,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Laptops Are Great, But Not During a Lecture or a Meeting</title>

<description>&lt;div id=&quot;top-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;ResponsiveAd-topAd--3uZAv&quot; data-reactid=&quot;41&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;top-slug&quot; class=&quot;ResponsiveAd-hide--3eu5-&quot; data-reactid=&quot;42&quot;&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;43&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot; data-reactid=&quot;101&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;102&quot;&gt;Step into any college lecture hall and you are likely to find a sea of students typing away at open, glowing laptops as the professor speaks. But you won’t see that when I’m teaching.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot; data-reactid=&quot;105&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;106&quot;&gt;Though I make a few exceptions, I generally ban electronics, including laptops, in my classes and research seminars.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot; data-reactid=&quot;109&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;110&quot;&gt;That may seem extreme. After all, with laptops, students can, in some ways, absorb more from lectures than they can with just paper and pen. They can download course readings, look up unfamiliar concepts on the fly and create an accurate, well-organized record of the lecture material. All of that is good.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot; data-reactid=&quot;113&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;114&quot;&gt;But a growing body of evidence shows that over all, college students learn less when they use computers or tablets during lectures. They also tend to earn worse grades. The research is unequivocal: Laptops distract from learning, both for users and for those around them. It’s not much of a leap to expect that electronics also undermine learning in high school classrooms or that they hurt productivity in meetings in all kinds of workplaces.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot; data-reactid=&quot;117&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;118&quot;&gt;Measuring the effect of laptops on learning is tough. One problem is that students don’t all use laptops the same way. It might be that dedicated students, who tend to earn high grades, use them more frequently in classes. It might be that the most distracted students turn to their laptops whenever they are bored. In any case, a simple comparison of performance may confuse the effect of laptops with the characteristics of the students who choose to use them. Researchers call this “selection bias.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot; data-reactid=&quot;121&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;122&quot;&gt;Researchers can solve that problem by randomly assigning some students to use laptops. With that approach, the students who use laptops are comparable in all other ways to those who don’t.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot; data-reactid=&quot;125&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;126&quot;&gt;In a series of experiments at Princeton University and the University of California, Los Angeles, students were randomly assigned either laptops or pen and paper for note-taking at a lecture. Those who had used laptops had substantially &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://sites.udel.edu/victorp/files/2010/11/Psychological-Science-2014-Mueller-0956797614524581-1u0h0yu.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot; data-reactid=&quot;128&quot;&gt;worse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;130&quot;&gt; understanding of the lecture, as measured by a standardized test, than those who did not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot; data-reactid=&quot;133&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;134&quot;&gt;The researchers hypothesized that, because students can type faster than they can write, the lecturer’s words flowed right to the students’ typing fingers without stopping in their brains for substantive processing. Students writing by hand had to process and condense the spoken material simply to enable their pens to keep up with the lecture. Indeed, the notes of the laptop users more closely resembled transcripts than lecture summaries. The handwritten versions were more succinct but included the salient issues discussed in the lecture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot; data-reactid=&quot;137&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;138&quot;&gt;Even so, it may seem heavy-handed to ban electronics in the classroom. Most college students are legal adults who can serve in the armed forces, vote and own property. Why shouldn’t they decide themselves whether to use a laptop?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot; data-reactid=&quot;141&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;142&quot;&gt;The strongest argument against allowing that choice is that one student’s use of a laptop harms the learning of students around them. In a series of lab experiments, researchers at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.yorku.ca/index.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot; data-reactid=&quot;144&quot;&gt;York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;146&quot;&gt; University and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mcmaster.ca/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot; data-reactid=&quot;148&quot;&gt;McMaster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;150&quot;&gt; University in Canada tested the effect of laptops on students who weren’t using them. Some students were told to perform small tasks on their laptops unrelated to the lecture, like looking up movie times. As expected, these students retained less of the lecture material. But what is really interesting is that the learning of students seated near the laptop users was also &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131512002254?via%3Dihub&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot; data-reactid=&quot;152&quot;&gt;negatively affected&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;154&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot; data-reactid=&quot;157&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;158&quot;&gt;The economic term for such a spillover is a “negative externality,” which occurs when one person’s consumption harms the well-being of others. The classic negative externality is pollution: A factory burning coal or a car using gasoline can harm the air and environment for those around it. A laptop can sometimes be a form of visual pollution: Those nearby see its screen, and their attention is pulled toward its enticements, which often include not just note-taking but Facebook, Twitter, email and news.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot; data-reactid=&quot;161&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;162&quot;&gt;These experiments go only so far. They may not capture positive effects of laptops in real classrooms over the course of a semester, when students use their typed notes for review and grades are at stake. But another study did just that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot; data-reactid=&quot;165&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;166&quot;&gt;At the United States Military Academy, a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775716303454&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot; data-reactid=&quot;168&quot;&gt;team of professors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;170&quot;&gt; studied laptop use in an introductory economics class. The course was taught in small sections, which the researchers randomly assigned to one of three conditions: electronics allowed, electronics banned and tablets allowed but only if laid flat on desks, where professors could monitor their use. By the end of the semester, students in the classrooms with laptops or tablets had performed substantially worse than those in the sections where electronics were banned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot; data-reactid=&quot;173&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;174&quot;&gt;You might question whether the experience of military cadets learning economics is relevant to students in other settings — say, community college students learning Shakespeare. But we’d expect the negative effects of laptops to be, if anything, less at West Point, where all courses are taught in small sections, than it is at institutions with many large lectures. Further, cadets have very strong incentives to perform well and avoid distractions, since class rank has a major impact on their job status after graduation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot; data-reactid=&quot;177&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;178&quot;&gt;The best way to settle this question is probably to study laptop use in more colleges. But until then, I find the evidence sufficiently compelling that I’ve made my decision: I ban electronics in my own classes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot; data-reactid=&quot;181&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;182&quot;&gt;I do make one major exception. Students with learning disabilities may use electronics in order to participate in class. This does reveal that any student using electronics has a learning disability. That is a loss of privacy for those students, which also occurs when they are given more time to complete a test. Those negatives must be weighed against the learning losses of other students when laptops are used in class.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot; data-reactid=&quot;185&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;186&quot;&gt;Students may object that a laptop ban prevents them from storing notes on their computers. But smartphones can snap pictures of handwritten pages and convert them to an electronic format. Even better, outside class, students can read their own handwritten notes and type them, if they like, a process that enhances learning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneNews--sRTft&quot; data-reactid=&quot;189&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;190&quot;&gt;The best evidence available now suggests that students should avoid laptops during lectures and just pick up their pens. It’s not a leap to think that the same holds for middle and high school classrooms, as well as for workplace meetings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Big Vitamin D Mistake</title>
<link>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/28768407/</link>

<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;no_b_m copper&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;no_t_m&quot;&gt;Since 2006, type 1 diabetes in Finland has plateaued and then decreased after the authorities' decision to fortify dietary milk products with cholecalciferol. The role of vitamin D in innate and adaptive immunity is critical. A statistical error in the estimation of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D was recently discovered; in a correct analysis of the data used by the Institute of Medicine, it was found that 8895 IU/d was needed for 97.5% of individuals to achieve values ≥50 nmol/L. Another study confirmed that 6201 IU/d was needed to achieve 75 nmol/L and 9122 IU/d was needed to reach 100 nmol/L. The largest meta-analysis ever conducted of studies published between 1966 and 2013 showed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels &amp;lt;75 nmol/L may be too low for safety and associated with higher all-cause mortality, demolishing the previously presumed U-shape curve of mortality associated with vitamin D levels. Since all-disease mortality is reduced to 1.0 with serum vitamin D levels ≥100 nmol/L, we call public health authorities to consider designating as the RDA at least three-fourths of the levels proposed by the Endocrine Society Expert Committee as safe upper tolerable daily intake doses. This could lead to a recommendation of 1000 IU for children &amp;lt;1 year on enriched formula and 1500 IU for breastfed children older than 6 months, 3000 IU for children &amp;gt;1 year of age, and around 8000 IU for young adults and thereafter. Actions are urgently needed to protect the global population from vitamin D deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Coinbase: The Heart of the Bitcoin Frenzy</title>

&lt;div id=&quot;top-slug&quot; class=&quot;ResponsiveAd-hide--3eu5-&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;SAN FRANCISCO — The booming stock market of the 1920s had the New York Stock Exchange. The tech bubble of the 1990s had Nasdaq and E-Trade. And the virtual currency market of the last year has had Coinbase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-captionText--2WFdF Media-captionText--2e27a&quot;&gt;Coinbase employees lining up for free food in the gaming room of the company's office in San Francisco.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jason Henry for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Coinbase has been at the center of the speculative frenzy driving up the value of Bitcoin — which &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/technology/bitcoin-payments-gold.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot;&gt;topped $13,000 on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; — and similar currencies. While there are many Bitcoin exchanges around the world, Coinbase has been the dominant place that ordinary Americans go to buy and sell virtual currency. No company had made it simpler to sign up, link a bank account or debit card, and begin buying Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;The number of people with Coinbase accounts has gone from 5.5 million in January to 13.3 million at the end of November, according to data from the Altana Digital Currency Fund. In late November, Coinbase was sometimes getting 100,000 new customers a day — leaving the company with more customers than Charles Schwab and E-Trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;The company faces challenges that are a reminder of the early days of now-mainstream online brokerages, which suffered through untimely outages and harsh criticism from traditional finance companies and government regulators. And Coinbase’s missteps make it clear that the virtual currency industry is still young, with little of the battle testing that other financial markets have faced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-captionText--2WFdF Media-captionText--2e27a&quot;&gt;An employee working in a nook inside Coinbase’s offices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jason Henry for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Coinbase’s offices in downtown San Francisco show a start-up straining to keep up with growth. The company offers all the usual perks: free lunch and dinner, a sizable cafeteria and a room with yoga mats and board games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Recently, every last inch of space has been pressed into action. The day after Bitcoin hit $10,000 last week, a training session for Coinbase managers was moved to the game room because the engineering team needed to set up an emergency war room in the regular conference room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;The engineering team was trying to get Coinbase back up after the company’s site was knocked offline, overwhelmed by a wave of incoming traffic. The number of visitors was double what it had been during the previous peak — two days earlier — and eight times what it had been in June, the peak until recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;All of the big Bitcoin exchanges went down for at least part of the day, and Coinbase got back online faster than most. Still, any sort of downtime like that would be unacceptable in more traditional exchanges where stocks and commodities are traded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;“There are some well-known places this year when we weren’t able to keep up with the volume,” said Jeremy Henrickson, the chief product officer at Coinbase. “We are not where we need to be yet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-captionText--2WFdF Media-captionText--2e27a&quot;&gt;Coinbase employees tossed around a &quot;talk box&quot; during a question-and-answer session with company executives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jason Henry for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Most Friday afternoons, Brian Armstrong, the chief executive of Coinbase, holds a session in the cafeteria where employees can ask him anything. On the Friday of the record-hitting week, Mr. Armstrong discussed how the company was planning to grow and introduced Asiff Hirji, the new president and chief operating officer who will help him oversee it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;The addition of Mr. Hirji, who had the same role at TD Ameritrade, was an implicit recognition that this new industry needs more seasoned hands to help young executives like Mr. Armstrong, who is 34. Mr. Hirji will manage Coinbase’s trading operations while Mr. Armstrong focuses on new projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-captionText--2WFdF Media-captionText--2e27a&quot;&gt;Brian Armstrong, the chief executive of Coinbase, speaking with employees.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jason Henry for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Mr. Armstrong has been running Coinbase since he co-founded it in 2012. Soft-spoken and reserved, he is an unusual figure in an industry filled with loud ideologues. He has done few public appearances during Bitcoin’s recent bull market, and he recognizes the current frenzy has come with downsides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;“It’s probably a little bit too focused on the price or people trying to make money,” Mr. Armstrong said last week. “The thing I’m passionate about with digital currency is the world having an open financial system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;There is some irony to the success that Mr. Armstrong has experienced as a result of Bitcoin’s rising price. In 2015, he helped &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/business/dealbook/bitcoin-china.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot;&gt;lead a push&lt;/a&gt; to get the Bitcoin network to expand so it could handle more transactions. That effort failed, and Mr. Armstrong &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2017/11/bitcoin-broke-coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrongs-heart-hes-now-focused-ethereum/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot;&gt;said in a recent interview&lt;/a&gt; that Bitcoin “did break my heart a little bit.” He said he now holds more of his wealth in a Bitcoin competitor, Ether, which Coinbase also offers to customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-captionText--2WFdF Media-captionText--2e27a&quot;&gt;A monitor in the Coinbase office displaying the value of several virtual currencies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jason Henry for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Most of the screens in the Coinbase offices show the performance of the company’s servers and customer metrics — like the number of customers downloading its iPhone app. For a time last week, Coinbase was among the 10 most downloaded iPhone apps, ahead of Uber and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;There are a few screens, including one in the cafeteria, that show the price of Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ether, the three virtual currencies that Coinbase buys, sells and holds for customers. Litecoin was created by a former Coinbase employee and is often described as silver to Bitcoin’s gold. The newer Ether, which lives on the Ethereum network, is the second most valuable virtual currency after Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-captionText--2WFdF Media-captionText--2e27a&quot;&gt;Licenses issued to Coinbase.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jason Henry for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Coinbase set itself apart from other early Bitcoin companies when it was one of the first to get a new, special license for virtual currency companies in New York, called the BitLicense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;In the last year, though, Coinbase’s most notable interaction with the government came after the Internal Revenue Service asked the company to &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/19/business/dealbook/irs-is-seeking-tax-evaders-who-use-bitcoin.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot;&gt;hand over all of its customer records&lt;/a&gt;. Bitcoin holders are supposed to pay taxes if they collect gains from selling coins, but the I.R.S. has said that only a few hundred people have done so each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Coinbase fought the broad request from the I.R.S. and last week, while the price was skyrocketing, announced an agreement to hand over only the records of customers who made transactions involving more than $20,000 of virtual currencies — around 3 percent of the company’s customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-captionText--2WFdF Media-captionText--2e27a&quot;&gt;Adam White, the general manager of a Coinbase exchange for large investors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jason Henry for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;In addition to the brokerage service for small investors, Coinbase also runs an exchange, called GDAX, tailored to larger investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;GDAX is overseen by Adam White, a former Air Force officer and a graduate of Harvard Business School. The day Bitcoin hit $10,000, he was in New York speaking with big financial institutions that are looking into Bitcoin. Some companies are getting ready to begin trading Bitcoin futures contracts in December, when that activity becomes available on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;A year ago, his Wall Street outreach was difficult, but “it’s all inbound now,” Mr. White said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-captionText--2WFdF Media-captionText--2e27a&quot;&gt;Workers preparing new office space for Coinbase, part of the company's significant expansion plans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jason Henry for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Not surprisingly, Coinbase is on a building spree. It recently leased office space in New York that will handle the Wall Street business and a new service that holds virtual currencies for large customers. In San Francisco, the company is adding two new floors in the building where it now has one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-captionText--2WFdF Media-captionText--2e27a&quot;&gt;New Coinbase employees learning the ins and outs of virtual currencies during a lunchtime meeting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jason Henry for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Still, the main concern among virtual currency investors is that Coinbase has not expanded fast enough. In May, the company &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/@CodyBrown/how-to-lose-8k-worth-of-bitcoin-in-15-minutes-with-verizon-and-coinbase-com-ba75fb8d0bac&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot;&gt;was criticized by a customer&lt;/a&gt; who could not reach anyone at the company after his account was hacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Coinbase is trying to be more responsive. At the beginning of the year, the company had 24 employees providing customer support. It now has around 180, with most of them outsourced from a call center in Texas and an email response team in the Philippines. The cafeteria is often turned into a “Crypto Club” where new employees are taught the ins and outs of virtual currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Daniel Romero, the general manager of Coinbase, said he wanted to have 400 customer support employees by the first quarter of next year to provide phone support around the clock. But in the meantime, there is a 10-day backlog of service requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;“When your customer support issues are that publicly bad, and you have your site go down when people want to be trading,” it’s a very humbling experience, Mr. Romero said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Uber paid 20-year-old Florida man to keep data breach secret</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-cyber-payment-exclusive/exclusive-uber-paid-20-year-old-florida-man-to-keep-data-breach-secret-sources-idUSKBN1E101C</guid>
<description>&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;38&quot;&gt;SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A 20-year-old Florida man was responsible for the large data breach at Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] last year and was paid by Uber to destroy the data through a so-called “bug bounty” program normally used to identify small code vulnerabilities, three people familiar with the events have told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;42&quot;&gt;Uber announced on Nov. 21 that the personal data of 57 million users, including 600,000 drivers in the United States, were stolen in a breach that occurred in October 2016, and that it paid the hacker $100,000 to destroy the information. But the company did not reveal any information about the hacker or how it paid him the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;43&quot;&gt;Uber made the payment last year through a program designed to reward security researchers who report flaws in a company’s software, these people said. Uber’s bug bounty service - as such a program is known in the industry - is hosted by a company called HackerOne, which offers its platform to a number of tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;44&quot;&gt;Reuters was unable to establish the identity of the hacker or another person who sources said helped him. Uber spokesman Matt Kallman declined to comment on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;45&quot;&gt;Newly appointed Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi fired two of Uber’s top security officials when he announced the breach last month, saying the incident should have been disclosed to regulators at the time it was discovered, about a year before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;46&quot;&gt;It remains unclear who made the final decision to authorize the payment to the hacker and to keep the breach secret, though the sources said then-CEO Travis Kalanick was aware of the breach and bug bounty payment in November of last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;47&quot;&gt;Kalanick, who stepped down as Uber CEO in June, declined to comment on the matter, according to his spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;48&quot;&gt;A payment of $100,000 through a bug bounty program would be extremely unusual, with one former HackerOne executive saying it would represent an “all-time record.” Security professionals said rewarding a hacker who had stolen data also would be well outside the normal rules of a bounty program, where payments are typically in the $5,000 to $10,000 range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;49&quot;&gt;HackerOne hosts Uber’s bug bounty program but does not manage it, and plays no role in deciding whether payouts are appropriate or how large they should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;50&quot;&gt;HackerOne CEO Marten Mickos said he could not discuss an individual customer’s programs. “In all cases when a bug bounty award is processed through HackerOne, we receive identifying information of the recipient in the form of an IRS W-9 or W-8BEN form before payment of the award can be made,” he said, referring to U.S. Internal Revenue Service forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;51&quot;&gt;According to two of the sources, Uber made the payment to confirm the hacker’s identity and have him sign a nondisclosure agreement to deter further wrongdoing. Uber also conducted a forensic analysis of the hacker’s machine to make sure the data had been purged, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;52&quot;&gt;One source described the hacker as “living with his mom in a small home trying to help pay the bills,” adding that members of Uber’s security team did not want to pursue prosecution of an individual who did not appear to pose a further threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;53&quot;&gt;The Florida hacker paid a second person for services that involved accessing GitHub, a site widely used by programmers to store their code, to obtain credentials for access to Uber data stored elsewhere, one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;54&quot;&gt;GitHub said the attack did not involve a failure of its security systems. “Our recommendation is to never store access tokens, passwords, or other authentication or encryption keys in the code,” that company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;61&quot;&gt;‘SHOUT IT FROM THE ROOFTOPS’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;62&quot;&gt;Uber received an email last year from an anonymous person demanding money in exchange for user data, and the message was forwarded to the company’s bug bounty team in what was described as Uber’s routine practice for such solicitations, according to three sources familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;63&quot;&gt;Bug bounty programs are designed mainly to give security researchers an incentive to report weaknesses they uncover in a company’s software. But complicated scenarios can emerge when dealing with hackers who obtain information illegally or seek a ransom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;64&quot;&gt;Some companies choose not to report more aggressive intrusions to authorities on the grounds that it can be easier and more effective to negotiate directly with hackers in order to limit any harm to customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;65&quot;&gt;Uber’s $100,000 payout and silence on the matter at the time was extraordinary under such a program, according to Luta Security founder Katie Moussouris, a former HackerOne executive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;66&quot;&gt;“If it had been a legitimate bug bounty, it would have been ideal for everyone involved to shout it from the rooftops,” Moussouris said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;67&quot;&gt;Uber’s failure to report the breach to regulators, even though it may have felt it had dealt with the problem, was an error, according to people inside and outside the company who spoke to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;68&quot;&gt;“The creation of a bug bounty program doesn’t allow Uber, their bounty service provider, or any other company the ability to decide that breach notification laws don’t apply to them,” Moussouris said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;69&quot;&gt;Uber fired its chief security officer, Joe Sullivan, and a deputy, attorney Craig Clark, over their roles in the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;70&quot;&gt;“None of this should have happened, and I will not make excuses for it,” Khosrowshahi, said in a blog post announcing the hack last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;71&quot;&gt;Clark worked directly for Sullivan but also reported to Uber’s legal and privacy team, according to three people familiar with the arrangement. It is unclear whether Clark informed Uber’s legal department, which typically handled disclosure issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;72&quot;&gt;Sullivan and Clark did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;73&quot;&gt;In an August interview with Reuters, Sullivan, a former prosecutor and Facebook Inc (&lt;span id=&quot;“symbol_FB.O_0”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview/FB.O&quot;&gt;FB.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) security chief, said he integrated security engineers and developers at Uber “with our lawyers and our public policy team who know what regulators care about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;74&quot;&gt;Last week, three more top managers in Uber’s security unit resigned. One of them, physical security chief Jeff Jones, later told others he would have left anyway, sources told Reuters. Another of the three, senior security engineer Prithvi Rai, later agreed to stay in a new role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;75&quot;&gt;(The story is refiled to correct to 57 million users in second paragraph, showing figure is for both passengers and drivers.)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Volkswagen Official Gets 7-Year Term in Diesel-Emissions Cheating</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/business/oliver-schmidt-volkswagen.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/business/oliver-schmidt-volkswagen.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;338&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1787&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;Mr. Schmidt’s arrest in January, more than a year after the scandal erupted, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/09/business/volkswagen-emissions-scandal-oliver-schmidt.html&quot;&gt;something of a fluke&lt;/a&gt;. Having been transferred back to Germany, he came to the United States for a vacation with his wife and was seized as he waited for a departing flight in Miami. Why he risked arrest by traveling to the United States remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;327&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2114&quot;&gt;Mr. Schmidt had been a Volkswagen employee since 1997 and was named general manager of the company’s engineering and environmental office in Auburn Hills, Mich., in 2013. He was responsible for the automaker’s relations with the federal and California regulatory agencies that initially pursued the emissions-cheating case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;337&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2451&quot;&gt;Before imposing the sentence, Judge Cox admonished Mr. Schmidt for his actions and described him as a crucial figure in a wide-ranging plot. “You are a key conspirator responsible for the cover-up in the United States of a massive fraud perpetuated on the American consumer,” the judge said at the end of the nearly two-hour hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;215&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2666&quot;&gt;Prosecutors asserted that Mr. Schmidt had provided false information to federal agents after the Environmental Protection Agency uncovered the “defeat devices” that Volkswagen used to circumvent pollution rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;233&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2899&quot;&gt;Judge Cox said Mr. Schmidt’s effort to conceal the existence of the devices from regulators was hardly an isolated mistake. “You viewed the cover-up as an opportunity to shine and climb up the corporate ladder,” the judge said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;126&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3025&quot;&gt;Mr. Schmidt has played down his role in the development of the devices and in the company’s efforts to cover up its actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;312&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3337&quot;&gt;In his comments to the judge, Mr. Schmidt — his wrists shackled and wearing a red prison jumpsuit and black-rimmed reading glasses — said he accepted responsibility for his wrongdoing. “I only have to blame myself,” he said in German-accented English. “I made bad decisions, and for that I am sorry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;88&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3425&quot;&gt;Mr. Schmidt had sought to limit his sentence to 40 months in prison and a $100,000 fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;329&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3754&quot;&gt;In a letter to the judge before the sentencing, Mr. Schmidt said his loyalty to Volkswagen had led him to be “misused by my own company.” He cited a meeting in 2015 with a senior official at the California Air Resources Board at which he concealed the existence of software that allowed Volkswagen to cheat on emission tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;236&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3990&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;“A script, or talking points, I was directed to follow for that meeting was approved by management level supervisors at VW, including a high-ranking in-house lawyer, ” he said in the letter. “Regrettably, I agreed to follow it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;104&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4094&quot;&gt;Mr. Schmidt did not identify any Volkswagen superiors who might have pressured him to lie to regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;380&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4474&quot;&gt;Volkswagen moved to put the scandal behind it in the United States by agreeing this year to plead guilty to felony charges of illegally importing nearly 600,000 vehicles equipped with devices to circumvent emissions standards. It &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/business/energy-environment/volkswagen-diesel-emissions-sentencing.html&quot;&gt;paid $4.3 billion in penalties&lt;/a&gt; and was put on probation for three years, with a monitor overseeing its compliance with ethics and regulatory measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;247&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4721&quot;&gt;Other than Mr. Schmidt, only a company engineer, James Liang, has been sentenced in the United States in the matter, receiving a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/25/business/volkswagen-engineer-prison-diesel-cheating.html&quot;&gt;40-month term&lt;/a&gt; in August after pleading guilty to conspiring to defraud the government and violating the Clean Air Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;298&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5019&quot;&gt;Another figure in the American investigation, Zaccheo Pamio, an executive in the company’s Audi division, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/07/business/volkswagen-audi-diesel-emissions.html&quot;&gt;was arrested in Germany&lt;/a&gt; in July. As an Italian citizen, he faces possible extradition — unlike &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/13/business/volkswagen-diesel-emissions-executives.html&quot;&gt;five other executives&lt;/a&gt; indicted in the United States, all Germans based in their home country.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Steam is no longer supporting Bitcoin</title>
<link>http://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1464096684955433613</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1464096684955433613</guid>
<description>As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method on our platform due to high fees and volatility in the value of Bitcoin.&lt;p&gt;In the past few months we've seen an increase in the volatility in the value of Bitcoin and a significant increase in the fees to process transactions on the Bitcoin network. For example, transaction fees that are charged to the customer by the Bitcoin network have skyrocketed this year, topping out at close to $20 a transaction last week (compared to roughly $0.20 when we initially enabled Bitcoin). Unfortunately, Valve has no control over the amount of the fee. These fees result in unreasonably high costs for purchasing games when paying with Bitcoin. The high transaction fees cause even greater problems when the value of Bitcoin itself drops dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, the value of Bitcoin has been volatile, but the degree of volatility has become extreme in the last few months, losing as much as 25% in value over a period of days. This creates a problem for customers trying to purchase games with Bitcoin. When checking out on Steam, a customer will transfer x amount of Bitcoin for the cost of the game, plus y amount of Bitcoin to cover the transaction fee charged by the Bitcoin network. The value of Bitcoin is only guaranteed for a certain period of time so if the transaction doesn’t complete within that window of time, then the amount of Bitcoin needed to cover the transaction can change. The amount it can change has been increasing recently to a point where it can be significantly different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The normal resolution for this is to either refund the original payment to the user, or ask the user to transfer additional funds to cover the remaining balance. In both these cases, the user is hit with the Bitcoin network transaction fee again. This year, we’ve seen increasing number of customers get into this state. With the transaction fee being so high right now, it is not feasible to refund or ask the customer to transfer the missing balance (which itself runs the risk of underpayment again, depending on how much the value of Bitcoin changes while the Bitcoin network processes the additional transfer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, it has become untenable to support Bitcoin as a payment option. We may re-evaluate whether Bitcoin makes sense for us and for the Steam community at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will continue working to resolve any pending issues for customers who are impacted by existing underpayments or transaction fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- The Steam Team&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Antidote: CRDT-based distributed database</title>
<link>http://syncfree.github.io/antidote/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://syncfree.github.io/antidote/</guid>
<description>&lt;img class=&quot;docimage&quot; src=&quot;http://syncfree.github.io/antidote/images/company_logo_big.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your cloud-scale application must be highly available?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to serve millions of customers around the world with low latency responses?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are tired of fixing inconsistencies in your key-value store?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/oWUNCsFy-r0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-antidote&quot;&gt;Why Antidote?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional databases provide strong guarantees but are slow and unavailable under failures and network partition. Hence, they are not suitable for geo-replication. The alternatives are NoSQL-style databases which are fast and available even under network partition. They provide a low-level key-value interface and expose data inconsistencies due to asynchronous communication among the servers. It takes significant effort and expertise from programmers to deal with these inconsistencies and develop correct applications on top of these databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, consider that your application stores a counter which counts the number of ads displayed to a user. For scalability, the database replicates all data in different locations. What will be the value of the counter, when it is incremented at two locations at the same time? As an application programmer, you have to detect such concurrent updates and resolve conflicting modifications. Antidote provides features that aid programmers to write correct applications, while having the same performance and horizontal scalability as AP/NoSQL, from a single machine to geo-replicated deployments, with the added guarantees of Causal Highly-Available Transactions, and provable absence of data corruption due to concurrency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-3 col-sm-6&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;panel-body&quot; readability=&quot;30.724137931034&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;CRDTs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-level replicated data types that are designed to work correctly in the presence of concurrent updates and partial failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Highly Available Transactions (HATs)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, the application needs to maintain some relation between updates to different objects. Antidote provides causal consistency across all replicas, snapshot reads and atomic multi-object updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;We are a small 5-person enterprise software startup, operating in the data analytics/ML space. We are working on starting a proof-of-concept with a huge potential customer ($50+bn in revenue). We recently identified our first use case, and are ready to get into contract negotiations.
&lt;p&gt;But then they got back to us with an odd request: they want to see our source code (likely upon completion of the PoC). Given that our core IP is our models and algorithms, we are reluctant to agree. Their justification is: &quot;we want to see how your algorithms made their decisions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that they have lots of resources and are building up internal data science team. And yet it was pointed out to me that their goal might not necessarily be to outright steal our IP, but rather to cover their bases. But we are still worried they might be &quot;inspired&quot; by the parts they see and get their internal teams to replicate across other sites or use cases. And we don't have the resources to litigate, nor any way of knowing they do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My questions: 1) Has anybody run into a request like this? How would you respond? 2) How likely do you think their goal is to genuinely &quot;see what happens under the hood&quot; as opposed to replicate in the future? 3) Are there any legal protections we can put in place to prevent them from not just copy-pasting our code, but also from &quot;learning from it&quot; or so?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Millions Are Hounded for Debt They Don’t Owe. One Victim Fought Back</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-12-06/millions-are-hounded-for-debt-they-don-t-owe-one-victim-fought-back-with-a-vengeance</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-12-06/millions-are-hounded-for-debt-they-don-t-owe-one-victim-fought-back-with-a-vengeance</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;On the morning a debt collector threatened to rape his wife, Andrew Therrien was working from home, in a house with green shutters on a cul-de-sac in a small Rhode Island town. Tall and stocky, with a buzz cut and a square, friendly face, Therrien was a salesman for a promotions company. He’d always had an easy rapport with people over the phone, and on that day, in February 2015, he was calling food vendors to talk about grocery store giveaways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therrien was interrupted midpitch by a call from his wife. She’d gotten a voicemail from an authoritative-sounding man saying Therrien was in some kind of trouble. “I need to verify an address to present you with your formal claim,” the man had said. “Andrew Therrien, you are officially notified.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later, Therrien’s phone buzzed. It was the same guy. He gave his name as Charles Cartwright and said Therrien owed $700 on a payday loan. But Therrien knew he didn’t owe anyone anything. Suspecting a scam, he told Cartwright just what he thought of his scare tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cartwright hung up, then called back, mad. He said he wanted to meet face-to-face to teach Therrien a lesson.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Come on by, asshole,” Therrien says he replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will,” Cartwright said, “and I hope your wife is at home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s when he made the rape threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therrien got so angry he couldn’t think clearly. He wasn’t going to just let someone menace and disrespect his wife like that. He had to know who this Cartwright guy was, and his employer, too. Therrien wanted to make them pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, he worried that the call might not be a swindle. What if some misinformed loan shark really was coming for them? But Therrien didn’t have any real information he could take to the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he remembered Cartwright had left a number with his wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He dialed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere—at the top of a ladder of dirty debt collectors that Therrien would spend the next two years relentlessly climbing—a man named Joel Tucker had no idea what was coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;passage&quot;&gt;“You’ll never get your money back. You might as well get blood out of it”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;Earlier this year, I met Therrien, 33, at a Panera Bread restaurant in central Providence. He had reluctantly agreed to be interviewed, on the condition that I not reveal his hometown or his wife’s name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therrien had been caught up in a fraud known as phantom debt, where millions of Americans are hassled to pay back money they don’t owe. The concept is centuries old: Inmates of a New York debtors’ prison joked about it as early as 1800, in a newspaper they published called &lt;em&gt;Forlorn Hope&lt;/em&gt;. But systematic schemes to collect on fake debts started only about five years ago. It begins when someone scoops up troves of personal information that are available cheaply online—old loan applications, long-expired obligations, data from hacked accounts—and reformats it to look like a list of debts. Then they make deals with unscrupulous collectors who will demand repayment of the fictitious bills. Their targets are often poor and likely to already be getting confusing calls about other loans. The harassment usually doesn’t work, but some marks are convinced that because the collectors know so much, the debt must be real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is as simple as it is intractable. In 2012 a call center in India was busted for making 8 million calls in eight months to collect made-up bills. The Federal Trade Commission has since broken up at least 13 similar scams. In most cases, regulators weren’t able to identify the original perpetrators because the data files had been sold and repackaged so many times. Victims have essentially no recourse to do anything but take the abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most victims, that is. When the scammers started to hound Therrien, he hounded them right back. Obsessed with payback, he spent hundreds of hours investigating the dirty side of debt. By day he was still promoting ice cream brands and hiring models for liquor store tastings. But in his spare time, he was living out a revenge fantasy. He befriended loan sharks and blackmailed crooked collectors, getting them to divulge their suppliers, and then their suppliers above them. In method, Therrien was like a prosecutor flipping gangster underlings to get to lieutenants and then the boss. In spirit, he was a bit like Liam Neeson’s vigilante character in the movie &lt;em&gt;Taken&lt;/em&gt;—using unflagging aggression to obtain scraps of information and reverse-engineer a criminal syndicate. Therrien didn’t punch anyone in the head, of course. He was simply unstoppable over the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;When Therrien dialed the number Cartwright had left, a woman answered and said she worked for Lakefront Processing Solutions in Buffalo. She’d never heard of Charles Cartwright, though, and implied he must be some kind of freelancer or bounty hunter. Regardless, she said, Therrien could clear everything up by making a payment. Her records indicated that he owed a payday lender called Vista.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therrien had indeed once taken out a loan, but he didn’t think it was from Vista. He’d been selling copiers at the time, and when his boss stiffed him on a $20,000 commission, he turned to an online lender to make a car payment. Therrien says he paid back the debt promptly. He was offended by the Lakefront woman’s suggestion that he was a deadbeat. “I’m a person who believes in personal friggin’ responsibility,” Therrien tells me. “I signed an agreement. And I fulfilled my obligation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On his laptop, Therrien started digging. He found a securities filing saying Vista had merged with a company called That Marketing Solution Inc. After paying a few dollars to an online people-search service, he got its president on the line. “You sold my personal information to a bunch of thugs,” Therrien recalls telling the man. “I want to know why, and I want to know what you’re going to do about it.” Within hours, the company provided a letter saying that Therrien had never borrowed from Vista.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with proof the debt was invalid, Therrien turned back to Lakefront. More searches yielded a corporate parent, owned by two Buffalo men. Therrien called them, then their lawyer. When the lawyer stalled, Therrien bombarded him with more calls, at home and on his cell—enough to put Lakefront off him for good. (The parties eventually reached a confidential settlement, and Lakefront—whose name I found in a public record—declined to comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the morning after Cartwright’s call, Therrien’s fears of a psycho collector had been assuaged—no one had showed up at his house. But swatting down Lakefront turned out to be just the first round in a game of whack-a-mole. More collection agencies contacted him, his wife, his brother, even his grandparents. The calls made it clear to Therrien that an overarching force was at play. His name had to be getting on these lists somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each night, after his wife went to sleep, he cracked open his laptop to comb lawsuits, unearth filings, and uproot the owners of the agencies calling him. When he got names, he’d phone them, often surprising them at home, and make clear that he wouldn’t go away until they’d revealed who supplied their debt portfolios. “Here’s the deal,” he’d say. “I don’t really care about you. There’s a million guys like you out there. You’ll never get your money back. You might as well get blood out of it. Tell me what I need to know to put these guys in jail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, Therrien would make a small payment on the fake debt, then check bank records to see where it went. He found people with convictions for counterfeiting, stock fraud, drug dealing, and child molestation. He started a spreadsheet, Scums.xlsx, to keep track. On weekends he’d harangue them from his couch while watching New England Patriots games. He used persuasion techniques he’d learned selling copiers, some drawn from a book called &lt;em&gt;Getting Into Your Customer’s Head&lt;/em&gt;. On the phone, Therrien is a savant. He has an instinct for when to be a friend—one gruff payday lender tells me, sheepishly, that he simply doesn’t know why he speaks with Therrien so frequently—and when to be a bully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therrien would threaten to report the collectors to regulators unless they helped him figure out what was going on. “You are either with me in this, or you are against me,” he wrote to one man. Others he tried to shame. “If my intentions are right, I’ll have God on my side,” Therrien emailed one source. “You may not love poor people, but He does.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The targets were shocked by Therrien’s doggedness. In their world, complaints are common, but most victims give up after being promised they won’t be called again. One shady-debt player tells me he suspected Therrien was an undercover federal investigator because he’d gathered so much information on his business. “It’s an obsession, it’s unbelievable, an outright vigilante crusade,” another says. “It doesn’t seem to equal the harm that was done to him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therrien knew his fixation seemed odd. He didn’t tell his friends and family much about his nighttime activity. But the collectors’ threats brought back feelings of rage and fear that he’d struggled to suppress since childhood. He grew up in working-class Connecticut, where his father was a factory man and his mother had a series of part-time jobs. Therrien says they mistreated him and his brother, and he moved out at 16 after an incident he won’t discuss. He told me he regrets not doing more to protect his brother. (Therrien’s father is dead, and his mother denies she did anything wrong.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In college, Therrien worked at a J.Crew store, where a customer spotted his talent for sales and offered him a job. Therrien makes a good living now, and he takes pride in being a more responsible person than his parents—paying his bills on time, going to church on Sunday, and taking care of those close to him. “If it’s just about me, I don’t particularly give a f---,” he tells me, with an incongruous laugh. “You call my wife, and you call my grandparents? You just opened up a door that got really f---ing ugly, and now I’m going to make sure that I just ruin your life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;As more collectors yielded to Therrien’s persistence and talked, he dropped his pursuit of Charles Cartwright, concluding that it was an untraceable alias, and focused on understanding their business. Phantom debt, he learned, is blended with real debt in ways that are almost impossible to untangle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans are currently late on more than $600 billion in bills, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/research/2017/rp171114&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Federal Reserve research&lt;/a&gt;, and almost one person in 10 has a debt in collectors’ hands. The agencies recoup what they can and sell the rest down-market, so that iffier and iffier debt is bought by shadier and shadier individuals. Deception is common. Scammers often sell the same portfolios of debt, called “paper,” to several collection agencies at once, so a legitimate IOU gains illegitimate clones. Some inflate balances, a practice known as “overbiffing.” Others create “redo” lists—people who’ve settled their debt, but will be harassed again anyway. These rosters are actually more valuable, because the targets have proved willing to part with money over the phone. And then there are those who invent debts out of whole cloth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portfolios are combined and doctored until they contain thousands of entries. One collector told Therrien that he’d paid cash at a diner for a thumb drive with a database containing Therrien’s name. Some collectors told him they thought the files were partially legitimate; others knew their paper was completely falsified. Yet they continued to trade it, referring to the people they pursued as deadbeats and losers. The more Therrien learned, the more disgusted he grew with everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His search for the ur-source rarely traveled in a straight line. For a time, Therrien focused on Buffalo,one of the poorest cities in the U.S. and a hub for the collections industry—home to agencies that work the oldest, cheapest paper. Debt collector is a more common job there than bartender or construction worker, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As Therrien wore down as many Buffalo collectors as he could, one name kept surfacing: Joel Tucker, a former payday-loan mogul from Kansas City, Mo. By the summer of 2015, Therrien was convinced he’d found his guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;passage&quot;&gt;“Who are you?”&lt;br/&gt;“A person that you f---ed with too many times”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;Therrien needed an ally inside the Kansas City racket. He found one in Frampton “Ted” Rowland III, a middle-aged insurance-broker-turned-predatory-lender whose company was listed as the original creditor for one of Therrien’s supposed loans. When Therrien called, Rowland said he was sorry—and kept talking. His life was falling apart. He’d been sued by the FTC over his lending practices, he’d lost all his money, and his wife was leaving him. Therrien sympathized. He sensed Rowland was a good man who’d made a bad choice out of a desire to provide for his family. They started to speak regularly, and Rowland told Therrien he blamed Tucker for everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tucker had created the local industry with his two brothers. Scott, the oldest, was the brains. He’d served time in prison for a scam in which he’d pretended to work for JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co. The middle son, Blaine, was popular and a talented musician. Joel, tall and handsome, was a natural salesman. But when he was 21, he was selling furniture and working at a mini-mart, so hard up that he got arrested for bouncing a $12 check. (The case was dismissed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mid-1990s, Scott opened a payday-loan store and gave his brothers jobs. Lending money to people who don’t have any is surprisingly profitable. In states where such stores are legal, such as Missouri, they’re more common than McDonald’s franchises. But in the 15 states where such stores are against the law, there are millions of desperate people willing to pay for fast cash and no one to give it to them. Scott pioneered what he thought was a clever legal loophole that would give him access to that market: He created websites that were owned on paper by an American Indian tribe, which could claim sovereign immunity from regulators. Those sites charged as much as $150 interest on a two-week, $500 loan—an annualized interest rate of about 700 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loophole was ridiculously lucrative. Scott’s operation generated $2 billion in revenue from 2003 to 2012. He bought a private jet and spent more than $60 million to start his own professional Ferrari racing team. Around 2005, Joel split to start a company that would allow anyone to get into online payday lending—supplying software to process applications and loans and offering access to a steady stream of customers. All the clients had to bring was money and a willingness to bypass state law. Word spread around Kansas City’s country clubs and private schools that if you wanted to get rich, Joel Tucker was your man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Tucker’s help, one property management executive and his son, a general contractor, started a lender that saw $161 million in revenue over eight years. An investor presentation from that period shows that Tucker was personally clearing tens of millions of dollars in profit per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of his clients was Rowland, until the gravy train crashed in 2013. Under pressure from regulators, banks stopped doing business with the sketchiest payday lenders, making it hard for them to issue loans and collect payments. In 2014 federal authorities raided Rowland’s office, and the FBI began investigating the Tucker brothers. Blaine committed suicide by jumping off a parking garage in 2014; Scott was charged two years later with racketeering, and prosecutors called his tribal arrangement a sham. (He declined to comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time Therrien came looking for Joel Tucker in the fall of 2015, he’d become a hard man to find. Twice divorced, he was moving from place to place, ducking his creditors. A booking photo from the time when he was briefly imprisoned for failing to show up for court in an unrelated lawsuit shows him with bristly gray hair and dark circles under deep-set blue eyes. Therrien couldn’t find a working phone number for him—not even when he reached his 81-year-old mother, Norma. She claimed not to know where he was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therrien’s tactics grew more intense, mirroring those of the debt collectors he loathed. As he had in Buffalo, he developed a network of sources in Kansas City, figuring out who hated whom and playing them off each other. He got a burner app that provided disposable numbers for his smartphone, with any area code he wanted. He called wives, widows, business partners, even a waitress who’d once worked at a restaurant the Tuckers owned. He’d have his sources drive by places where he thought Tucker might be living, to look for his car. He told one broker’s mother-in-law that she should investigate who her daughter was married to. Therrien acknowledges that sometimes he went too far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By November 2015 he developed a simple theory. Tucker’s business had given him access to a huge database of people who’d applied for loans—including, just maybe, the one Therrien had taken out in his copier-selling days. What if, when Tucker was broke and needed money, he’d taken applicants’ personal information, invented loan balances, and sold the list as a portfolio of delinquent debt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therrien took his hypothesis to the FBI and FTC. His emails were breathless and confusing, but the authorities were patient, taking his calls and talking to him at length. It was clear they knew about Tucker, but Therrien got frustrated by what he saw as inaction. “There are millions of people out there being threatened daily by these actions and I’m doing my part to try and stop it,” he wrote to an FTC investigator in early 2016, begging him to hold Tucker accountable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;passage&quot;&gt;“I’m giving you the opportunity to come clean”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;January 2016 saw a breakthrough: A former employee of Tucker’s agreed to arrange a call between him and Therrien to clear the air. Therrien couldn’t believe his unseen antagonist was willing to talk. So anxious he couldn’t sit down, he set up a recording device in his home office, put his phone on speaker, and called.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tucker seemed hyper and defensive, telling Therrien that if any of the portfolios he’d sold now contained phantom debt, they must have been doctored after leaving his hands. “F---ing shame on them,” he said. “Wasn’t me. It had to have been them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therrien was trying to hold back his anger, but his voice wavered. He wanted to impress Tucker, mentioning tidbits he knew about his business. Tucker didn’t understand why Therrien, this guy he’d never met, was so extravagantly invested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ll tell you why I care,” Therrien said calmly. “I’ll tell you why I care. I believe, and I’m just telling you what I believe, you sold my personal information 21 separate times. I’ve gotten close to 100 f---ing calls, and because I’ve gotten those 100 calls from scumbag collectors that you facilitated, I’m going to make sure that that kind of shit ends now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tucker was incredulous: “You think this is my fault?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You got desperate because you spent two dollars for every dollar you had,” Therrien said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What are you talking about? Are you trying to micromanage my life? You don’t know jack shit about me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I know what happened. You f---ing stole money from people,” Therrien said. “I’m giving you the opportunity to come clean.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know who you are, Andrew,” Tucker said. “Who are you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A person that you f---ed with too many times.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Therrien played the tape for me, I was amazed at how fluently he channeled emotion—his own and Tucker’s—to get what he wanted. Incredibly, by the end of the half-hour call, Tucker was offering to help Therrien collect evidence about crimes committed by other people in the payday-loan business. “We need to get this stuff resolved,” Tucker said on the tape, with a sigh. “’Cause this—it’s not healthy for anybody.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two men started talking and texting a few times a week. “I think he has a mental illness that allows him to think he did nothing wrong,” Therrien told me. (Tucker didn’t respond to most of my emailed questions and kept putting off interview requests. “Lies are not stories,” he wrote in one email. He said that any debt he’d sold was legitimate.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tucker’s denials made Therrien hate him more, but Therrien masked his feelings to keep the conversation going. The one-year anniversary of his quest was approaching, and he wanted real evidence of wrongdoing—something Tucker couldn’t deny and officials couldn’t ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therrien soon obtained two crucial sets of documents to that end. In March 2016 he flew to California to meet a debt broker, who handed over some contracts Tucker had signed. Separately, Therrien received an email from the manager of a collection agency, to whose conscience he’d spent weeks appealing. The email, whose subject line read “Have faith in the good in heart,” included actual phantom-debt files, with names and Social Security numbers. The metadata yielded a new name: Rob Harsh, Tucker’s IT guy. (The author of the email died of a drug overdose a few months later.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2016, Therrien emailed his discoveries to the FTC. A lawyer replied right away: “Andrew, we need to talk about this.” Therrien also gave his intel to some private lawyers who were going after Tucker in Texas. They contacted Harsh, and in August 2016 he submitted an affidavit to the court. Harsh, who declined to comment for this story, testified that Tucker had asked him to manipulate a database of almost 8 million payday-loan applications, writing in a made-up lender and adding an amount owed of $300 for each person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therrien had been right all along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;Vindication didn’t make Therrien happy, not even when the FTC suit against Rowland’s company took a karmic swerve that drew in Tucker, directing him to return $30 million he’d received in ill-gotten profits from the business. Tucker told the court he was broke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Rowland was spiraling. He confided in Therrien that he was considering suicide, and one day that summer he called Therrien to say goodbye. “Don’t do anything stupid,” Therrien texted him afterward. “I may be callous with you lately but I still care and don’t want anything bad to happen.” Therrien told me he’d informed the police of Rowland’s plan and that they had intervened. But that October, Rowland shot himself. His death added to Therrien’s outrage at Tucker and other predatory lenders like him who hadn’t faced any real legal consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in December 2016, the FTC sued Tucker for selling phantom debt. According to the regulator, everything had happened pretty much as Therrien imagined: Tucker had invented more than 7.7 million fake debts and sold them to a series of middlemen for $4.2 million. This September, a judge ruled for the agency, ordering Tucker to pay back that money on top of the $30 million he already owed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC has never credited Therrien, and Michael Tankersley, an agency lawyer, declined to discuss their interactions. But Tankersley told me that Harsh and the California broker were two key sources of information establishing Tucker’s wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therrien, as usual, was unsatisfied. He was still getting calls from collectors, for one thing. And he felt that if he’d done a better job investigating, Tucker would be facing criminal charges—not a civil fine he’d never end up paying. Therrien has stayed in touch with the FBI’s Kansas City office. An FBI spokeswoman declines to say whether Tucker is being investigated, but three of his associates told me that agents had contacted them about his debt sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the ruling against Tucker, Therrien heard from him for the first time in months, and they started talking again. Amid their conversations, which were recorded, Tucker’s brother, Scott, was convicted on all 14 charges he faced. Without directly asking Therrien to drop his vendetta, Tucker seemed to be pleading for mercy. “I’ve f---ing had enough harm done,” he said. “I’ve lost a brother. Got a brother going to prison. Put it this way, Andrew. I’m tired, buddy. I’m f---ing tired.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m tired too,” Therrien replied, “because I’m still getting harassed by these motherf---ers.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>PostgreSQL HA cluster failure: a post-mortem</title>
<link>https://gocardless.com/blog/incident-review-api-and-dashboard-outage-on-10th-october/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://gocardless.com/blog/incident-review-api-and-dashboard-outage-on-10th-october/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This post represents the collective work of our Core Infrastructure team's investigation into our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gocardless-status.com/incidents/xwqmtlxy9btj&quot;&gt;API and Dashboard outage&lt;/a&gt; on 10 October 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a payments company, we take reliability very seriously. We hope that the transparency in technical write-ups like this reflects that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have included a high-level summary of the incident, and a more detailed technical breakdown of what happened, our investigation, and changes we've made since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the afternoon of 10 October 2017, we experienced an outage of our API and Dashboard, lasting 1 hour and 50 minutes. Any requests made during that time failed, and returned an error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cause of the incident was a hardware failure on our primary database node, combined with unusual circumstances that prevented our database cluster automation from promoting one of the replica database nodes to act as the new primary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This failure to promote a new primary database node extended an outage that would normally last 1 or 2 minutes to one that lasted almost 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our database setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we start, it's helpful to have a high-level view of how we store data at GoCardless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of our most critical data&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gocardless.com/blog/incident-review-api-and-dashboard-outage-on-10th-october/#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is stored in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/&quot;&gt;Postgres&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We run Postgres in a cluster of 3 nodes, with a primary, 1 synchronous replica and 1 asynchronous replica. This means that we always have at least 2 copies of every piece of data by the time we respond successfully to an API request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To manage the promotion of a new primary node in the event of machine failure, we run a piece of software called &lt;a href=&quot;https://clusterlabs.org/pacemaker.html&quot;&gt;Pacemaker&lt;/a&gt; on each node in the cluster. Clients, such as our Ruby on Rails applications, connect to the primary node&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gocardless.com/blog/incident-review-api-and-dashboard-outage-on-10th-october/#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; using a virtual IP address (VIP) that is also managed by Pacemaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put together, it looks a little like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gocardless.com/blog/images/postgres-outage-oct-2017/cluster-intro/basic-cluster.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the primary node fails, the cluster notices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gocardless.com/blog/images/postgres-outage-oct-2017/cluster-intro/cluster-with-failure.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;It promotes the synchronous replica, which is guaranteed to have a copy of every write (e.g. new payment) that the primary accepted. It also sets up the old asynchronous replica as the new synchronous replica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gocardless.com/blog/images/postgres-outage-oct-2017/cluster-intro/cluster-after-promotion.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the VIP is moved across, applications can carry on their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gocardless.com/blog/images/postgres-outage-oct-2017/cluster-intro/cluster-after-vip-move.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) then adds a new replica back into the cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Incident timeline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how did all this go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All times in this section are in British Summer Time (UTC+1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;15:09&lt;/em&gt;: Our monitoring detects the total outage of our API and Dashboard; engineers begin to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;15:11&lt;/em&gt;: We see evidence of a disk array failure on the primary. We are unsure why the cluster hasn't already failed over to the synchronous replica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;15:17&lt;/em&gt;: We power off the broken primary Postgres node. This is done so that we don't have a machine in the cluster that is online, but with a broken disk array. We believe that with only the synchronous and asynchronous nodes online, the cluster software will promote a new primary. It quickly becomes clear that this is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;15:18&lt;/em&gt;: We clear the error counts (&lt;code&gt;crm resource cleanup&lt;/code&gt;) in Pacemaker to prompt it to rediscover the state of the Postgres instances. Doing so has no effect. The cluster will not promote the synchronous replica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spend the next hour trying a variety of approaches to promote a new primary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our last few attempts centre around editing the configuration on the synchronous replica to try to promote it ourselves. We put the Pacemaker cluster into maintenance mode (&lt;code&gt;crm configure property maintenance-mode=true&lt;/code&gt;), remove the configuration flag that tells Postgres to be a replica from &lt;code&gt;recovery.conf&lt;/code&gt;, and bring the cluster out of maintenance mode. Every time, it brings the replica back with its original &lt;code&gt;recovery.conf&lt;/code&gt;, and we are left with no primary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;16:18&lt;/em&gt;: We decide that our attempts at this approach have run on for too long, and that we need to try something else. We set the cluster into maintenance mode one last time, configure the synchronous replica to be a primary, and start Postgres ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the cluster also manages the VIP, and we've set it into maintenance mode, we reconfigure our backend applications to connect to the actual IP address of the new primary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;16:46&lt;/em&gt;: Our manually promoted primary Postgres node is working, and the configuration changes are being rolled out to our applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;16:59&lt;/em&gt;: Our monitoring systems confirm that our API and Dashboard are back up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The immediate fallout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having brought our systems back online, our next priority was to restore the database cluster to its usual level of redundancy. This meant bootstrapping a third node as an asynchronous replica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Pacemaker was still in maintenance mode, there would be no automatic failover if a machine were to fail now. We believed we were likely to be running this manually-managed setup for a while&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gocardless.com/blog/incident-review-api-and-dashboard-outage-on-10th-october/#fn3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and in the event of our primary failing, we wanted to be able to promote the synchronous replica as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to introduce another VIP, to be managed manually by the infrastructure team. In the event of our primary failing, we would promote the synchronous replica and move the VIP over ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this was an incident triggered by a disk array failure, out of caution we spent some time verifying the integrity of our data. After running every test we could think of, we found no evidence of data corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once that was done and we felt safe with the GoCardless services running as they were, we started planning our next steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The following weeks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day after the incident, the whole team sat down to discuss two issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why did our Pacemaker cluster fail to elect a new primary database node?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we move back to having Pacemaker managing our cluster, now that we're in this manually-managed state?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that discussion, we decided that we'd taken too much manual intervention on our existing database cluster to be confident in bringing back the Pacemaker automation there. We decided that we'd provision a new cluster, replicate data into it, and switch traffic over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We split up into two subteams - one trying to reproduce the failure, and the other working out how we'd move over to a new database cluster with minimal disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reproducing the failure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be confident in a new cluster, we needed to understand why the existing one didn't promote a new primary, and make changes to fix that issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, we did this by analysing the logs of the components involved in the failure. From that analysis, we pulled out several factors that looked like they could be relevant to reproducing the issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID&quot;&gt;RAID&lt;/a&gt; controller logged the simultaneous loss of 3 disks from the array. All subsequent read and write operations against it failed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Linux kernel set the filesystem backed by that controller into read-only mode. Given the state of the array, even reads weren't possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Pacemaker cluster correctly observed that Postgres was unhealthy on the primary node. It repeatedly attempted to promote a new primary, but each time it couldn't decide where that primary should run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the synchronous replica - the one that should have become the new primary - one of Postgres's subprocesses crashed around the time of the disk array failure on the primary. When this happens, Postgres terminates the rest of its subprocesses and restarts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After that restart, the synchronous replica kept trying to restore a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/wal-intro.html&quot;&gt;Write-Ahead Log&lt;/a&gt; (WAL) file through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/archive-recovery-settings.html#RESTORE-COMMAND&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;restore_command&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. On each attempt, it failed with a message stating that the file was invalid (more on this later).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot to unpick, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the complexity involved, it was clear that we'd only get to an answer in a reasonable amount of time if we could repeatedly break a cluster in slightly different ways and see if we could get it to break in the same way our production cluster did on 10 October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, as part of some unrelated work we'd done recently, we had a version of the cluster that we could run inside Docker containers. We used it to help us build a script that mimicked the failures we saw in production. Being able to rapidly turn clusters up and down let us iterate on that script quickly, until we found a combination of events that broke the cluster in just the right way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A red herring: the invalid WAL file&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the log entries that stood out, and was a real cause of concern for a while, was the synchronous replica failing to restore a WAL file through its &lt;code&gt;restore_command&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick bit of background for those not familiar with Postgres: the Write-Ahead Log is how Postgres records everything you ask it to write (e.g. &lt;code&gt;INSERT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;UPDATE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DELETE&lt;/code&gt; queries). This log provides strong guarantees of those writes not being lost if Postgres crashes, and is also used to keep replicas in sync with the primary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways the WAL can be used: through streaming replication, and through &lt;code&gt;archive_command&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;restore_command&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In streaming replication, replicas establish an ongoing connection to the primary, which sends them any WAL it generates. If you specify that the replication should be synchronous, it waits for the replica to confirm that it's received the WAL before returning from the query that generated it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;archive_command&lt;/code&gt;, Postgres lets you specify a shell command that will be executed every time a chunk of WAL is generated on the primary. It makes the file name available to the command you specify, so that you can choose what to do with the file. Similarly, &lt;code&gt;restore_command&lt;/code&gt; runs on replicas, and passes you the name of the next WAL file the database expects to replay, so you can copy it from wherever you archived it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's common to use both streaming replication and &lt;code&gt;archive_command&lt;/code&gt; in combination. Streaming repication keeps your replicas in sync with the most recent changes, and &lt;code&gt;archive_command&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;restore_command&lt;/code&gt; can be used to bootstrap nodes that are further behind by pulling in older WAL files from an archive external to the cluster (e.g. when you want to bootstrap a new node by restoring your last full backup then replaying WAL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what happened during the incident? It turned out that as a final act, the server with the RAID controller issue archived an invalid WAL file to our backup server. When the Postgres subprocess crash caused a restart on the synchronous replica, that Postgres instance came back up and ran its &lt;code&gt;restore_command&lt;/code&gt;, pulling in the invalid WAL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postgres's internal validation checks saw that the WAL file was invalid, and discarded it. In terms of the data, that didn't matter! That node &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; had a good copy of those writes, as it was doing streaming synchronous replication from the primary at the time of the failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We matched the log line from the validation failure against the Postgres source code, and spent a lot of time reproducing the exact same type of invalid WAL in our local container setup. Keep in mind that it's a binary format, and the contents are fairly dynamic - not the easiest thing to break in a repeatable way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, we figured out that it played no part in the Pacemaker cluster's inability to promote a new primary. At least we'd learned a little more about the internals of Postgres!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;So then, what was it?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through a process of elimination, we were able to remove steps from the script until we were left with three conditions that were necessary for the cluster to break:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;15.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacemaker setting: &lt;code&gt;default-resource-stickiness&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, Pacemaker doesn't assign a penalty to moving resources (such as a Postgres database process, or a VIP) to different machines. For services like Postgres, where moving a resource (e.g. the VIP that the clients are connected to) causes disruption, this isn't the behaviour we want. To combat this, we set the &lt;code&gt;default-resource-stickiness&lt;/code&gt; parameter to a non-zero value, so that Pacemaker will consider other options before moving a resource that is already running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacemaker resource: Backup VIP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of another piece of work to reduce load on the primary node, we'd added another VIP to the cluster. The idea was that this VIP would never be located on the primary, so the backup process would always connect to a replica, freeing up capacity for read operations on the primary. We set a constraint on this VIP so that it would never run on the same server as the Postgres primary. In Pacemaker terms, we set up a colocation rule with a &lt;code&gt;-INF&lt;/code&gt; (negative infinity) preference to locate the Backup VIP and the Postgres primary on the same server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of the incident, the Backup VIP was running on the synchronous replica - the node that Pacemaker should have promoted to primary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure condition: two processes crashing at once&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the configuration above, crashing the Postgres process on the primary wasn't enough to reproduce our production incident. The only way to get the cluster into a state where it would never elect a new primary was to crash one of Postgres' subprocesses on the synchronous replica, which we saw in the production logs from the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three of these conditions were necessary to reproduce the failure. Removing the &lt;code&gt;default-resource-stickiness&lt;/code&gt; or the Backup VIP led to the cluster successfully promoting a new primary, even with the two processes crashing almost simultaneously. Similarly, crashing only the Postgres process on the primary led to the cluster successfully promoting the synchronous replica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent some time testing different changes to our Pacemaker configuration, and ran into a surprising fix. Somehow, the &lt;code&gt;-INF&lt;/code&gt; colocation rule between the Backup VIP and the Postgres primary was interfering with the promotion process, even though there was another node - the asynchronous replica - where the Backup VIP could run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out that specifying the colocation rule for the Backup VIP the opposite way round worked just fine. Instead of specifying a rule with a &lt;code&gt;-INF&lt;/code&gt; preference between the Backup VIP and the Postgres primary, we could specify an &lt;code&gt;INF&lt;/code&gt; preference between the Backup VIP and a replica. When specified that way round, the cluster promotes the synchronous replica just fine under the same failure conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Moving to a new database cluster&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst this investigation was going on, the other half of the team were figuring out how to migrate from our manually managed cluster to a new cluster managed once again by Pacemaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for us, we had some prior work we could turn to here. We've &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAkNBiZzEX8&quot;&gt;previously spoken about&lt;/a&gt; our approach to performing zero-downtime failover within a cluster. The script that coordinates that is publicly available in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gocardless/our-postgresql-setup#running-a-zero-downtime-migration&quot;&gt;this GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk goes into more detail, but the relevant part isn't too hard to describe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as Postgres and Pacemaker, we also run a copy of PgBouncer on each of the nodes in our database cluster. We introduce a second VIP as a layer of indirection. Clients (e.g. our Ruby on Rails applications) connect to this new PgBouncer VIP. PgBouncer, in turn, connects to the original Postgres VIP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gocardless.com/blog/images/postgres-outage-oct-2017/pgbouncer-intro/add-pgbouncer.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's possible to pause all incoming queries at PgBouncer. When you do that, it puts them into a queue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gocardless.com/blog/images/postgres-outage-oct-2017/pgbouncer-intro/pgbouncer-pause.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can then promote a new primary and move the Postgres VIP to it. Note that the VIP the clients are connecting to - the PgBouncer VIP - doesn't need to move, so the clients experience no disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gocardless.com/blog/images/postgres-outage-oct-2017/pgbouncer-intro/move-vip.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the cluster has finished promoting the new node, we tell PgBouncer to resume traffic, and it sends the queued queries to the new primary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gocardless.com/blog/images/postgres-outage-oct-2017/pgbouncer-intro/pgbouncer-resume.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We needed to adapt this procedure a little. The automation that performs it is designed to migrate between different nodes in the same cluster, not two separate clusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subteam responsible for getting us into a new cluster spent the next couple of weeks making those adjustments and performing practice runs. Once they were totally comfortable, we put together a plan to do it in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrapping up the incident&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a plan in place, and the confidence that we'd understood and fixed the issue which stopped our cluster from failing over on 10 October, we were ready to go. Even with all the testing we'd done, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gocardless-status.com/incidents/g090g7s1hqwc&quot;&gt;announced a maintenance window&lt;/a&gt; as a precaution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, everything went as planned on the night, and we migrated to our new database cluster without a hitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decommissioned the old cluster, and closed the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no getting away from the size of this incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We feel an immense duty to everyone who trusts GoCardless as their payments provider. We took some time to think through what we'd learned from this incident, with a focus on how we could improve our reliability in the future. Some of the key items we came up with were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;18.148433487417&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seemingly simple Pacemaker configuration can lead to extremely unusual behaviour&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface, defining a rule that says two resources &lt;em&gt;must not&lt;/em&gt; run together seems like it would be the opposite of defining a rule that says two resources &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; run together. In reality, they cause the system to behave in entirely different ways in certain failure conditions. We can take this knowledge into any future work we do with Pacemaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unrelatedly, but conveniently, we're about to move away from using VIPs to direct traffic to specific Postgres instances. Instead we'll be running proxies on the application servers that direct traffic to the right node based on the state of the cluster. This will drastically reduce the number of resources managed by Pacemaker, in turn reducing the potential for weird behaviour in the cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5.6265560165975&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some bugs will only be surfaced through fault injection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A misconfiguration that only surfaces when two processes crash at almost the same time isn't one that you're going to find through basic tests or day-to-day operations. We've done some fault injection as part of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://gocardless.com/blog/game-days-at-gc/&quot;&gt;game day exercises&lt;/a&gt;, but there's always more you can do in that area. Harsher tests of the Postgres cluster, and automation like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/SimianArmy/wiki/Chaos-Monkey&quot;&gt;Chaos Monkey&lt;/a&gt; that continually injects failure are both ideas we're keen to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;13.846394984326&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automation erodes knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that when your automation successfully handles failures for two years, your skills in manually controlling the infrastructure below it atrophy. There's no &quot;one size fits all&quot; here. It's easy to say &quot;just write a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runbook&quot;&gt;runbook&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, but if multiple years go by before you next need it, it's almost guaranteed to be out-of-date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are definitely ways to combat this. One possibility we're thinking of is adding arbitrary restrictions to some of our game day exercises (e.g. &quot;this cluster is down, the automation has failed, you can't diagnose the problem, and need to bring the service back another way&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The elephant in the room&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're sure some of you are asking why we even run our own Postgres instances when there are hosted options out there. We couldn't end this write-up without talking about that a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do periodically consider the options out there for managed Postgres services. Until recently, they were somewhat lacking in a few areas we care about. Without turning this article into a provider comparison, it's only a recent development for any provider to offer &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-aurora-update-spatial-indexing-and-zero-downtime-patching/&quot;&gt;zero-downtime patch upgrades of Postgres&lt;/a&gt;, which is something &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAkNBiZzEX8&quot;&gt;we've been doing&lt;/a&gt; for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing that's made us rule out managed Postgres services so far is that most of our our infrastructure is in a bare-metal hosting provider. The added latency between that provider's datacentres and a hosted Postgres service would cause some fairly drastic re-work for our application developers, who can currently assume a latency to Postgres of a millisecond or lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, nothing is set in stone. Our hosting situation can change over time, and so can the offerings of the various hosting providers out there. We'll keep our eyes on it, and perhaps one day wave goodbye to running Postgres clusters ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd like to apologise one last time for this incident. We know how much trust people put in their payment providers, and we strive to run a reliable service that reinforces that trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we strongly believe in learning from failure when it does happen. It's encouraging to see that &lt;a href=&quot;https://landing.google.com/sre/book/chapters/postmortem-culture.html&quot;&gt;blameless post-mortems&lt;/a&gt; are becoming increasingly common in operations disciplines (whether you happen to call that DevOps, SRE, or something else). We hope you've found this one interesting and useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find us at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GoCardlessEng&quot;&gt;@GoCardlessEng&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter if you've got comments or questions. We'll try to answer them as best we can!&lt;/p&gt;

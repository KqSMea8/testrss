&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tinc-vpn.org/news/&quot;&gt;More news…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;whatistinc&quot;&gt;What is tinc?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tinc is a Virtual Private Network (VPN) daemon that uses tunnelling and encryption to create a secure private network between hosts on the Internet. tinc is Free Software and licensed under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html&quot;&gt;GNU General Public License&lt;/a&gt; version 2 or later. Because the VPN appears to the IP level network code as a normal network device, there is no need to adapt any existing software. This allows VPN sites to share information with each other over the Internet without exposing any information to others. In addition, tinc has the following features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encryption, authentication and compression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;All traffic is optionally compressed using zlib or LZO, and LibreSSL or OpenSSL is used to encrypt the traffic and protect it from alteration with message authentication codes and sequence numbers.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automatic full mesh routing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Regardless of how you set up the tinc daemons to connect to each other, VPN traffic is always (if possible) sent directly to the destination, without going through intermediate hops.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NAT traversal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;As long as one node in the VPN allows incoming connections on a public IP address (even if it is a dynamic IP address), tinc will be able to do NAT traversal, allowing direct communication between peers.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easily expand your VPN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;When you want to add nodes to your VPN, all you have to do is add an extra configuration file, there is no need to start new daemons or create and configure new devices or network interfaces.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ability to bridge ethernet segments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;You can link multiple ethernet segments together to work like a single segment, allowing you to run applications and games that normally only work on a LAN over the Internet.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runs on many operating systems and supports IPv6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Currently Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, OS X, Solaris, Windows 2000, XP, Vista and Windows 7 and 8 platforms are supported. See our section about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tinc-vpn.org/platforms&quot;&gt;supported platforms&lt;/a&gt; for more information about the state of the ports. tinc has also full support for IPv6, providing both the possibility of tunneling IPv6 traffic over its tunnels and of creating tunnels over existing IPv6 networks.&lt;/dd&gt;

<title>Googlebot’s JavaScript random() function is deterministic</title>
<link>http://www.tomanthony.co.uk/blog/googlebot-javascript-random/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.tomanthony.co.uk/blog/googlebot-javascript-random/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I was conducting some experiments on how Googlebot parses and renders Javascript, and I came across a couple of interesting things about the way it does so. The first is that Googlebot’s &lt;code&gt;Math.random()&lt;/code&gt; function produces an entirely deterministic series. I created a small script which uses this identify Google in an obfuscated fashion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.tomanthony.co.uk/fun/fetch_and_render.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tomanthony.co.uk/fun/googlebot_puzzle.html&quot;&gt;http://www.tomanthony.co.uk/fun/googlebot_puzzle.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time Googlebot calls &lt;code&gt;Math.random()&lt;/code&gt; the result will always be &lt;code&gt;0.14881141134537756&lt;/code&gt;, the second call will always be &lt;code&gt;0.19426893815398216&lt;/code&gt;. The script I linked to above simply uses this fact but obfuscates it a little and ‘seed’ it with something that doesn’t look too arbitrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Crawling at Google Scale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the amount of work Google have to undergo to crawl the whole web AND now run Javascript. Optimisations will need to be abundant, and I imagine that having a deterministic random number function is probably:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Faster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More secure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predictable – Googlebot can trust a page will render the same on each visit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Speeding up the clock…&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Googlebot also seems to run Javascript with a sped up clock, which makes sense. Why actually wait 5 seconds when you are a bot? So Google actually runs the timer a lot faster. If you create a simple ticker script and put it through the Google Search Console ‘Fetch &amp;amp; Render’ function it returns almost instantly, but with results looking like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.tomanthony.co.uk/fun/googlebot_time.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second date is a date from the future! Marty McFly would be proud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Since when?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did wonder if the random number generation sometimes updates, but a Google search for &lt;code&gt;0.14881141134537756&lt;/code&gt; turns up over 18,000 results, so it seems like it is quite stable. After discovering this I Google about a bit and found &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9529782&quot;&gt;an old Hacker News comment&lt;/a&gt; by ‘KMag’:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, some SEO figured out that random() was always returning 0.5. I’m not sure if anyone figured out that JavaScript always saw the date as sometime in the Summer of 2006, but I presume that has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it seems things were similar to this for some time now, but instead of &lt;code&gt;random()&lt;/code&gt; always returning &lt;code&gt;0.5&lt;/code&gt;, it became a deterministic series. The date is actually accurate initially, but can go into the future, as seen above. KMag went on to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope they now set the random seed and the date using a keyed cryptographic hash of all of the loaded javascript and page text, so it’s deterministic but very difficult to game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which doesn’t seem to be the case, but I’m unsure this allows you to do much you couldn’t do based on User-Agent / IP, but perhaps does allow you to do it with some plausible deniability!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;If you want to reach me hit me up on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TomAnthonySEO&quot;&gt;@TomAnthonySEO&lt;/a&gt; or at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.distilled.net/&quot;&gt;Distilled&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The web page has since been taken down – one reason why I’m a bit of a digital hoarder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It specified some of the common issues experienced from Windows 3.1’s Program Manager shell and looked at the potential of developing a separate shell for ‘beginners’. Admittedly my inclination was that this was possibly inspired by Apple’s At Ease program that was reasonably popular during the System 7 days. I remember At Ease well during my primary school years, so kids couldn’t mess with the hard disk in Finder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here’s what Kent had to say verbatim in his paper titled “The Windows 95 User Interface: A Case Study in Usability Engineering” so it’s not lost altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of the user interface for a large commercial software product like Microsoft® Windows 95 involves many people, broad design goals, and an aggressive work schedule. This design briefing describes how the usability engineering principles of iterative design and problem tracking were successfully applied to make the development of the UI more manageable. Specific design problems and their solutions are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iterative design, Microsoft Windows, problem tracking, rapid prototyping, usability engineering, usability testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows 95 is a comprehensive upgrade to the Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups 3.11 products. Many changes have been made in almost every area of Windows, with the user interface being no exception. This paper discusses the design team, its goals and process then explains how usability engineering principles such as iterative design and problem tracking were applied to the project, using specific design problems and their solutions as examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design Team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Windows 95 user interface design team was formed in October, 1992 during the early stages of the project. I joined the team as an adjunct member, to provide usability services, in December 1992. The design team was truly interdisciplinary, with people trained in product design, graphic design, usability testing, and computer science. The number of people oscillated during the project but was approximately twelve. The software developers dedicated to implementing the user interface accounted for another twelve or so people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design Goals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design team was chartered with two very broad goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make Windows easier to &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt; for people just getting started with computers and Windows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make Windows easier to &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; for people who already use computers-both the typical Windows 3.1 user and the advanced, or “power”, Windows 3.1 user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With over 50 million units of Windows 3.1 and 3.11 installed plus a largely-untapped home market, it was clear from the outset that the task of making a better product was not going to be a trivial exercise. Without careful design and testing, we were likely to make a product that improved usability for some users and worsened it for millions of other users (existing or potential). We understood fairly well the problems that intermediate and advanced users had but we knew little about problems beginning users had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given very broad design goals and an aggressive schedule for shipping the product (approximately 18 months to design and code the user interface) we knew from the outset that a traditional “waterfall” style development process would not allow us sufficient flexibility to attain the best-possible solution. In fact, we were concerned that the traditional approach would yield a very unusable system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the “waterfall” approach, the design of the system is compartmentalized (usually limited to a specification writing phase) and usability testing typically occurs near the end of the process, during quality assurance activities. We recognized that we needed much more opportunity to create a design, try it out with users (perhaps comparing it to other designs), make changes, and gather more user feedback. Our desire to abandon the waterfall model and opt for iterative design fortunately followed similar efforts in other areas of the company, so we had concrete examples of its benefits and feasibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Iterative Design in Practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 outlines the process that we used. The process was typical of most products designed iteratively: paper or computer-based prototypes were used to try out design ideas and to gather usability data in the lab. Once a design had been coded, it was refined in the usability lab. When enough of the product had been coded and refined, it was examined more broadly, over time, in the field. Minor usability problems identified in the field were fixed before shipping the product. More importantly, the data gathered in the field is being used to guide work on the next version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our iterative design process was divided into three major phases: exploration, rapid prototyping, and fine tuning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-shortcode=&quot;caption&quot; id=&quot;attachment_6848&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;6848&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://socket3.wordpress.com/2018/02/03/designing-windows-95s-user-interface/win95uidesgn-1/#main&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://socket3.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/win95uidesgn-1.gif?w=620&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;320,81&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;win95uidesgn-1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://socket3.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/win95uidesgn-1.gif?w=620?w=300&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://socket3.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/win95uidesgn-1.gif?w=620?w=320&quot; class=&quot; size-full wp-image-6848 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://socket3.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/win95uidesgn-1.gif?w=620&quot; alt=&quot;win95uidesgn-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Figure 1: Windows 95 iterative design process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Exploration Phase&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this first phase we experimented with design directions and gathered initial user data. We began with a solid foundation for the visual design of the user interface by leveraging work done by the “Cairo” team. We inherited from them much of the fundamental UI and interaction design (the desktop, the “Tray”, context menus, three-dimensional look and feel, etc.). We also collected data from product support about users’ top twenty problems with Windows 3.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 shows a prototype Windows 95 desktop design that we usability tested in January 1993. This design was based on Cairo and incorporated a first pass at fixing some of the known problems with Windows 3.1 (window management in particular).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top icon, File Cabinet, showed a Windows 3.1 File Manager-type view (left pane shows hierarchy, right pane show contents). The second icon, World, showed items on the network. The third icon, Programs, was a folder which contained other folders full of links to programs on the computer. Along the bottom was the “Tray”, which featured three buttons (System, Find, and Help) and a file storage area. Another icon, Wastebasket, was a container for deleted files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usability studies of the prototype desktop were conducted in the Microsoft usability lab, as were later tests. We conducted typical iterative usability studies. Three to four users representing each distinct group of interest (typically beginning and intermediate Windows 3.1 users) completed tasks which exercised the prototype. Questions we addressed in testing were sometimes very broad (e.g., “Do users like it?”) and sometimes very specific (e.g., “After ten minutes of use, do users discover drag and drop to copy a file?”). We collected data typical for iterative studies: verbal protocols, time per task, number of errors, types of errors, and rating information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our usability testing of this prototype revealed much including several surprises:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beginning users and many intermediates were confused by the two-pane view of File Cabinet. (See Figure 3.) They were unsure of the relationship between the panes and how to navigate between folders. Beginners were often overwhelmed by the visual complexity of the File Cabinet and had more basic problems, such as not understanding how folders could exist inside of other folders. Many users were also confused by the Parent Folder icon. It appeared in every folder and looked like a file, yet was really a navigation control for moving up the hierarchy one level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div data-shortcode=&quot;caption&quot; id=&quot;attachment_6850&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;6850&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://socket3.wordpress.com/2018/02/03/designing-windows-95s-user-interface/win95uidesgn-3/#main&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://socket3.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/win95uidesgn-3.gif?w=620&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;412,189&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;win95uidesgn-3&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://socket3.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/win95uidesgn-3.gif?w=620?w=300&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://socket3.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/win95uidesgn-3.gif?w=620?w=412&quot; class=&quot; size-full wp-image-6850 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://socket3.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/win95uidesgn-3.gif?w=620&quot; alt=&quot;win95uidesgn-3&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Figure 3: File Cabinet, an early file system viewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Users of every type were confused by the Programs folder. We thought that having a folder on the desktop with other folders and links to programs inside it would be a natural transition for Windows 3.1 users accustomed to Program Manager, while being relatively easy to learn for beginners. We were wrong! Beginners quickly got lost in all of the folders (unlike File Cabinet, each folder opened into a different window) and other users had a lot of trouble deciding whether they were looking at the actual file system and its files or just links to actual files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users had considerable difficulty deciding what each of the three buttons on the Tray was for and later had trouble remembering where to go for a particular command because their functions overlapped in certain contexts (e.g., to find something in Help, do you go to Find or to Help?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparison to Windows 3.1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the first lab studies it became clear that we needed a baseline with Windows 3.1, to better understand what problems existed prior to Windows 95 and what problems were unique to the new design. First, we gathered market research data about Windows 3.1 users’ twenty most-frequent tasks. We then conducted several lab studies comparing Windows 3.1 and Windows 95, focusing on the top twenty tasks derived from the market research data. We also interviewed professional Windows 3.1 (and Macintosh, for comparison) educators, to learn what they found easy and difficult to teach about the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key findings were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In Windows 3.1, beginning users took over 9 ½ minutes, on average, to locate and open a program that was not immediately visible. Results were not much better for our Windows 95 prototype. These results were clearly unacceptable, given that our market research data (and common sense) told us that starting a program was users’ number one task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beginning users and some intermediates had a lot of trouble using the mouse, especially double-clicking. As a result, they often failed to find things in containers when the only way to open them was double-clicking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beginning users and many intermediates relied almost exclusively on visible cues for finding commands. They relied on (and found intuitive) menu bars and tool bars, but did not use pop-up (or “context”) menus, even after training.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All but the most advanced users did not understand how to manage overlapping windows efficiently. Beginners had the most trouble-when they minimized a window, they considered it “gone” if it was obscured by another window. We heard many stories from educators (and witnessed in the lab) how users caused the computer to run out of RAM by starting multiple copies of a program instead of switching back to the first copy. Intermediate users were more proficient but still had trouble, especially with Multiple-Document-Interface (MDI) applications such as Program Manager and Microsoft Word. Market research data confirmed the problem by revealing that 40% of intermediate Windows users didn’t run more than one program at a time because they had some kind of trouble with the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beginning users were bewildered by the hierarchical file system. Intermediate users could get around in the hierarchy, but often just barely, and usually saved all of their documents in the default directory for the program they were using. This problem (especially the novice case) was also observed with Macintosh users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Change of Direction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results from these studies and interviews greatly changed the design of the Windows 95 UI. In the early Windows 95 prototype, we had purposefully changed some things from Windows 3.1 (e.g., the desktop was now a real container) but not others (e.g., File Manager and Program Manager-like icons on desktop) because we were afraid of going too far with the design. We were aware that creating a product which was radically different from Windows 3.1 could confuse and disappoint millions of existing users, which would clearly be unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the data we collected with the Windows 95 prototype and with Windows 3.1 showed us that we couldn’t continue down the current path. The results with beginning users on basic tasks were unacceptably poor and many intermediate users thought that Windows 95 was just different, not better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to step back and take a few days to think about the situation. The design team held an offsite retreat and reviewed all the data collected to date: baseline usability studies, interviews, market research, and product support information. As we discussed the data, we realized that we needed to focus on users’ most-frequent tasks. We also realized that we had been focusing too much on consistency with Windows 3.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, we realized that a viable solution might not look or act like Windows 3.1 but would definitely provide enough value to be attractive for users of all levels, for potentially different reasons. We realized that a truly usable system would &lt;em&gt;scale&lt;/em&gt; to the needs of different users: it would be easy to discover and learn yet would provide efficiency (through shortcuts and alternate methods) for more-experienced users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Rapid Iteration Phase&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we started working on new designs, we hoped to avoid the classic “easy to learn but hard to use” paradox by always keeping in mind that the basic features of the UI must scale. To achieve this goal, we knew we needed to try many different ideas quickly, compare them, and iterate those which seemed most promising. To do this, we needed to make our design and evaluation processes very efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UI Specification Process Evolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we had opted for an iterative design approach from the beginning, one legacy of the waterfall design approach remained: the monolithic design specification (“spec”). During the first few months of the project, the spec had grown by leaps and bounds and reflected hundreds of person-hours of effort. However, due to the problems we found via user testing, the design documented in the spec was suddenly out of date. The team faced a major decision: spend weeks changing the spec to reflect the new ideas and lose valuable time for iterating or stop updating the spec and let the prototypes and code serve as a “living” spec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some debate, the team decided to take the latter approach. While this change made it somewhat more difficult for outside groups to keep track of what we were doing, it allowed us to iterate at top speed. The change also had an unexpected effect: it brought the whole team closer together because much of the spec existed in conversations and on white boards in people’s offices. Many “hallway” conversations ensued and continued for the duration of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure that interested parties stayed informed about the design, we:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Held regular staff meetings for the design team&lt;/u&gt;. These weekly (sometimes more often) meetings allowed each of us to check in about what we were doing and to efficiently discuss how what one person was working on affected other work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Broadcasted usability test schedules and results via electronic mail&lt;/u&gt;. Design team members received regular notification of upcoming usability tests and results from completed tests so they could more easily keep abreast of the usability information and how the design was evolving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Formally tracked usability issues&lt;/u&gt;. With a project the size of Windows 95, we knew we needed a standard way to note all of the usability issues identified, record when and how they were to be fixed, and then close them once the fix was implemented and tested successfully with users. This process is discussed more in the “Keeping Track of Open Issues” section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Held regular design presentations for outside groups&lt;/u&gt;. As the project progressed, more and more groups (inside and outside Microsoft) wanted to know what we were doing, so we showed them and demonstrated what we were working on. These presentations were more effective than a written document, because the presentations were easier to keep up-to-date and allowed timely design discussions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Separate UI for Beginners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first major design direction we investigated was a separate UI (“shell”) for beginning users. The design was quickly mocked up in Visual Basic and tested in the usability lab. (See Figure 4.) While the design tested well, because it successfully constrained user actions to a very small set, we quickly began to see the limitations as more users were tested:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If just one function a user needed was not supported in the beginner shell, s/he would have to abandon it (at least temporarily).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assuming that most users would gain experience and want to leave the beginner shell eventually, the learning they had done would not necessarily transfer well to the standard shell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The beginner shell was not at all like the programs users would run (word processors, spreadsheets, etc.). As a result, users had to learn two ways of interacting with the computer, which was confusing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div data-shortcode=&quot;caption&quot; id=&quot;attachment_6851&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;6851&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://socket3.wordpress.com/2018/02/03/designing-windows-95s-user-interface/win95uidesgn-4/#main&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://socket3.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/win95uidesgn-4.gif?w=620&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;640,252&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;win95uidesgn-4&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://socket3.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/win95uidesgn-4.gif?w=620?w=300&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://socket3.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/win95uidesgn-4.gif?w=620?w=620&quot; class=&quot; size-full wp-image-6851 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://socket3.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/win95uidesgn-4.gif?w=620&quot; alt=&quot;win95uidesgn-4&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Figure 4: Partial view of separate shell for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons and others, we abandoned the idea. Importantly, because we used a prototyping tool and tested immediately in the usability lab, we still had plenty of time to investigate other directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid Iteration Examples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are overviews of five areas where we designed and tested three or more major design iterations. There are many more areas for which there is not adequate space to discuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Launching Programs: Start Menu&lt;/u&gt;. Although we abandoned the idea of a separate shell for beginners, we salvaged its most useful features: single-click access, high visibility, and menu-based interaction. We mocked up a number of representations in Visual Basic and tested them with users of all experience levels, not just beginners, because we knew that the design solution would need to work well for users of varying experience levels. Figure 5 shows the final Start Menu, with the Programs sub-menu open. The final Start Menu integrated functions other than starting programs, to give users a single-button home base in the UI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div data-shortcode=&quot;caption&quot; id=&quot;attachment_6852&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;6852&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://socket3.wordpress.com/2018/02/03/designing-windows-95s-user-interface/win95uidesgn-5/#main&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://socket3.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/win95uidesgn-5.gif?w=620&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;280,248&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;win95uidesgn-5&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://socket3.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/win95uidesgn-5.gif?w=620?w=280&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://socket3.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/win95uidesgn-5.gif?w=620?w=280&quot; class=&quot; size-full wp-image-6852 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://socket3.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/win95uidesgn-5.gif?w=620&quot; alt=&quot;win95uidesgn-5&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Figure 5: Start menu with Programs item open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;u&gt;Managing Windows: Task Bar&lt;/u&gt;. Our first design idea for making window management easier was not very ambitious, but we weren’t sure how much work was needed to solve the problem. The first design was to change the look of minimized windows from icons to “plates”. (See Figure 6.) We hoped that the problem would be solved by giving minimized windows a distinctive look and by making them larger. We were wrong! Users had almost exactly the same amount of trouble as with Windows 3.1. Our testing data told us that the main problem was windows not being visible at all times, so users couldn’t see what they had open or access tasks quickly. This realization led us fairly quickly to the task bar design, shown in Figure 7. Every task has its own entry in the task bar and the bar stays on top of other windows. User testing confirmed that this was a feasible solution to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;u&gt;Working with Files: “Open” and “Save As” dialogs&lt;/u&gt;. Information from product support plus lab testing told us that beginners and intermediates had a lot of trouble using the system-provided dialogs for opening and saving files. (See Figure 8.) The problems stemmed from the fields in the dialog not being in a logical order and having a complex selection methodology. The Cairo team took the lead on this problem and constructed a comprehensive Visual Basic prototype that included a mock file system. We tested many variations until we arrived at the final design shown in Figure 9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;span&gt;Printing:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;u&gt;Setup Wizard&lt;/u&gt;. Product support information told us that printer setup and configuration was the number one call-generator in Windows 3.1. Many of the problems stemmed from the printer setup UI. (See Figure 10.) Searching for a printer was difficult because all printers were in one long list. Choosing a port for the printer, especially in a networked environment, required tunneling down 4-5 levels and featured non-standard and complicated selection behavior. About the time we started work on this problem, members of the design team began investigating wizards as a solution to multi-step, infrequent tasks. Printer setup fit this definition nicely and the resulting wizard tested very well with users. The printer selection screen from the final wizard is shown in Figure 11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;span&gt;Getting&lt;/span&gt; &lt;u&gt;Help: Search dialog/Index tab&lt;/u&gt;. Lab testing of Windows 3.1 showed that users had trouble with the Search dialog in Help. (See Figure 12.) Users had difficulty understanding that the dialog was essentially two parts and that they needed to choose something from the first list and then from the second list, using different buttons. We tried several ideas before arriving at the final Index tab. (See Figure 13.) The Index tab only has one list, and keywords with more than one topic generate a pop-up dialog that users have no trouble noticing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fine Tuning Phase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we had designed all of the major areas of the product, we realized that we had to take a step back and see how all of the pieces fit together. To accomplish this, we conducted summative lab tests and a longitudinal field study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Summative lab testing&lt;/u&gt;. Using the top twenty tasks identified from market research, we conducted holistic tests of the entire UI. Users of different experience levels completed isomorphic sets of tasks, to measure ease of learning and ease of use once learned. We compared performance with Windows 3.1 as a baseline. After piloting the test in-house to work out problems with the procedure, the test was conducted by an outside vendor, so that the results could be used in a white paper [3]. The results were very encouraging-users finished the tasks in about half the time it took them in Windows 3.1 and they were more satisfied with Windows 95 in 20 of the 21 categories surveyed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Longitudinal field study&lt;/u&gt;. Using the final beta of Windows 95, we conducted a 20-person field study. We first examined how users worked with Windows 3.1 then watched them set up Windows 95. We returned after a week and after a month to measure learning and changes in use over time. We did not find any major usability holes in the product but did tweak wording in the UI and in Help topics. Some of the data collected is being used by product planners for the next version of Windows and also by product support, as a concise list of things to watch out for when taking support calls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Keeping Track of Open Issues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the course of designing and testing the Windows 95 UI, we applied various usability engineering principles and practices [2] [4]. With a project the size of Windows 95, we knew we needed a standard way to note all of the usability issues identified, record when and how they were to be fixed, and then close them once the fix was implemented and tested successfully with users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We designed a relational database to meet this need. (See Figure 14.) After every phase of lab testing, I entered new problems as well as positive findings and assigned them to the appropriate owners-usually a designer and a user education person together. The status of existing problems was also updated-either left open if more work was needed or closed if solved. Every couple of weeks I ran a series of reports that printed all of the remaining problems, by owner, and distributed them to the team members. (See Figure 15.) We met to discuss progress on solutions and when the changed designs would be ready to test with users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any project, the “proof is in the pudding” so sharing some summary statistics is in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lab Testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted sixty-four phases of lab testing, using 560 subjects. Fifty percent of the users were intermediate Windows 3.1 users; the rest were beginners, advanced users, and users of other operating systems. These numbers do not include testing done on components delivered to us by other teams (Exchange email client, fax software, etc.) Testing on those components accounts for approximately 25 phases and 175 users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem Identification&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the core shell components, 699 different “usability statements” were entered into the database during the project. Of that number, 148 were positive findings and 551 were problems. The problems were rated with one of three levels of severity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Level 1: Users were unable to continue with a task or series of tasks due to the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Level 2: Users had considerable difficulty completing a task or series of tasks but were eventually able to continue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Level 3: Users had minor difficulty completing a task or series of tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 551 problems identified, 15% were judged to be level 1, 43% level 2, and 42% level 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem Resolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the project, there were five types of resolution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Addressed. The team fixed the problem and it tested successfully with users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planned. The team designed a fix for the problem and we are waiting for it to be implemented.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Undecided. The team is not sure whether to fix the problem or is unsure if a fix is feasible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Somewhat. The team designed a fix and it was tested with users, and the results were satisfactory but some issues remain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not Addressed. The team is not going to fix the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of the project, all problems with resolution “planned” or “undecided” had migrated to one of the other categories. Eighty-one percent of the problems were resolved “Addressed”, 8% were resolved “Somewhat”, and 11% were resolved “Not Addressed”. Most of the issues that were not addressed were due to a technical limitation, or sometimes a scheduling limitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Windows 95 project was the first experience for many of the team members for doing iterative design, usability testing, and problem tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iterative Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best testament to our belief in iterative design is that literally no detail of the initial UI design for Windows 95 survived unchanged in the final product. At the beginning of the design process, we didn’t envision the scope and volume of changes that we ended up making. Iterative design, using prototypes and the product as the spec, and our constant testing with users allowed us to explore many different solutions to problems quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design team became so used to iterating on a design that we felt rushed when, near the end of the project, we had to do some last-minute design work. There wasn’t sufficient time to iterate more than once. We were disappointed that we didn’t have time to continue fine tuning and re-testing the design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specification Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “prototype or code are the spec” approach overall worked well, although we naturally have refined the process over time. For example, all the prototypes for a given release of the product now reside in a common location on the network and include instructions for installing and running them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design team continues to write initial specification documents and circulate them for early feedback. Once prototyping and usability testing has begun, however, the spec often refers readers to the prototype for details. We have essentially found that the prototype is a richer type of specification, for less work, since it has other uses (usability testing, demos, etc.). A prototype also invites richer feedback, because the reviewer has to imagine less about how the system would work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usability Testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although doing design and user testing iteratively allowed us to create usable task areas or features of the product, user testing the product holistically was key to polishing the fit between the pieces. As discussed previously, we made changes to wording in the UI and in Help topics based on the data collected. If we had not done this testing, users’ overall experience with the product would have been less productive and enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem Tracking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high fix rate for usability problems would not have been possible without the intense dedication of all the team members. The tracking database made the whole process more manageable and ensured that issues didn’t slip between the cracks. However, the fixes would not have been made if the team had not believed in making the most-usable product possible. Key to this belief was our understanding that we probably weren’t going to get it right the first time and that &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; getting it right was as useful and interesting to creating a product as getting it right was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the tracking database, all of the issues marked “Somewhat” or “Not Addressed” were rolled over into a new database, as a starting point for design work on the next version of Windows. Product planners and designers worked with the information on a daily basis, as well as processing reports from product support.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Python’s Weak Performance Matters</title>
<link>https://metarabbit.wordpress.com/2018/02/05/pythons-weak-performance-matters/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://metarabbit.wordpress.com/2018/02/05/pythons-weak-performance-matters/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Here is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2018-January/048819.html&quot;&gt;argument I used to make&lt;/a&gt;, but now disagree with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to add another perspective, I find many “performance” problems in&lt;br/&gt;the real world can often be attributed to factors other than the raw&lt;br/&gt;speed of the CPython interpreter. Yes, I’d love it if the interpreter&lt;br/&gt;were faster, but in my experience a lot of other things dominate. At&lt;br/&gt;least they do provide low hanging fruit to attack first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s something else that’s very important to consider, which&lt;br/&gt;rarely comes up in these discussions, and that’s the developer’s&lt;br/&gt;productivity and programming experience.[…]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is often undervalued, but shouldn’t be! Moore’s Law doesn’t apply&lt;br/&gt;to humans, and you can’t effectively or cost efficiently scale up by&lt;br/&gt;throwing more bodies at a project. Python is one of the best languages&lt;br/&gt;(and ecosystems!) that make the development experience fun, high&lt;br/&gt;quality, and very efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(from Barry Warsaw)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to make this argument. Some of it is just a form of &lt;a href=&quot;https://metarabbit.wordpress.com/2017/02/06/utilitarian-scientific-software-development/&quot;&gt;utilitarian programming&lt;/a&gt;: having a program that runs 1 minute faster but takes 50 extra hours to write is not worth it unless you run it &amp;gt;3000 times. For code that is written as part of data analysis, this is rarely the case. Now I think it is not as strong of an argument as I previously thought. Now I believe that the fact that CPython (the only widely used Python interpreter) is slow is a major disadvantage of the language and not just a small tradeoff for faster development time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What changed in my reasoning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I’m working on other problems. Whereas I used to do a lot of work that was very easy to map to numpy operations (which are fast as they use compiled code), now I write a lot of code which is not straight numerics. And, then, if I have to write it in standard Python, it is slow as molasses. I don’t mean slower in the sense of “wait a couple of seconds”, I mean “wait several hours instead of 2 minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, data keeps getting bigger and computers come with more and more cores (which Python cannot easily take advantage of), while single-core performance is only slowly getting better. Thus, Python is a worse and worse solution, performance-wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other languages have also demonstrated that it is possible to get good performance with high-level code (using JIT or very aggressive compile-time optimizations). Looking from afar, the core Python development group seems uninterested in these ideas. They regularly pop-up in side projects: psyco, unladen swallow, stackless, shedskin, and pypy; the last one being the only one that is in active development; however, for all the buzz they generate they never make into CPython, which is still using the same basic bytecode stack-machine strategy that it used 20 years ago. Yes, optimizing a very dynamic language it’s not a trivial problem, but Javascript is at least as dynamic as Python is and it has several JIT-based implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that programmer time is more valuable than computer time, but waiting for results to finish computing is also a waste of my time (I suppose I could do something else in the meanwhile, but context switches are such a killer of my performance that I often just wait).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also sometimes found that, in order to make something fast in Python, I end up with complex code, almost unreadable, code. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.embl.de/costea/metaSNV/blob/master/metaSNV_post.py#L331&quot;&gt;this function&lt;/a&gt; for an example. The first time we wrote it, it was a loop based function, directly translating the formula it is computing. It took hours on a medium sized problem (it would take weeks on the real-life problems we want to tackle!). Now, it’s down to a few seconds, but unless you are much smarter than me, it’s not trivial to read out the underlying formula from the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is that I find myself doing &lt;a href=&quot;https://metarabbit.wordpress.com/2017/05/02/i-tried-haskell-for-5-years-and-heres-how-it-was/&quot;&gt;more and more things in Haskell&lt;/a&gt;, which lets me write high-level code with decent performance (still slower than what I get if I go all the way down to C++, but with very good libraries). I still use &lt;a href=&quot;http://jug.readthedocs.io/&quot;&gt;Jug&lt;/a&gt; (Python-based) to glue it all together, but it is calling Haskell code to do all the actual work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now sometimes prototype in Python, then do a kind of race: I start running the analysis on the main dataset, while at the same time reimplementing the whole thing in Haskell. Then, I start the Haskell version and try to make it finish before the Python-analysis completes. Many times, the Haskell version wins (even counting development time!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Here is a “fun” Python performance bug that I ran into the other day: deleting a set of 1 billion strings takes &amp;gt;12 hours. Obviously, this particular instance can be fixed, but this exactly the sort of thing that I would never have done a few years ago. A billion strings seemed like a lot back then, but now we regularly discuss multiple Terabytes of input data as “not a big deal”. &lt;em&gt;This may not apply for your settings, but it does for mine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2&lt;/strong&gt;: Based on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16322728&quot;&gt;comment I made on hackernews&lt;/a&gt;, this is how I summarize my views:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main motivation is to minimize total time, which is is &lt;em&gt;TimeToWriteCode&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;TimeToRunCode&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python has the lowest &lt;em&gt;TimeToWriteCode&lt;/em&gt;, but very high &lt;em&gt;TimeToRunCode&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;TimeToWriteCode&lt;/em&gt; is fixed as it is a human factor (after the initial learning curve, I am not getting that much smarter). However, as datasets grow and single-core performance does not get better &lt;em&gt;TimeToRunCode&lt;/em&gt; keeps increasing, so that it is more and more worth it to spend more time writing code to decrease &lt;em&gt;TimeToRunCode&lt;/em&gt;. C++ would give me the lowest &lt;em&gt;TimeToRunCode&lt;/em&gt;, but at too high a cost in&lt;em&gt; TimeToWriteCode&lt;/em&gt; (not so much the language, as the lack of decent libraries and package management). Haskell is (for me) a good tradeoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;reply&quot;&gt;This is applicable to my work, where we do use large datasets as inputs. YMMV.&lt;/div&gt;

<title>A Developer’s Guide to Responding to National Security Letters</title>
<link>https://www.twilio.com/blog/2018/02/developers-guide-to-nsl.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.twilio.com/blog/2018/02/developers-guide-to-nsl.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-12&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When the FBI Shows Up at Your Office with an NSL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you receive thousands of requests from law enforcement each year, it’s actually not a surprise when a representative from the FBI shows up at your office to deliver a request for information. There are no cloaks or daggers involved, just a sealed manila envelope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco FBI office is very familiar with working with tech companies and will reach out with a call or email to find a time to stop by.  If parking is bad – like it often can be around the Twilio office – the FBI representative might even be willing to hand you the request right on the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So receiving government requests for information can be a fairly administrative, straightforward process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as we outlined in a blog post in July, National Security Letters are unusual for requests because they’re steeped in secrecy.  That’s because the US Department of Justice is able to issue such requests without the oversight of a court, and these requests contain strict nondisclosure requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means companies – including Twilio – haven’t been able to notify users when they received National Security Letters, or even include the specific number of these requests they’ve received in transparency reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies – including Twilio – have begun requesting judicial review to see whether the nondisclosure requirement of National Security Letters they have received is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, after review, the Department of Justice will drop the nondisclosure requirement and permit companies to notify their users, restate the range of National Security Letters received in their transparency reporting, and publish the National Security Letters and the letters from the DOJ that allow the company to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what happened with Twilio and the two &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/legal/transparency/nsl&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.twilio.com/legal/transparency/nsl', 'National Security Letters');&quot;&gt;National Security Letters&lt;/a&gt; we posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note that the information we redacted was either requested by the DOJ or to protect the potentially personally identifiable information of the Twilio customer(s).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Practices in Responding to National Security Letters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Twilio receives a National Security Letter, we have a checklist that we’re happy to share with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verify the request is a real legal request.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We verify that it’s an actual representative of the FBI (yes there’s a cool badge). And we verify the request is actually addressed to Twilio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review the info being sought and any restrictions included in the request. / Determine whether you will try to narrow the scope.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We check to make sure it’s information we actually have, and determine whether we will seek to narrow the scope of the information requested.&lt;br/&gt;As we cover in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/08/government-requests.html&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/08/government-requests.html', 'July 2017 Best Practices for Responding to Government Requests for Information');&quot;&gt;July 2017 Best Practices for Responding to Government Requests for Information&lt;/a&gt; post, there’s a reason agencies ask for a wide range of information as a default, and companies can push back on that default request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue an initial objection response that requests review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We confirm receipt and indicate our objection to the nondisclosure requirement and requesting judicial review.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kj6lfk-YyIYyqiZAIfYkKnGhGBQvYe8ZvypK0b2TUEg/edit?usp=sharing&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kj6lfk-YyIYyqiZAIfYkKnGhGBQvYe8ZvypK0b2TUEg/edit?usp=sharing', 'Here’s a template for requesting judicial review that you can adapt for your own use');&quot;&gt;Here’s a template for requesting judicial review that you can adapt for your own use&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to Twilio following the process above and issuing a request for judicial review, the Department of Justice withdrew their nondisclosure requirements on the two National Security Letters we’ve published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the responses, in the National Security Letter dated May 24, 2017, Twilio was directed to provide the information requested but permitted to notify our customer, which we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the National Security Letter dated May 19, 2017, the US Department of Justice withdrew the request entirely rather than proceed with judicial review. Because Twilio did not furnish a response to the information requested, we did not notify our specific customer(s) of the existence of the request. However, for the sake of furthering the public discourse on National Security Letters, we are publishing a copy of the request and the response authorizing us to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when we received responses from the DOJ to our request for judicial review following the template linked above, we added new items to our checklist in relation to replying to the request with the requested information and notifying the customer(s) that we did so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respond to the agent with the information requested&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;We furnish our formal response with the information requested and notify the agent that we intend to notify the customer, citing the document we received waving the nondislcosure requirement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notify customer(s)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;We notify our customer that we have received and will respond to a request for information.&lt;br/&gt;Twilio’s commitment to notify customers that we have responded to a request for information, when not prohibited from doing so by law, is in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/legal/privacy&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.twilio.com/legal/privacy', 'Privacy Policy');&quot;&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restate Transparency Reports.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We update the relevant Transparency Report to revise the number range of National Security Letters received.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publish properly redacted copies of the NSL and the DOJ response permitting disclosure&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;We publish copies of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/legal/transparency/nsl&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.twilio.com/legal/transparency/nsl', 'National Security Letters');&quot;&gt;National Security Letters&lt;/a&gt; on our website redacting personal information about the requesting agent per the DOJ’s guidelines and customer-identifying information.If Twilio has received additional National Security Letters and if Twilio obtains permission to confirm receipt of such requests, we pledge to publish these letters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ongoing Privacy and Free Speech Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adopting a process for dropping nondisclosure requirements is an important step toward transparency, accountability and oversight, and we commend the Department of Justice for instituting this practice and encourage the continued review of this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s still a long way to go for full oversight and accountability. Twilio and other companies are still prevented from disclosing the specific number of National Security Letters received, and Twilio continues to object to blanket nondisclosure requirements. Twilio believes that government requests should not be issued in secret, and should only be issued with the proper transparency, accountability and oversight that judicial review provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process for receiving and responding to National Security Letters has become less opaque, but there’s still more room for sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that spirit of openness, for questions or comments please reach us at: transparency@twilio.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please note that these best practices do not constitute legal advice. You should consult an attorney if you have any questions in how to respond to requests for information from government agencies. For example, even with the nondisclosure requirement, National Security Letters expressly permit the recipient to consult “an attorney to obtain legal advice or legal assistance with respect to this letter.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you remember when everyone thought the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/5511678/apple-ipad-review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/5511678/apple-ipad-review', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;arrival of the iPad&lt;/a&gt; heralded the demise of E Ink-based devices? Even yours truly far prefers the experience of reading books on the bright, full-color LCD display of the iPad Mini. Consequently I’ve spent a lot of time questioning the need for e-ink devices like Amazon Kindle or anything created by E Ink, the primary producer or e-ink displays. But at CES last month I had an abrupt change of heart. It was there I was able to try out the reMarkable tablet for the first time, and after playing with it for a few minutes, I was excited at the thought of finally being able to go completely paperless; no more notebooks, no more misplaced scraps of paper, and no more sticky notes. I immediately begged them to loan me a unit to review, and after nearly two weeks with it I’m still in love—even if I know this thing has big problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;reviewbox-inset align--left&quot;&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;review-box&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;storytype-label-wrapper storytype-label-wrapper--small-margin storytype-label-wrapper--top&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;storytype-label storytype-label--outlined&quot; href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/c/review/e-readers&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Permalink meta', 'Review category click', 'gizmodo.com\/c\/review\/e-readers');&quot;&gt;E-Readers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;storytype-label storytype-label--outlined&quot; href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/c/review/e-readers/remarkable&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Permalink meta', 'Review subcategory click', 'gizmodo.com\/c\/review\/e-readers\/remarkable');&quot;&gt;reMarkable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;review-box__content&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;review-box__data-item&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;review-box__data-label&quot;&gt;What is it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;review-box__data-value&quot;&gt;An E Ink tablet that's more fun to write on than paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;review-box__data-item&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;review-box__data-label&quot;&gt;Price&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;review-box__data-value&quot;&gt;$600&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;review-box__data-item&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;review-box__data-label&quot;&gt;Like&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;review-box__data-value&quot;&gt;The smooth feel of the stylus moving across the E Ink display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;review-box__data-item&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;review-box__data-label&quot;&gt;No Like&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;review-box__data-value&quot;&gt;That price, and some frustrating software choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same e-ink technology used by devices like the Kindle to authentically emulate the &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; of paper can now be used to emulate the &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; of paper. The reMarkable tablet combines an E Ink display and Wacom’s much loved stylus technology to create a device that can replace all of your notebooks—if you can live with some software shortcomings, and an insane price tag. This thing costs $600—which is more than any iPad, and just $50 cheaper than an iPad Pro. So how can a tablet with limited applications and a grayscale display be worth that price?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me it’s because the reMarkable tablet’s writing surface is a night and day experience to writing on the smooth glass of an iPad. Its E Ink display is protected by a layer of finely textured acrylic glass that’s not only durable and scratch proof, it also feels like paper as you scribble away with its battery-free stylus. The experience is as close as I’ve ever come to digitally replicating paper, and after spending a lot more time with the tablet, it’s already replaced most of the pens and paper on my desk. The iPad might have failed to kill off e-ink devices, but the reMarkable tablet definitely has the potential to make paper notebooks obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the right circumstances, the pen on paper feel of the reMarkable tablet is absolutely perfect. When doodling, sketching, or writing in cursive, there is no noticeable lag between your physical pen strokes and what appears on screen. Unfortunately, I can barely remember how to write in cursive, and I’ve found that my preferred style of all-caps printing penmanship (if you can even call it that) seems to tax the reMarkable tablet’s 1GHz ARM A9 processor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrapper lazy-image lazy-gif&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-permalink-sub-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; class=&quot;lazyload ls-pre-lazy-img show-for-medium-up&quot; data-frozen-src=&quot;https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--J0nkfji3--/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/k8swsvkgwwpkr0usd7ew.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; class=&quot;lazyload ls-lazy-image-tag ls-gif&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-poster-src=&quot;https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--J0nkfji3--/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/k8swsvkgwwpkr0usd7ew.jpg&quot; data-anim-src=&quot;https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--XMbjs6Ws--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_320/k8swsvkgwwpkr0usd7ew.gif&quot; data-width=&quot;800&quot; data-chomp-id=&quot;k8swsvkgwwpkr0usd7ew&quot; data-format=&quot;gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GIF&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
The stylus’ lag is only apparent when you’re printing, when writing, scribbling, or sketching, the digital pen on paper experience is flawless.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To facilitate a robust undo feature, the tablet tracks every stroke you make as soon as you lift the stylus off the screen. Writing in cursive, where the letters are all connected, results in long strokes with the stylus only occasionally being lifted. But printing results in countless tiny strokes for each letter, and as the reMarkable tablet works to log them all, it results in a tiny bit of lag that unfortunately takes away from an otherwise magnificent writing experience. Hopefully this can be improved through software updates, or a faster processor on future versions of the tablet, so that I can keep on printing like a grade schooler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrapper lazy-image&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-permalink-sub-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; class=&quot;lazyload ls-lazy-image-tag&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-width=&quot;2000&quot; data-chomp-id=&quot;fr4j5vp5ulluurqvvq7y&quot; data-format=&quot;jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
An on-screen keyboard works well enough, but handwriting recognition would be a welcome addition to the tablet’s feature-set.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit js_ad-unit hide-contents ad-mobile js_ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That 1GHz processor (which is slower than the one the Kindle Oasis uses) and just 512Mb of RAM also results in boot-up times of about 15 seconds, the occasional sluggishness when loading larger files, and some unfortunately long waits when zooming in and out of a page full of notes and illustrations. There’s no doubt a faster processor would vastly improve this tablet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the big problem with the reMarkable tablet isn’t the hardware. It’s the software. There are frustrating gaps in usability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As wonderful as the tablet is to write on, it lacks handwriting recognition. When you’re creating digital notebooks to fill with sketches and notes you will need to use an on-screen keyboard to name them, and then you can’t move pages in and out of notebooks once they’ve been created. These might seem like small problems, but they add up over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit js_ad-unit hide-contents ad-mobile js_ad-mobile&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrapper lazy-image lazy-gif&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-permalink-sub-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; class=&quot;lazyload ls-pre-lazy-img show-for-medium-up&quot; data-frozen-src=&quot;https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--cI3P0V6M--/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/gaepzsgcsxw07bfnrwl0.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; class=&quot;lazyload ls-lazy-image-tag ls-gif&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-poster-src=&quot;https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--cI3P0V6M--/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/gaepzsgcsxw07bfnrwl0.jpg&quot; data-anim-src=&quot;https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--W9pVMNp1--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_320/gaepzsgcsxw07bfnrwl0.gif&quot; data-width=&quot;1000&quot; data-chomp-id=&quot;gaepzsgcsxw07bfnrwl0&quot; data-format=&quot;gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GIF&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
Over time the tip on the reMarkable tablet’s stylus will wear down, but it comes with replacements, including an emergency backup inside the stylus itself.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other software issues are harder to see. The palm-rejection functionality is rock solid, ensuring you never make accidental screen presses while holding the tablet and writing, but it comes at the cost of not being able to flip through documents using finger swipes or taps. You’ll have to rely on the three hardware buttons below the display to navigate the pages of individual documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be a travesty having an e-ink device as large as the reMarkable tablet and not be able to read ebooks, so the Wi-Fi-connected device works alongside a desktop client and a proprietary cloud service to wirelessly transfer PDF and epub files and even back up your own notes and doodles. The setup process is beyond easy (although you’ll need to create yet another online account) and files quickly show up in either the tablet’s pre-existing Documents (PDFs) or Ebooks (epubs) folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit js_ad-unit hide-contents ad-mobile js_ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrapper lazy-image&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-permalink-sub-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; class=&quot;lazyload ls-lazy-image-tag&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-width=&quot;2000&quot; data-chomp-id=&quot;mvnucce6si6wo8q2xjsy&quot; data-format=&quot;jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
You can annotate PDFs and epub files using the stylus, which could be a fantastic feature for students who’ve switched to digital textbooks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disappointingly, ubiquitous image files like JPEGs and text files like DOCX aren’t supported yet, which is unfortunate because the reMarkable tablet also lets you annotate and mark up existing documents. It’s a great feature for editors, or students studying a textbook, but what isn’t great is annotating an epub file and then changing its display font or font size. The text will automatically adjust its flow and move around to fit the screen, but your annotations won’t, leaving them misplaced and out of context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point it certainly sounds like I deeply despise the reMarkable tablet, but that’s far from the truth. Do I wish it had a backlight of some sort so it was usable in a darkened theater during a press conference? Absolutely. Do I wish it could convert handwriting to editable text, if even only through its accompanying desktop software or mobile apps? Of course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit js_ad-unit hide-contents ad-mobile js_ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are also lots of things I really like about the tablet. Its 3,000 mAh battery lasts for days. When creating documents you can choose from a massive list of blank templates, including calendars, to to-do lists, grids, and storyboards. And even with a 10.3-inch screen that’s wonderfully spacious for reading, the tablet feels much lighter than an iPad, thanks to an aluminum back panel that also adds rigidity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A giant list of blank template pages will help keep your notes looking neat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kinja-slide&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 10.3-inches, the reMarkable tablet has considerably more screen real estate than recent versions of the Amazon Kindle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reMarkable tablet’s lock/power button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kinja-slide&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tablet’s grayscale E Ink display limits your pen choices, but you can switch between a pencil, ink pen, marker, and highlighter, and adjust the stroke size. You can even move and rotate portions of the screen using selection boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kinja-slide&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only case currently available for the reMarkable is this felt sleeve for an additional $80.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;footer class=&quot;kinja-slideshow__index&quot;&gt;1 / 5&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;My biggest problem with the reMarkable tablet is that I want all of its supporting functionality to be as excellent as its stylus is, but its software and UI just isn’t. However, the experience of writing on the reMarkable tablet is so fantastic that I’ve already started carrying it every day in lieu of a notebook, despite all the hoops I have to jump through to use the rest of its features. It’s really that good.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit js_ad-unit hide-contents ad-mobile js_ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s harder to accept than those software hiccups is the reMarkable tablet’s $600 price tag. That is incredibly steep for a touchscreen e-reader, even one with stylus support. It’s an expensive way to go paperless, and it will frustrate even those used to using bleeding edge technology. Unless you’re going through reams of notebooks every day you’re better off biding your time for a, hopefully, cheaper second-generation iteration of this tablet. The hardware is for a paperless future is finally here, now the software and price need to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;README&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The pen on paper experience is perfectly recreated here. It’s the first stylus-based device that I can write on as fast as I can on paper, without having to wait for the screen to catch up. Although, certain penmanship styles do result in some frustrating screen lag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit js_ad-unit hide-contents ad-mobile js_ad-mobile&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;At $600 it’s expensive for a tablet with a grayscale screen, no apps, and very limited functionality. There’s just no getting around that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Battery-free Wacom stylus never needs charging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can only import PDF and epub documents, but importing basic image files like JPEGs, or text docs, isn’t supported yet. What?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit js_ad-unit hide-contents ad-mobile js_ad-mobile&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Organizing and reorganizing files on the tablet is limited, with no ability to actually search for content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pages in a document can only be turned using hardware buttons, swipes or screen edge taps won’t work thanks to the palm-rejection functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No backlight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Currently only a single sleeve-style case is available, for an additional $80. A quick-access folio-style case would be more functional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit js_ad-unit hide-contents ad-mobile js_ad-mobile&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<og:title>The reMarkable E Ink Tablet Is Way Too Good For Its Software (and Price)</og:title>

<og:description>Do you remember when everyone thought the arrival of the iPad heralded the demise of E Ink-based devices? Even yours truly far prefers the experience of reading books on the bright, full-color LCD display of the iPad Mini. Consequently I’ve spent a lot of time questioning the need for e-ink devices like Amazon Kindle or anything created by E Ink, the primary producer or e-ink displays. But at CES last month I had an abrupt change of heart. It was there I was able to try out the reMarkable tablet for the first time, and after playing with it for a few minutes, I was excited at the thought of finally being able to go completely paperless; no more notebooks, no more misplaced scraps of paper, and no more sticky notes. I immediately begged them to loan me a unit to review, and after nearly two weeks with it I’m still in love—even if I know this thing has big problems.</og:description>

<title>The outdoor community made water filtration a must for a reason</title>
<link>https://www.outsideonline.com/2279401/actually-slate-you-really-should-filter-your-water</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.outsideonline.com/2279401/actually-slate-you-really-should-filter-your-water</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Last year, a good friend of mine caught chronic giardiasis. The diarrhea that resulted was unpredictable, frequently sending him scrambling for a bathroom. For most of the year, that meant his dating life was totally on hold and he couldn’t travel. Already a thin guy, the resulting weightloss caused him to look visibly ill. To him, the worst part was the embarrassment all this caused, all from a parasite he caught on a camping trip here in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why I want to address a story that ran last week. &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/technology/2018/02/filtering-stream-water-or-fresh-water-is-medically-unnecessary.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Writing in Slate&lt;/a&gt;, Ethan Linck rehashed an eight-year-old study that found that contaminants in backcountry water sources are exceedingly rare. Using that evidence, he argued that you don’t need to clean water on camping trips in the U.S. and Canada. “The idea that most wilderness water sources are inherently unsafe is baseless dogma, unsupported by any epidemiological evidence,” Linck claims. He goes on to suggest that the outdoor recreation industry has pushed sales of water filters in order to sell campers on added complication they don’t need. He says he long ago stopped purifying his own drinking water while camping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wemjournal.org/article/S1080-6032(04)70498-6/fulltext&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The study Linck cites reaches similar conclusions&lt;/a&gt;: “There is no good epidemiologic evidence that North American wilderness waters are inherently unsafe for consumption,” author Thomas R. Welch argues. The study tested a water source in a high-use area in the Sierra Nevada mountains, in central California—the kind of place you’d expect to find contaminants. Researchers found only trace amounts of giardia there: one would have to drink more than seven liters of the water to get sick, they said. In other, less frequently used areas, the study found no harmful bacteria or protozoa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few very obvious problems with all this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;While it's correct that there is little scientific evidence of significant pathogens in wilderness water sources in the U.S. and Canada, there’s also very little scientific study on the subject. The most thorough research cited by Welch appears to have been conducted two decades ago by the editors of &lt;em&gt;Backpacker&lt;/em&gt; magazine. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not all backcountry water sources are created equal. Welch’s work relies on water testing conducted only in a single highly-protected mountain range in a single highly-regulated state— California's Sierra Nevada. Do studies conducted there translate to Minnesota’s Boundary Waters, or Georgia’s Okefenokee Swamp? To suggest that they might is ridiculous. It's also worth noting that pathogen levels are constantly in flux—variables like rainfall, temperature, season, and animal behavior all play a role. The level of pathogens recorded at a single water source will vary month-to-month and year-to-year. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The study makes no account for how different people recreate outdoors and how they define that recreation. “Backcountry” may mean the High Sierra to Linck, Welch, and me, but something else entirely to a Cub Scout troop on the East Coast. As Welch details in his study, water sources adjacent to a sewer outlet have plenty of documented cases of spreading pathogens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linck’s assumption that cleaning backcountry water requires a “$99.95 microfilter pump” is simply wrong. Cheaper, simpler methods can actually be &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; effective, and don’t place a heavy financial or weight penalty on the user. Simple chlorine dioxide tablets will kill any protozoa, bacteria, cyst, or virus you’ll find in North America, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LY89T00/?tag=outsideonlws-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cost around 50 cents a tablet&lt;/a&gt;. Boiling water is free, if you have a stove, and 100 percent effective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The low rates of infection reported by Welch’s study don’t control for whether or not any water purification methods were used by the study group. As Linck argues, virtually every backpacker is using a purification method of some kind, so the reported infection rates are misleading in this context. The low rates of infection reported could actually be a strong argument &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; the use of purification techniques and products. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, those issues create a highly misleading and arguably irresponsible conclusion. There is not sufficient scientific evidence to tell people not to filter their water—only enough to prove that &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; water sources in the Sierra Nevada &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be safe to drink without treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure__inner enlarge&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; data-original=&quot;https://www.outsideonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/img_600x400/public/2018/02/05/cdc-water.jpg?itok=bq6qUU_K&quot; alt=&quot;CDC-Water&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;article__caption&quot;&gt;Here's the CDC's findings on which treatment methods work against which pathogens.&lt;/span&gt; (Center for Disease Control)
&lt;p&gt;The irresponsibility of the don’t-filter argument is exacerbated by two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;While most giardia,  e. coli, cyrptosporideum, and waterborne pathogens induce fairly minor illnesses in adults, the effects can be much more severe if the infected person suffers from immunosuppression, is very young or old, or, as with my friend, is simply unlucky. In children, for instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/giardia/illness.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the CDC says&lt;/a&gt; giardiasis can may lead to symptoms as severe as delayed physical and mental growth, slow development, and malnutrition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effective treatment options are affordable and easy to use. Use an expensive filter because you're short on time or like cleaner tasting water—cheaper methods will keep you just as healthy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Welch and Linck argue that the failure to wash hands after taking a poo is responsible for more infections than drinking unpurified water. But while that is an argument for taking some hand sanitizer along, it is not an argument against water treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time you go camping, you should do both.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Snap Revenue Surges 72% on User Growth, Advertising Gains</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-06/snap-revenue-surges-72-on-user-growth-advertising-gains</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-06/snap-revenue-surges-72-on-user-growth-advertising-gains</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Don’t count &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SNAP:US&quot; title=&quot;Snap leadership&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Snap Inc.&lt;/a&gt; out just yet.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The company delivered sales that blew past analysts’ expectations, its first upbeat quarterly report since going public, as advertisers start to get more comfortable spending money on its Snapchat app. The stock jumped as much as 31 percent in extended trading.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snap’s first year as a public company has been marked by hurdles, including the loss of its heads of product and engineering. Facebook Inc. has copied some of Snapchat’s most popular features for bigger audiences, while a dramatic redesign of the Snapchat app is rolling out slowly. The numbers on Tuesday may help some on Wall Street revisit their original thesis on the company: that Snap, already popular with young people, has enough growth potential to carve out a solid slice of a digital ad market dominated by Facebook and Google.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s been a roller coaster mismatch between expectations and reality, but the benefits of all their initiatives are finally starting to come to fruition,” said James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt &amp;amp; Co.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the middle of 2017, Snap began moving to an automated bidding process for selling ads, making it easier for more marketers to buy spots. By October, the system was mandatory. Though that dented average prices, the hit was offset by new customers and a rising number of ad views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This decision quickly paid off,&quot; Snap Chief Strategy Officer Imran Khan said during a conference call with analysts. &quot;In three months, we more than tripled the number of advertisers spending in our auction.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snap said fourth-quarter sales jumped 72 percent to $285.7 million, beating the $252.8 million average projection of analysts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Snapchat had 187 million daily active users in the fourth quarter, up 18 percent from a year ago and ahead of the 184.3 million analysts &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/P3P0H06JTSE9&quot; title=&quot;PREVIEW SNAP 4Q: Expectations Low Amid App Redesign, Ad Shift&quot; class=&quot;terminal-news-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;chart&quot; data-responsive=&quot;true&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;chart-js&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;chart__title&quot;&gt;Steady Growth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chart__subtitle&quot;&gt;Snap's daily active users is approaching 200 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;chart__source&quot;&gt;Source: Bloomberg&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iAHsOVU3kv6Y/v1/-1x-1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excluding certain items, the Los Angeles-based company reported a loss of 13 cents a share, compared to the 16-cent loss analysts predicted. The net loss was $350 million in the fourth quarter, for a full-year loss of $3.45 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average revenue per user, a closely watched number, rose 46 percent to $1.53 in the final period of 2017, while a similar measure of costs grew much more slowly, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our business really came together towards the end of last year,” Chief Executive Officer Evan Spiegel said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, not everyone on Wall Street is convinced Snap can compete with its larger ad rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I remain skeptical about their revenue potential. While they blew away expectations, those expectations were quite low,&quot; said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. &quot;Snap faces a steep uphill climb to compete for ad dollars.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;h2&gt;Peter Thiel’s data-mining company is using War on Terror tools to track American citizens. The scary thing? Palantir is desperate for new customers.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Peter Waldman, Lizette Chapman, and Jordan Robertson&lt;br/&gt;April 19, 2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sectionbreak&quot;&gt;High above the Hudson River in downtown Jersey City, a former U.S. Secret Service agent named Peter Cavicchia III ran special ops for JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co. His insider threat group—most large financial institutions have one—used computer algorithms to monitor the bank’s employees, ostensibly to protect against perfidious traders and other miscreants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aided by as many as 120 “forward-deployed engineers” from the data mining company Palantir Technologies Inc., which JPMorgan engaged in 2009, Cavicchia’s group vacuumed up emails and browser histories, GPS locations from company-issued smartphones, printer and download activity, and transcripts of digitally recorded phone conversations. Palantir’s software aggregated, searched, sorted, and analyzed these records, surfacing keywords and patterns of behavior that Cavicchia’s team had flagged for potential abuse of corporate assets. Palantir’s algorithm, for example, alerted the insider threat team when an employee started badging into work later than usual, a sign of potential disgruntlement. That would trigger further scrutiny and possibly physical surveillance after hours by bank security personnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;cover&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2018-palantir-peter-thiel/img/cover.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featured in &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg Businessweek&lt;/em&gt;, April 23, 2018. &lt;a href=&quot;https://subscribe.businessweek.com/servlet/OrdersGateway?cds_mag_code=BWK&amp;amp;cds_page_id=221240&amp;amp;source=coverstoryrail&quot;&gt;Subscribe now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, however, Cavicchia himself went rogue. Former JPMorgan colleagues describe the environment as Wall Street meets &lt;em&gt;Apocalypse Now&lt;/em&gt;, with Cavicchia as Colonel Kurtz, ensconced upriver in his office suite eight floors above the rest of the bank’s security team. People in the department were shocked that no one from the bank or Palantir set any real limits. They darkly joked that Cavicchia was listening to their calls, reading their emails, watching them come and go. Some planted fake information in their communications to see if Cavicchia would mention it at meetings, which he did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all ended when the bank’s senior executives learned that they, too, were being watched, and what began as a promising marriage of masters of big data and global finance descended into a spying scandal. The misadventure, which has never been reported, also marked an ominous turn for Palantir, one of the most richly valued startups in Silicon Valley. An intelligence platform designed for the global War on Terror was weaponized against ordinary Americans at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2004 by Peter Thiel and some fellow PayPal alumni, Palantir cut its teeth working for the Pentagon and the CIA in Afghanistan and Iraq. The company’s engineers and products don’t do any spying themselves; they’re more like a spy’s brain, collecting and analyzing information that’s fed in from the hands, eyes, nose, and ears. The software combs through disparate data sources—financial documents, airline reservations, cellphone records, social media postings—and searches for connections that human analysts might miss. It then presents the linkages in colorful, easy-to-interpret graphics that look like spider webs. U.S. spies and special forces loved it immediately; they deployed Palantir to synthesize and sort the blizzard of battlefield intelligence. It helped planners avoid roadside bombs, track insurgents for assassination, even hunt down Osama bin Laden. The military success led to federal contracts on the civilian side. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services uses Palantir to detect Medicare fraud. The FBI uses it in criminal probes. The Department of Homeland Security deploys it to screen air travelers and keep tabs on immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Police and sheriff’s departments in New York, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-02-28/artificial-intelligence-in-policing-advice-for-new-orleans-and-palantir&quot;&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;, Chicago, and Los Angeles have also used it, frequently ensnaring in the digital dragnet people who aren’t suspected of committing any crime. People and objects pop up on the Palantir screen inside boxes connected to other boxes by radiating lines labeled with the relationship: “Colleague of,” “Lives with,” “Operator of [cell number],” “Owner of [vehicle],” “Sibling of,” even “Lover of.” If the authorities have a picture, the rest is easy. Tapping databases of driver’s license and ID photos, law enforcement agencies can now identify more than half the population of U.S. adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was effectively Palantir’s R&amp;amp;D lab and test bed for a foray into the financial sector, via a product called Metropolis. The two companies made an odd couple. Palantir’s software engineers showed up at the bank on skateboards. Neckties and haircuts were too much to ask, but JPMorgan drew the line at T-shirts. The programmers had to agree to wear shirts with collars, tucked in when possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Metropolis was installed and refined, JPMorgan made an equity investment in Palantir and inducted the company into its Hall of Innovation, while its executives raved about Palantir in the press. The software turned “data landfills into gold mines,” Guy Chiarello, who was then JPMorgan’s chief information officer, told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg Businessweek&lt;/em&gt; in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;chart&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The founder of Palantir is extremely well connected. Here’s how his life might appear in the company’s model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;chartDesktop&quot; src=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2018-palantir-peter-thiel/img/chart_desktop.png&quot; alt=&quot;Palantir network&quot;/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;chartMobile&quot; src=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2018-palantir-peter-thiel/img/chart_mobile.png&quot; alt=&quot;Palantir network&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chart: Dorothy Gambrell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cavicchia was in charge of forensic investigations at the bank. Through Palantir, he gained administrative access to a full range of corporate security databases that had previously required separate authorizations and a specific business justification to use. He had unprecedented access to everything, all at once, all the time, on one analytic platform. He was a one-man National Security Agency, surrounded by the Palantir engineers, each one costing the bank as much as $3,000 a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior investigators stumbled onto the full extent of the spying by accident. In May 2013 the bank’s leadership ordered an internal probe into who had leaked a document to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; about a federal investigation of JPMorgan for possibly manipulating U.S. electricity markets. Evidence indicated the leaker could have been Frank Bisignano, who’d recently resigned as JPMorgan’s co-chief operating officer to become CEO of First Data Corp., the big payments processor. Cavicchia had used Metropolis to gain access to emails about the leak investigation—some written by top executives—and the bank believed he shared the contents of those emails and other communications with Bisignano after Bisignano had left the bank. (Inside JPMorgan, Bisignano was considered Cavicchia’s patron—a senior executive who protected and promoted him.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan officials debated whether to file a suspicious activity report with federal regulators about the internal security breach, as required by law whenever banks suspect regulatory violations. They decided not to—a controversial decision internally, according to multiple sources with the bank. Cavicchia negotiated a severance agreement and was forced to resign. He joined Bisignano at First Data, where he’s now a senior vice president. Chiarello also went to First Data, as president. After their departures, JPMorgan drastically curtailed its Palantir use, in part because “it never lived up to its promised potential,” says one JPMorgan executive who insisted on anonymity to discuss the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank, First Data, and Bisignano, Chiarello, and Cavicchia didn’t respond to separately emailed questions for this article. Palantir, in a statement responding to questions about how JPMorgan and others have used its software, declined to answer specific questions. “We are aware that powerful technology can be abused and we spend a lot of time and energy making sure our products are used for the forces of good,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much depends on how the company chooses to define good. In March a former computer engineer for Cambridge Analytica, the political consulting firm that worked for Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, testified in the British Parliament that a Palantir employee had helped Cambridge Analytica use the personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users to develop psychographic profiles of individual voters. Palantir said it has a strict policy against working on political issues, including campaigns, and showed Bloomberg emails in which it turned down Cambridge’s request to work with Palantir on multiple occasions. The employee, Palantir said, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-28/peter-thiel-s-palantir-says-rogue-employee-engaged-with-cambridge-analytica&quot;&gt;worked with Cambridge Analytica on his own time&lt;/a&gt;. Still, there was no mistaking the implications of the incident: All human relations are a matter of record, ready to be revealed by a clever algorithm. Everyone is a spidergram now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pic&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2018-palantir-peter-thiel/img/thiel.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thiel addresses the 2016 Republican National Convention. &lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sectionbreak&quot;&gt;Thiel, who turned 50 in October, long reveled as the libertarian black sheep in left-leaning Silicon Valley. He contributed $1.25 million to Trump’s presidential victory, spoke at the Republican convention, and has dined with Trump at the White House. But Thiel has told friends he’s had enough of the Bay Area’s “monocultural” liberalism. He’s ditching his longtime base in San Francisco and moving his personal investment firms this year to Los Angeles, where he plans to establish his next project, a conservative media empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Thiel’s wealth has grown, he’s gotten more strident. In a 2009 essay for the Cato Institute, he railed against taxes, ­government, women, poor people, and society’s acquiescence to the inevitability of death. (Thiel doesn’t accept death as inexorable.) He wrote that he’d reached some radical conclusions: “Most importantly, I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.” The 1920s was the last time one could feel “genuinely optimistic” about American democracy, he said; since then, “the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women—two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians—have rendered the notion of ‘capitalist democracy’ into an oxymoron.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thiel went into tech after missing a prized Supreme Court clerkship following his graduation from Stanford Law School. He co-founded PayPal and then parlayed his winnings from its 2002 sale to EBay Inc. into a career in venture investing. He made an early bet on Facebook Inc. (where he’s still on the board), which accounts for most of his $3.3 billion fortune, as estimated by Bloomberg, and launched his career as a backer of big ideas—things like private space travel (through an investment in SpaceX), hotel alternatives (Airbnb), and floating island nations (the Seasteading Institute).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He started Palantir—named after the omniscient crystal balls in J.R.R. Tolkien’s &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; trilogy—three years after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The CIA’s investment arm, In-Q-Tel, was a seed investor. For the role of chief executive officer, he chose an old law school friend and self-described neo-Marxist, Alex Karp. Thiel &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-11-22/palantir-the-war-on-terrors-secret-weapon&quot;&gt;told Bloomberg in 2011&lt;/a&gt; that civil libertarians ought to embrace Palantir, because data mining is less repressive than the “crazy abuses and draconian policies” proposed after Sept. 11. The best way to prevent another catastrophic attack without becoming a police state, he argued, was to give the government the best surveillance tools possible, while building in safeguards against their abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legend has it that Stephen Cohen, one of Thiel’s co-founders, programmed the initial prototype for Palantir’s software in two weeks. It took years, however, to coax customers away from the longtime leader in the intelligence analytics market, a software company called I2 Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one adventure missing from the glowing accounts of Palantir’s early rise, I2 accused Palantir of misappropriating its intellectual property through a Florida shell company registered to the family of a Palantir executive. A company claiming to be a private eye firm had been licensing I2 software and development tools and spiriting them to Palantir for more than four years. I2 said the cutout was registered to the family of Shyam Sankar, Palantir’s director of business development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pq&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in the privacy breaches at Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, the pressure to monetize data at tech companies is ceaseless&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I2 sued Palantir in federal court, alleging fraud, conspiracy, and copyright infringement. In its legal response, Palantir argued it had the right to appropriate I2’s code for the greater good. “What’s at stake here is the ability of critical national security, defense and intelligence agencies to access their own data and use it interoperably in whichever platform they choose in order to most effectively protect the citizenry,” Palantir said in its motion to dismiss I2’s suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motion was denied. Palantir agreed to pay I2 about $10 million to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-15/imagine-a-silicon-valley-of-the-sea&quot;&gt;settle the suit&lt;/a&gt;. I2 was sold to IBM in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sankar, Palantir employee No. 13 and now one of the company’s top executives, also showed up in another Palantir scandal: the company’s 2010 proposal for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to run a secret sabotage campaign against the group’s liberal opponents. Hacked emails released by the group Anonymous indicated that Palantir and two other defense contractors pitched outside lawyers for the organization on a plan to snoop on the families of progressive activists, create fake identities to infiltrate left-leaning groups, scrape social media with bots, and plant false information with liberal groups to subsequently discredit them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the emails emerged in the press, Palantir offered an explanation similar to the one it provided in March for its U.K.-based employee’s assistance to Cambridge Analytica: It was the work of a single rogue employee. The company never explained Sankar’s involvement. Karp &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2011/02/11/palantir-apologizes-for-wikileaks-attack-proposal-cuts-ties-with-hbgary/#f08124c5585e&quot;&gt;issued a public apology&lt;/a&gt; and said he and Palantir were deeply committed to progressive causes. Palantir set up an advisory panel on privacy and civil liberties, headed by a former CIA attorney, and beefed up an engineering group it calls the Privacy and Civil Liberties Team. The company now has about 10 PCL engineers on call to help vet clients’ requests for access to data troves and pitch in with pertinent thoughts about law, morality, and machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During its 14 years in startup mode, Palantir has cultivated a mystique as a haven for brilliant engineers who want to solve big problems such as terrorism and human trafficking, unfettered by pedestrian concerns such as making money. Palantir executives boast of not employing a single sales­person, relying instead on word-of-mouth referrals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company’s early data mining dazzled venture investors, who valued it at $20 billion in 2015. But Palantir has never reported a profit. It operates less like a conventional software company than like a consultancy, deploying roughly half its 2,000 engineers to client sites. That works at well-funded government spy agencies seeking specialized applications but has produced mixed results with corporate clients. Palantir’s high installation and maintenance costs repelled customers such as Hershey Co., which trumpeted a Palantir partnership in 2015 only to walk away two years later. Coca-Cola, Nasdaq, American Express, and Home Depot have also dumped Palantir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karp recognized the high-touch model was problematic early in the company’s push into the corporate market, but solutions have been elusive. “We didn’t want to be a services company. We wanted to do something that was cost-efficient,” he confessed at a European conference in 2010, in one of several unguarded comments captured in videos posted online. “Of course, what we didn’t recognize was that this would be much, much harder than we realized.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palantir’s newest product, Foundry, aims to finally break through the profitability barrier with more automation and less need for on-site engineers. Airbus SE, the big European plane maker, uses Foundry to crunch airline data about specific onboard components to track usage and maintenance and anticipate repair problems. Merck KGaA, the pharmaceutical giant, has a long-term Palantir contract to use Foundry in drug development and supply chain management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deeper adoption of Foundry in the commercial market is crucial to Palantir’s hopes of a big payday. Some investors are weary and have already written down their Palantir stakes. Morgan Stanley now values the company at $6 billion. Fred Alger Management Inc., which has owned stock since at least 2006, revalued Palantir in December at about $10 billion, according to Bloomberg Holdings. One frustrated investor, Marc Abramowitz, recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-22/palantir-must-turn-over-internal-files-to-company-investor&quot;&gt;won a court order&lt;/a&gt; for Palantir to show him its books, as part of a lawsuit he filed alleging the company sabotaged his attempt to find a buyer for the Palantir shares he has owned for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown in the privacy breaches at Facebook and Cambridge Analytica—with Thiel and Palantir linked to both sides of the equation—the pressure to monetize data at tech companies is ceaseless. Facebook didn’t grow from a website connecting college kids into a purveyor of user profiles and predilections worth $478 billion by walling off personal data. Palantir says its Privacy and Civil Liberties Team watches out for inappropriate data demands, but it consists of just 10 people in a company of 2,000 engineers. No one said no to JPMorgan, or to whomever at Palantir volunteered to help Cambridge Analytica—or to another organization keenly interested in state-of-the-art data science, the Los Angeles Police Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pic&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;padded&quot; src=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2018-palantir-peter-thiel/img/screengrab.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Gotham program&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Screenshots of Palantir’s Gotham program, from a promotional video. &lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Source: Youtube&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sectionbreak&quot;&gt;Palantir began work with the LAPD in 2009. The impetus was federal funding. After several Sept. 11 postmortems called for more intelligence sharing at all levels of law enforcement, money started flowing to Palantir to help build data integration systems for so-called fusion centers, starting in L.A. There are now more than 1,300 trained Palantir users at more than a half-dozen law enforcement agencies in Southern California, including local police and sheriff’s departments and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LAPD uses Palantir’s Gotham product for Operation Laser, a program to identify and deter people likely to commit crimes. Information from rap sheets, parole reports, police interviews, and other sources is fed into the system to generate a list of people the department defines as chronic offenders, says Craig Uchida, whose consulting firm, Justice &amp;amp; Security Strategies Inc., designed the Laser system. The list is distributed to patrolmen, with orders to monitor and stop the pre-crime suspects as often as possible, using excuses such as jaywalking or fix-it tickets. At each contact, officers fill out a field interview card with names, addresses, vehicles, physical descriptions, any neighborhood intelligence the person offers, and the officer’s own observations on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cards are digitized in the Palantir system, adding to a constantly expanding surveillance database that’s fully accessible without a warrant. Tomorrow’s data points are automatically linked to today’s, with the goal of generating investigative leads. Say a chronic offender is tagged as a passenger in a car that’s pulled over for a broken taillight. Two years later, that same car is spotted by an automatic license plate reader near a crime scene 200 miles across the state. As soon as the plate hits the system, Palantir alerts the officer who made the original stop that a car once linked to the chronic offender was spotted near a crime scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platform is supplemented with what sociologist &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122417725865&quot;&gt;Sarah Brayne&lt;/a&gt; calls the secondary surveillance network: the web of who is related to, friends with, or sleeping with whom. One woman in the system, for example, who wasn’t suspected of committing any crime, was identified as having multiple boyfriends within the same network of associates, says Brayne, who spent two and a half years embedded with the LAPD while researching her dissertation on big-data policing at Princeton University and who’s now an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin. “Anybody who logs into the system can see all these intimate ties,” she says. To widen the scope of possible connections, she adds, the LAPD has also explored purchasing private data, including social media, foreclosure, and toll road information, camera feeds from hospitals, parking lots, and universities, and delivery information from Papa John’s International Inc. and Pizza Hut LLC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;question&quot; readability=&quot;57&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;The Constitutionality Question&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why the courts haven’t ruled on whether Palantir’s analytical tools are legal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Civil rights advocates say the compilation of a digital dossier of someone’s life, absent a court warrant, is an unlawful intrusion under the U.S. Constitution. Law enforcement officials say that’s not the case. For now, the question is unsettled, and that may be no accident. Civil liberties lawyers are seeking a case to challenge the constitutionality of Palantir’s use, but prosecutors and immigration agents have been careful not to cite the software in evidentiary documents, says Paromita Shah, associate director of the National Lawyers Guild’s National Immigration Project. “Palantir lives on that secrecy,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the 1970s, the Supreme Court has differentiated between searching someone’s home or car, which requires a warrant, and searching material out in the open or shared with others, which doesn’t. The justices’ thinking seems to be evolving as new technologies rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2012 decision, &lt;em&gt;U.S. v. Jones&lt;/em&gt;, the justices said that planting a GPS tracker on a car for 28 days without a warrant created such a comprehensive picture of the target’s life that it violated the public’s reasonable expectation of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the court’s 2014 decision in &lt;em&gt;Riley v. California&lt;/em&gt; found that cellphones contain so much personal information that they provide a virtual window into the owner’s mind, and thus necessitate a warrant for the government to search. Chief Justice John Roberts, in his majority opinion, wrote of cellphones that “with all they contain and all they may reveal, they hold for many Americans ‘the privacies of life.’” Justice Louis Brandeis, 86 years earlier, wrote a searing dissent in a wiretap case that seems to perectly foresee the advent of Palantir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ways may someday be developed,” Brandeis warned, “by which the government, without removing papers from secret drawers, can reproduce them in court, and by which it will be enabled to expose to a jury the most intimate occurrences.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Peter Waldman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LAPD declined to comment for this story. Palantir sent Bloomberg a statement about its work with law enforcement: “Our [forward-deployed engineers] and [privacy and civil liberties] engineers work with the law enforcement customers (including LAPD) to ensure that the implementation of our software and integration of their source systems with the software is consistent with the Department’s legal and policy obligations, as well as privacy and civil liberties considerations that may not currently be legislated but are on the horizon. We as a company determine the types of engagements and general applications of our software with respect to those overarching considerations. Police Agencies have internal responsibility for ensuring that their information systems are used in a manner consistent with their policies and procedures.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operation Laser has made L.A. cops more surgical—and, according to community activists, unrelenting. Once targets are enmeshed in a spidergram, they’re stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manuel Rios, 22, lives in the back of his grandmother’s house at the top of a hill in East L.A., in the heart of the city’s gang area. Tall with a fair complexion and light hair, he struggled in high school with depression and a learning disability and dropped out to work at a supermarket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He grew up surrounded by friends who joined Eastside 18, the local affiliate of the 18th Street gang, one of the largest criminal syndicates in Southern California. Rios says he was never “jumped in”—initiated into 18. He spent years addicted to crystal meth and was once arrested for possession of a handgun and sentenced to probation. But except for a stint in county jail for a burglary arrest inside a city rec center, he’s avoided further trouble and says he kicked his meth habit last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, Rios was sitting in a parked car with an Eastside 18 friend when a police car pulled up. His buddy ran, pursued by the cops, but Rios stayed put. “Why should I run? I’m not a gang member,” he says over steak and eggs at the IHOP near his home. The police returned and handcuffed him. One of them took his picture with a cellphone. “Welcome to the gang database!” the officer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then he’s been stopped more than a dozen times, he says, and told that if he doesn’t like it he should move. He has nowhere to go. His girlfriend just had a baby girl, and he wants to be around for them. “They say you’re in the system, you can’t lie to us,” he says. “I tell them, ‘How can I be in the hood if I haven’t got jumped in? Can’t you guys tell people who bang and who don’t?’ They go by their facts, not the real facts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police, on autopilot with Palantir, are driving Rios toward his gang friends, not away from them, worries Mariella Saba, a neighbor and community organizer who helped him get off meth. When whole communities like East L.A. are algorithmically scraped for pre-crime suspects, data is destiny, says Saba. “These are systemic processes. When people are constantly harassed in a gang context, it pushes them to join. They internalize being told they’re bad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chicago, at least two immigrants have been detained for deportation by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers based on erroneous information in gang databases, according to a pair of federal lawsuits. Chicago is a sanctuary city, so it isn’t clear how ICE found out about the purported gang affiliations. But Palantir is a likely link. The company provided an “intelligence management solution” for the Cook County Sheriff’s Office to integrate information from at least 14 different databases, including gang lists compiled by state and local police departments, according to county records. Palantir also has a $41 million data mining contract with ICE to build the agency’s “investigative case management” system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the detained men, Wilmer Catalan-Ramirez, a 31-year-old body shop mechanic, was seriously injured when six ICE agents burst into his family’s home last March without a warrant. He’d been listed in the local gang database twice—in rival gangs. Catalan-Ramirez spent the next nine months in federal detention, until the city of Chicago admitted both listings were wrong and agreed to petition the feds to let him stay in the U.S. ICE released him in January, pending a new visa application. “These cases are perfect examples of how databases filled with unverified information that is often false can destroy people’s lives,” says his attorney, Vanessa del Valle of Northwestern University’s MacArthur Justice Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pq&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When whole communities are algorithmically scraped for pre-crime suspects, data is destiny&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sectionbreak&quot;&gt;Palantir is twice the age most startups are when they cash out in a sale or initial public offering. The company needs to figure out how to be rewarded on Wall Street without creeping out Main Street. It might not be possible. For all of Palantir’s professed concern for individuals’ privacy, the single most important safeguard against abuse is the one it’s trying desperately to reduce through automation: human judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Palantir tries to court corporate customers as a more conventional software company, fewer forward-deployed engineers will mean fewer human decisions. Sensitive questions, such as how deeply to pry into people’s lives, will be answered increasingly by artificial intelligence and machine-learning algorithms. The small team of Privacy and Civil Liberties engineers could find themselves even less influential, as the urge for omnipotence among clients overwhelms any self-imposed restraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computers don’t ask moral questions; people do, says John Grant, one of Palantir’s top PCL engineers and a forceful advocate for mandatory ethics education for engineers. “At a company like ours with millions of lines of code, every tiny decision could have huge implications,” Grant told a privacy conference in Berkeley last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan’s experience remains instructive. “The world changed when it became clear everyone could be targeted using Palantir,” says a former JPMorgan cyber expert who worked with Cavicchia at one point on the insider threat team. “Nefarious ideas became trivial to implement; everyone’s a suspect, so we monitored everything. It was a pretty terrible feeling.” &lt;em&gt;—With Michael Riley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook to change user terms, limiting effect of EU privacy law</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-privacy-eu-exclusive/exclusive-facebook-to-change-user-terms-limiting-effect-of-eu-privacy-law-idUSKBN1HQ00P</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-privacy-eu-exclusive/exclusive-facebook-to-change-user-terms-limiting-effect-of-eu-privacy-law-idUSKBN1HQ00P</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - If a new European law restricting what companies can do with people’s online data went into effect tomorrow, almost 1.9 billion Facebook Inc users around the world would be protected by it. The online social network is making changes that ensure the number will be much smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook members outside the United States and Canada, whether they know it or not, are currently governed by terms of service agreed with the company’s international headquarters in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next month, Facebook is planning to make that the case for only European users, meaning 1.5 billion members in Africa, Asia, Australia and Latin America will not fall under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which takes effect on May 25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previously unreported move, which Facebook confirmed to Reuters on Tuesday, shows the world’s largest online social network is keen to reduce its exposure to GDPR, which allows European regulators to fine companies for collecting or using personal data without users’ consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That removes a huge potential liability for Facebook, as the new EU law allows for fines of up to 4 percent of global annual revenue for infractions, which in Facebook’s case could mean billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change comes as Facebook is under scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers around the world since disclosing last month that the personal information of millions of users wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, setting off wider concerns about how it handles user data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change affects more than 70 percent of Facebook’s 2 billion-plus members. As of December, Facebook had 239 million users in the United States and Canada, 370 million in Europe and 1.52 billion users elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, like many other U.S. technology companies, established an Irish subsidiary in 2008 and took advantage of the country’s low corporate tax rates, routing through it revenue from some advertisers outside North America. The unit is subject to regulations applied by the 28-nation European Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook said the latest change does not have tax implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‘IN SPIRIT’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement given to Reuters, Facebook played down the importance of the terms of service change, saying it plans to make the privacy controls and settings that Europe will get under GDPR available to the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We apply the same privacy protections everywhere, regardless of whether your agreement is with Facebook Inc or Facebook Ireland,” the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told Reuters in an interview that his company would apply the EU law globally “in spirit,” but stopped short of committing to it as the standard for the social network across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, the change means the 1.5 billion affected users will not be able to file complaints with Ireland’s Data Protection Commissioner or in Irish courts. Instead they will be governed by more lenient U.S. privacy laws, said Michael Veale, a technology policy researcher at University College London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook will have more leeway in how it handles data about those users, Veale said. Certain types of data such as browsing history, for instance, are considered personal data under EU law but are not as protected in the United States, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said its rationale for the change was related to the European Union’s mandated privacy notices, “because EU law requires specific language.” For example, the company said, the new EU law requires specific legal terminology about the legal basis for processing data which does not exist in U.S. law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;NO WARNING&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ireland was unaware of the change. One Irish official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he did not know of any plans by Facebook to transfer responsibilities wholesale to the United States or to decrease Facebook’s presence in Ireland, where the social network is seeking to recruit more than 100 new staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook released a revised terms of service in draft form two weeks ago, and they are scheduled to take effect next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other multinational companies are also planning changes. LinkedIn, a unit of Microsoft Corp, tells users in its existing terms of service that if they are outside the United States, they have a contract with LinkedIn Ireland. New terms that take effect May 8 move non-Europeans to contracts with U.S.-based LinkedIn Corp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn said in a statement on Wednesday that all users are entitled to the same privacy protections. “We’ve simply streamlined the contract location to ensure all members understand the LinkedIn entity responsible for their personal data,” the company said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;To our shareowners:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Customer Satisfaction Index recently announced the results of its annual survey, and for the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; year in a row customers ranked Amazon #1. The United Kingdom has a similar index, The U.K. Customer Satisfaction Index, put out by the Institute of Customer Service. For the 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; time in a row Amazon U.K. ranked #1 in that survey. Amazon was also just named the #1 business on LinkedIn’s 2018 Top Companies list, which ranks the most sought after places to work for professionals in the United States. And just a few weeks ago, Harris Poll released its annual Reputation Quotient, which surveys over 25,000 consumers on a broad range of topics from workplace environment to social responsibility to products and services, and for the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; year in a row Amazon ranked #1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations and thank you to the now over 560,000 Amazonians who come to work every day with unrelenting customer obsession, ingenuity, and commitment to operational excellence. And on behalf of Amazonians everywhere, I want to extend a huge thank you to customers. It’s incredibly energizing for us to see your responses to these surveys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I love about customers is that they are divinely discontent. Their expectations are never static – they go up. It’s human nature. We didn’t ascend from our hunter-gatherer days by being satisfied. People have a voracious appetite for a better way, and yesterday’s ‘wow’ quickly becomes today’s ‘ordinary’. I see that cycle of improvement happening at a faster rate than ever before. It may be because customers have such easy access to more information than ever before – in only a few seconds and with a couple taps on their phones, customers can read reviews, compare prices from multiple retailers, see whether something’s in stock, find out how fast it will ship or be available for &lt;span&gt;pick-up,&lt;/span&gt; and more. These examples are from retail, but I sense that the same customer empowerment phenomenon is happening broadly across everything we do at Amazon and most other industries as well. You cannot rest on your laurels in this world. Customers won’t have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you stay ahead of ever-rising customer expectations? There’s no single way to do it – it’s a combination of many things. But &lt;em&gt;high standards&lt;/em&gt; (widely deployed and at all levels of detail) are certainly a big part of it. We’ve had some successes over the years in our quest to meet the high expectations of customers. We’ve also had billions of dollars’ worth of failures along the way. With those experiences as backdrop, I’d like to share with you the essentials of what we’ve learned (so far) about high standards inside an organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intrinsic or Teachable?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there’s a foundational question: are high standards intrinsic or teachable? If you take me on your basketball team, you can teach me many things, but you can’t teach me to be taller. Do we first and foremost need to &lt;em&gt;select&lt;/em&gt; for “high standards” people? If so, this letter would need to be mostly about hiring practices, but I don’t think so. I believe high standards are teachable. In fact, people are pretty good at learning high standards simply through exposure. High standards are contagious. Bring a new person onto a high standards team, and they’ll quickly adapt. The opposite is also true. If low standards prevail, those too will quickly spread. And though exposure works well to teach high standards, I believe you can accelerate that rate of learning by articulating a few core principles of high standards, which I hope to share in this letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Universal or Domain Specific?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important question is whether high standards are universal or domain specific. In other words, if you have high standards in one area, do you automatically have high standards elsewhere? I believe high standards are domain specific, and that you have to learn high standards separately in every arena of interest. When I started Amazon, I had high standards on inventing, on customer care, and (thankfully) on hiring. But I didn’t have high standards on operational process: how to keep fixed problems fixed, how to eliminate defects at the root, how to inspect processes, and much more. I had to learn and develop high standards on all of that (my colleagues were my tutors).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;hr size=&quot;3&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding this point is important because it keeps you humble. You can consider yourself a person of high standards &lt;em&gt;in general&lt;/em&gt; and still have debilitating blind spots. There can be whole arenas of endeavor where you may not even &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that your standards are low or &lt;span&gt;non-existent,&lt;/span&gt; and certainly not world class. It’s critical to be open to that likelihood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recognition and Scope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you need to achieve high standards in a particular domain area? First, you have to be able to &lt;em&gt;recognize&lt;/em&gt; what good looks like in that domain. Second, you must have realistic expectations for how hard it should be (how much work it will take) to achieve that result – the &lt;em&gt;scope&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me give you two examples. One is a sort of toy illustration but it makes the point clearly, and another is a real one that comes up at Amazon all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perfect Handstands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A close friend recently decided to learn to do a perfect free-standing handstand. No leaning against a wall. Not for just a few seconds. Instagram good. She decided to start her journey by taking a handstand workshop at her yoga studio. She then practiced for a while but wasn’t getting the results she wanted. So, she hired a handstand coach. Yes, I know what you’re thinking, but evidently this is an actual thing that exists. In the very first lesson, the coach gave her some wonderful advice. “Most people,” he said, “think that if they work hard, they should be able to master a handstand in about two weeks. The reality is that it takes about six months of daily practice. If you think you should be able to do it in two weeks, you’re just going to end up quitting.” Unrealistic beliefs on scope – often hidden and undiscussed – kill high standards. To achieve high standards yourself or as part of a team, you need to form and proactively communicate realistic beliefs about how hard something is going to be – something this coach understood well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Six-Page&lt;/span&gt; Narratives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t do PowerPoint (or any other slide-oriented) presentations at Amazon. Instead, we write narratively structured &lt;span&gt;six-page&lt;/span&gt; memos. We silently read one at the beginning of each meeting in a kind of “study hall.” Not surprisingly, the quality of these memos varies widely. Some have the clarity of angels singing. They are brilliant and thoughtful and set up the meeting for high-quality discussion. Sometimes they come in at the other end of the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the handstand example, it’s pretty straightforward to &lt;em&gt;recognize&lt;/em&gt; high standards. It wouldn’t be difficult to lay out in detail the requirements of a well-executed handstand, and then you’re either doing it or you’re not. The writing example is very different. The difference between a great memo and an average one is much squishier. It would be extremely hard to write down the detailed requirements that make up a great memo. Nevertheless, I find that much of the time, readers react to great memos very similarly. They know it when they see it. The standard is there, and it is real, even if it’s not easily describable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what we’ve figured out. Often, when a memo isn’t great, it’s not the writer’s inability to &lt;em&gt;recognize&lt;/em&gt; the high standard, but instead a wrong expectation on &lt;em&gt;scope&lt;/em&gt;: they mistakenly believe a high-standards, &lt;span&gt;six-page&lt;/span&gt; memo can be written in one or two days or even a few hours, when really it might take a week or more! They’re trying to perfect a handstand in just two weeks, and we’re not coaching them right. The great memos are written and &lt;span&gt;re-written,&lt;/span&gt; shared with colleagues who are asked to improve the work, set aside for a couple of days, and then edited again with a fresh mind. They simply can’t be done in a day or two. The key point here is that you can improve results through the simple act of teaching scope – that a great memo probably should take a week or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond recognizing the standard and having realistic expectations on scope, how about &lt;em&gt;skill&lt;/em&gt;? Surely to write a world class memo, you have to be an extremely skilled writer? Is it another required element? In my view, not so much, at least not for the individual in the context of teams. The football coach doesn’t need to be able to throw, and a film director doesn’t need to be able to act. But they both do need to recognize high standards for those things and teach realistic expectations on scope. Even in the example of writing a &lt;span&gt;six-page&lt;/span&gt; memo, that’s&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr size=&quot;3&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;teamwork. &lt;em&gt;Someone&lt;/em&gt; on the team needs to have the skill, but it doesn’t have to be you. (As a side note, by tradition at Amazon, authors’ names never appear on the memos – the memo is from the whole team.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits of High Standards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a culture of high standards is well worth the effort, and there are many benefits. Naturally and most obviously, you’re going to build better products and services for customers – this would be reason enough! Perhaps a little less obvious: people are drawn to high standards – they help with recruiting and retention. More subtle: a culture of high standards is protective of all the “invisible” but crucial work that goes on in every company. I’m talking about the work that no one sees. The work that gets done when no one is watching. In a high standards culture, doing that work well is its own reward – it’s part of what it means to be a professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, high standards are fun! Once you’ve tasted high standards, there’s no going back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the four elements of high standards as we see it: they are &lt;em&gt;teachable&lt;/em&gt;, they are &lt;em&gt;domain specific&lt;/em&gt;, you must &lt;em&gt;recognize&lt;/em&gt; them, and you must explicitly coach realistic &lt;em&gt;scope&lt;/em&gt;. For us, these work at all levels of detail. Everything from writing memos to whole new, clean-sheet business initiatives. We hope they help you too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Insist on the Highest Standards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Leaders have relentlessly high standards – many people may think these standards are unreasonably high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;-- from the Amazon Leadership Principles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recent Milestones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high standards our leaders strive for have served us well. And while I certainly can’t do a handstand myself, I’m extremely proud to share some of the milestones we hit last year, each of which represents the fruition of many years of collective effort. We take none of them for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Prime&lt;/u&gt; – 13 years post-launch, we have exceeded 100 million paid Prime members globally. In 2017 Amazon shipped more than five billion items with Prime worldwide, and more new members joined Prime than in any previous year – both worldwide and in the U.S. Members in the U.S. now receive unlimited free &lt;span&gt;two-day&lt;/span&gt; shipping on over 100 million different items. We expanded Prime to Mexico, Singapore, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, and introduced Business Prime Shipping in the U.S. and Germany. We keep making Prime shipping faster as well, with Prime Free &lt;span&gt;Same-Day&lt;/span&gt; and Prime Free &lt;span&gt;One-Day&lt;/span&gt; delivery now in more than 8,000 cities and towns. Prime Now is available in more than 50 cities worldwide across nine countries. Prime Day 2017 was our biggest global shopping event ever (until surpassed by Cyber Monday), with more new Prime members joining Prime than any other day in our history.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;AWS&lt;/u&gt; – It’s exciting to see Amazon Web Services, a $20 billion revenue run rate business, accelerate its already healthy growth. AWS has also accelerated its pace of innovation – especially in new areas such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, and serverless computing. In 2017, AWS announced more than 1,400 significant services and features, including Amazon SageMaker, which radically changes the accessibility and ease of use for everyday developers to build sophisticated machine learning models. Tens of thousands of customers are also using a broad range of AWS machine learning services, with active users increasing more than 250 percent in the last year, spurred by the broad adoption of Amazon SageMaker. And in November, we held our sixth re:Invent conference with more than 40,000 attendees and over 60,000 streaming participants.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; readability=&quot;5.5&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;5%&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Marketplace&lt;/u&gt; – In 2017, for the first time in our history, more than half of the units sold on Amazon worldwide were from our third-party sellers, including small and &lt;span&gt;medium-sized&lt;/span&gt; businesses (SMBs). Over 300,000 U.S.-based SMBs started selling on Amazon in 2017, and Fulfillment by Amazon shipped billions of items for SMBs worldwide. Customers ordered more than 40 million items from SMBs worldwide during Prime Day 2017, growing their sales by more than 60 percent over Prime Day 2016. Our Global Selling program (enabling SMBs to sell products across national borders) grew by over 50% in 2017 and cross-border ecommerce by SMBs now represents more than 25% of total third-party sales.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;hr size=&quot;3&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;5%&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Alexa&lt;/u&gt; – Customer embrace of Alexa continues, with Alexa-enabled devices among the best-selling items across all of Amazon. We’re seeing extremely strong adoption by other companies and developers that want to create their own experiences with Alexa. There are now more than 30,000 skills for Alexa from outside developers, and customers can control more than 4,000 smart home devices from 1,200 unique brands with Alexa. The foundations of Alexa continue to get smarter every day too. We’ve developed and implemented an &lt;span&gt;on-device&lt;/span&gt; fingerprinting technique, which keeps your device from waking up when it hears an Alexa commercial on TV. (This technology ensured that our Alexa Super Bowl commercial didn’t wake up millions of devices.) &lt;span&gt;Far-field&lt;/span&gt; speech recognition (already very good) has improved by 15% over the last year; and in the U.S., U.K., and Germany, we’ve improved Alexa’s spoken language understanding by more than 25% over the last 12 months through enhancements in Alexa’s machine learning components and the use of semi-supervised learning techniques. (These semi-supervised learning techniques reduced the amount of labeled data needed to achieve the same accuracy improvement by 40 times!) Finally, we’ve dramatically reduced the amount of time required to teach Alexa new languages by using machine translation and transfer learning techniques, which allows us to serve customers in more countries (like India and Japan).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Amazon devices&lt;/u&gt; – 2017 was our best year yet for hardware sales. Customers bought tens of millions of Echo devices, and Echo Dot and Fire TV Stick with Alexa were the best-selling products across all of Amazon – across all categories and all manufacturers. Customers bought twice as many Fire TV Sticks and Kids Edition Fire Tablets this holiday season versus last year. 2017 marked the release of our &lt;span&gt;all-new&lt;/span&gt; Echo with an improved design, better sound, and a lower price; Echo Plus with a &lt;span&gt;built-in&lt;/span&gt; smart home hub; and Echo Spot, which is compact and beautiful with a circular screen. We released our next generation Fire TV, featuring 4K Ultra HD and HDR; and the Fire HD 10 Tablet, with 1080p Full HD display. And we celebrated the 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary of Kindle by releasing the &lt;span&gt;all-new&lt;/span&gt; Kindle Oasis, our most advanced reader ever. It’s waterproof – take it in the bathtub – with a bigger 7” high-resolution 300 ppi display and has &lt;span&gt;built-in&lt;/span&gt; audio so you can also listen to your books with Audible.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Prime Video&lt;/u&gt; – Prime Video continues to drive Prime member adoption and retention. In the last year we made Prime Video even better for customers by adding new, award-winning Prime Originals to the service, like&lt;em&gt; The Marvelous Mrs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Maisel&lt;/em&gt;, winner of two Critics’ Choice Awards and two Golden Globes, and the Oscar-nominated movie&lt;em&gt; The Big Sick&lt;/em&gt;. We’ve expanded our slate of programming across the globe, launching new seasons of&lt;em&gt; Bosch&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; Sneaky Pete&lt;/em&gt; from the U.S.,&lt;em&gt; The Grand Tour&lt;/em&gt; from the U.K., and&lt;em&gt; You Are Wanted&lt;/em&gt; from Germany, while adding new &lt;em&gt;Sentosha&lt;/em&gt; shows from Japan, along with&lt;em&gt; Breathe&lt;/em&gt; and the award-winning&lt;em&gt; Inside Edge&lt;/em&gt; from India. Also this year, we expanded our Prime Channels offerings, adding CBS All Access in the U.S. and launching Channels in the U.K. and Germany. We debuted&lt;em&gt; NFL Thursday Night Football&lt;/em&gt; on Prime Video, with more than 18 million total viewers over 11 games. In 2017, Prime Video Direct secured subscription video rights for more than 3,000 feature films and committed over $18 million in royalties to independent filmmakers and other rights holders. Looking forward, we’re also excited about our upcoming Prime Original series pipeline, which includes&lt;em&gt; Tom Clancy’s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Jack Ryan&lt;/em&gt; starring John Krasinski;&lt;em&gt; King Lear,&lt;/em&gt; starring Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson;&lt;em&gt; The&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Romanoffs,&lt;/em&gt; executive produced by Matt Weiner;&lt;em&gt; Carnival Row&lt;/em&gt; starring Orlando Bloom and Cara Delevingne;&lt;em&gt; Good Omens&lt;/em&gt; starring Jon Hamm; and&lt;em&gt; Homecoming,&lt;/em&gt; executive produced by Sam Esmail and starring Julia Roberts in her first television series. We acquired the global television rights for a multi-season production of&lt;em&gt; The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;, as well as&lt;em&gt; Cortés&lt;/em&gt;, a miniseries based on the epic saga of Hernán Cortés from executive producer Steven Spielberg, starring Javier Bardem, and we look forward to beginning work on those shows this year.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Amazon Music&lt;/u&gt; – Amazon Music continues to grow fast and now has tens of millions of paid customers. Amazon Music Unlimited, our &lt;span&gt;on-demand,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;ad-free&lt;/span&gt; offering, expanded to more than 30 new countries in 2017, and membership has more than doubled over the past six months.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Fashion&lt;/u&gt; – Amazon has become the destination for tens of millions of customers to shop for fashion. In 2017, we introduced our first fashion-oriented Prime benefit, Prime Wardrobe – a new service that brings the fitting room directly to the homes of Prime members so they can try on the latest styles before they buy. We introduced Nike and UGG on Amazon along with new celebrity collections by Drew Barrymore and Dwyane Wade, as well as dozens of new private brands, like Goodthreads and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core10. We’re also continuing to enable thousands of designers and artists to offer their exclusive designs and prints on demand through Merch by Amazon. We finished 2017 with the launch of our interactive shopping experience with Calvin Klein, including &lt;span&gt;pop-up&lt;/span&gt; shops, &lt;span&gt;on-site&lt;/span&gt; product customization, and fitting rooms with Alexa-controlled lighting, music, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Whole Foods&lt;/u&gt; – When we closed our acquisition of Whole Foods Market last year, we announced our commitment to making high-quality, natural and organic food available for everyone, then immediately lowered prices on a selection of best-selling grocery staples, including avocados, organic brown eggs, and responsibly-farmed salmon. We followed this with a second round of price reductions in November, and our Prime member exclusive promotion broke Whole Foods’ &lt;span&gt;all-time&lt;/span&gt; record for turkeys sold during the Thanksgiving season. In February, we introduced free &lt;span&gt;two-hour&lt;/span&gt; delivery on orders over $35 for Prime members in select cities, followed by additional cities in March and April, and plan continued expansion across the U.S. throughout this year. We also expanded the benefits of the Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Card, enabling Prime members to get 5% back when shopping at Whole Foods Market. Beyond that, customers can purchase Whole Foods’ private label products like 365 Everyday Value on Amazon, purchase Echo and other Amazon devices in over a hundred Whole Foods stores, and &lt;span&gt;pick-up&lt;/span&gt; or return Amazon packages at Amazon Lockers in hundreds of Whole Foods stores. We’ve also begun the technical work needed to recognize Prime members at the point of sale and look forward to offering more Prime benefits to Whole Foods shoppers once that work is completed.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Amazon Go&lt;/u&gt; – Amazon Go, a new kind of store with no checkout required, opened to the public in January in Seattle. Since opening, we’ve been thrilled to hear many customers refer to their shopping experience as “magical.” What makes the magic possible is a custom-built combination of computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning, which come together to create Just Walk Out shopping. With JWO, customers are able to grab their favorite breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, and grocery essentials more conveniently than ever before. Some of our &lt;span&gt;top-selling&lt;/span&gt; items are not surprising – caffeinated beverages and water are popular – but our customers also love the Chicken Banh Mi sandwich, chocolate chip cookies, cut fruit, gummy bears, and our Amazon Meal Kits.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Treasure Truck&lt;/u&gt; – Treasure Truck expanded from a single truck in Seattle to a fleet of 35 trucks across 25 U.S. cities and 12 U.K. cities. Our bubble-blowing, music-pumping trucks fulfilled hundreds of thousands of orders, from porterhouse steaks to the latest Nintendo releases. Throughout the year, Treasure Truck also partnered with local communities to lift spirits and help those in need, including donating and delivering hundreds of car seats, thousands of toys, tens of thousands of socks, and many other essentials to community members needing relief, from those displaced by Hurricane Harvey, to the homeless, to kids needing holiday cheer.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;India&lt;/u&gt; – Amazon.in is the fastest growing marketplace in India, and the most visited site on both desktop and mobile, according to comScore and SimilarWeb. The Amazon.in mobile shopping app was also the most downloaded shopping app in India in 2017, according to App Annie. Prime added more members in India in its first year than any previous geography in Amazon’s history. Prime selection in India now includes more than 40 million local products from third-party sellers, and Prime Video is investing in India original video content in a big way, including two recent premiers and over a dozen new shows in production.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sustainability&lt;/u&gt; – We are committed to minimizing carbon emissions by optimizing our transportation network, improving product packaging, and enhancing energy efficiency in our operations, and we have a long-term goal to power our global infrastructure using 100% renewable energy. We recently launched Amazon Wind Farm Texas, our largest wind farm yet, which generates more than 1,000,000 megawatt hours of clean energy annually from over 100 turbines. We have plans to host solar energy systems at 50 fulfillment centers by 2020, and have launched 24 wind and solar projects across the U.S. with more than 29 additional projects to come. Together, Amazon’s renewable energy projects now produce enough clean energy to power over 330,000 homes annually. In 2017 we celebrated the &lt;span&gt;10-year&lt;/span&gt; anniversary of Frustration-Free Packaging, the first of a suite of sustainable packaging initiatives that have eliminated more than 244,000 tons of packaging materials over the past 10 years. In addition, in 2017 alone our programs significantly reduced packaging waste, eliminating the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;equivalent of 305 million shipping boxes. And across the world, Amazon is contracting with our service providers to launch our first &lt;span&gt;low-pollution&lt;/span&gt; last-mile fleet. Already today, a portion of our European delivery fleet is comprised of &lt;span&gt;low-pollution&lt;/span&gt; electric and natural gas vans and cars, and we have over 40 electric scooters and &lt;span&gt;e-cargo&lt;/span&gt; bikes that complete local urban deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Empowering Small Business&lt;/u&gt; – Millions of small and &lt;span&gt;medium-sized&lt;/span&gt; businesses worldwide now sell their products through Amazon to reach new customers around the globe. SMBs selling on Amazon come from every state in the U.S., and from more than 130 different countries around the world. More than 140,000 SMBs surpassed $100,000 in sales on Amazon in 2017, and over a thousand independent authors surpassed $100,000 in royalties in 2017 through Kindle Direct Publishing.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Investment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt; &amp;amp; Job Creation&lt;/u&gt; – Since 2011, we have invested over $150 billion worldwide in our fulfillment networks, transportation capabilities, and technology infrastructure, including AWS data centers. Amazon has created over 1.7 million direct and indirect jobs around the world. In 2017 alone, we directly created more than 130,000 new Amazon jobs, not including acquisitions, bringing our global employee base to over 560,000. Our new jobs cover a wide range of professions, from artificial intelligence scientists to packaging specialists to fulfillment center associates. In addition to these direct hires, we estimate that Amazon Marketplace has created 900,000 more jobs worldwide, and that Amazon’s investments have created an additional 260,000 jobs in areas like construction, logistics, and other professional services.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Career Choice&lt;/u&gt; – One employee program we’re particularly proud of is Amazon Career Choice. For hourly associates with more than one year of tenure, we &lt;span&gt;pre-pay&lt;/span&gt; 95% of tuition, fees, and textbooks (up to $12,000) for certificates and associate degrees in high-demand occupations such as aircraft mechanics, computer-aided design, machine tool technologies, medical lab technologies, and nursing. We fund education in areas that are in high demand and do so regardless of whether those skills are relevant to a career at Amazon. Globally more than 16,000 associates (including more than 12,000 in the U.S.) have joined Career Choice since the program launched in 2012. Career Choice is live in ten countries and expanding to South Africa, Costa Rica, and Slovakia later this year. Commercial truck driving, healthcare, and information technology are the program’s most popular fields of study. We’ve built 39 Career Choice classrooms so far, and we locate them behind glass walls in high traffic areas inside our fulfillment centers so associates can be inspired by seeing their peers pursue new skills.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;The credit for these milestones is deserved by many. Amazon is 560,000 employees. It’s also 2 million sellers, hundreds of thousands of authors, millions of AWS developers, and hundreds of millions of divinely discontent customers around the world who push to make us better each and every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Path Ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year marks the 20th anniversary of our first shareholder letter, and our core values and approach remain unchanged. We continue to aspire to be Earth’s most customer-centric company, and we recognize this to be no small or easy challenge. We know there is much we can do better, and we find tremendous energy in the many challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A huge thank you to each and every customer for allowing us to serve you, to our shareowners for your support, and to Amazonians everywhere for your ingenuity, your passion, and your high standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, I attach a copy of our original 1997 letter. It remains Day 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1997 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Reprinted from the 1997 Annual Report)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To our shareholders:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Amazon.com passed many milestones in 1997: by year-end, we had served more than 1.5 million customers, yielding 838% revenue growth to $147.8 million, and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But this is Day 1 for the Internet and, if we execute well, for Amazon.com. Today, online commerce saves customers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so, hopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers, new to purchasing online, are receptive to forming new relationships. The competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible offerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, traffic, and sales. Our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas. We see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting. This strategy is not without risk: it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s All About the Long Term&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the &lt;em&gt;long term&lt;/em&gt;. This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position. The stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our decisions have consistently reflected this focus. We first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies. Accordingly, we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision-making approach so that you, our shareholders, may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;4%&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width=&quot;1%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations rather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;4%&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td width=&quot;1%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We will continue to measure our programs and the effectiveness of our investments analytically, to jettison those that do not provide acceptable returns, and to step up our investment in those that work best. We will continue to learn from both our successes and our failures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;hr size=&quot;3&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;4%&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td width=&quot;1%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability of gaining market leadership advantages. Some of these investments will pay off, others will not, and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;When forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our GAAP accounting and maximizing the present value of future cash flows, we’ll take the cash flows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We will share our strategic thought processes with you when we make bold choices (to the extent competitive pressures allow), so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational long-term leadership investments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width=&quot;1%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture. We understand the importance of continually reinforcing a cost-conscious culture, particularly in a business incurring net losses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; readability=&quot;2.5&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;4%&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long-term profitability and capital management. At this stage, we choose to prioritize growth because we believe that scale is central to achieving the potential of our business model.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; readability=&quot;4.5&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;13.5&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;4%&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;2%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;•&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;1%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees, and continue to weight their compensation to stock options rather than cash. We know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base, each of whom must think like, and therefore must actually be, an owner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We aren’t so bold as to claim that the above is the “right” investment philosophy, but it’s ours, and we would be remiss if we weren’t clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With this foundation, we would like to turn to a review of our business focus, our progress in 1997, and our outlook for the future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Obsess Over Customers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;From the beginning, our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value. We realized that the Web was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-to-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offer customers gift certificates, 1-Click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;SM&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;shopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and recommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leader in online bookselling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;4%&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sales grew from $15.7 million in 1996 to $147.8 million – an 838% increase.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over 46% in the fourth quarter of 1996 to over 58% in the same period in 1997.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We established long-term relationships with many important strategic partners, including America Online, Yahoo!, Excite, Netscape, GeoCities, AltaVista, @Home, and Prodigy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;During 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased traffic, sales, and service levels:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our cash and investment balances at year-end were $125 million, thanks to our initial public offering in May 1997 and our $75 million loan, affording us substantial strategic flexibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our Employees&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The past year’s success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in being a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the single most important element of Amazon.com’s success.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, “You can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you can’t choose two out of three”), but we are working to build something important, something that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren’t meant to be easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion build Amazon.com.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Goals for 1998&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet commerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base. This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience, selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience. To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but in prioritizing our investments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several: aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity. However, as we’ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to be a very large market, and it’s likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good about what we’ve done, and even more excited about what we want to do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jeffrey P. Bezos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Founder and Chief Executive Officer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Amazon.com, Inc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Login-with-Facebook data hijacked by JavaScript trackers</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/18/login-with-facebook-data-hijacked-by-javascript-trackers/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/facebook/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;facebook&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; confirms to TechCrunch that it’s investigating a security research report that shows Facebook user data can be grabbed by third-party JavaScript trackers embedded on websites using Login With Facebook. The exploit lets these trackers gather a user’s data including name, email address, age range, gender, locale, and profile photo depending on what users originally provided to the website. It’s unclear what these trackers do with the data, but many of their parent companies including Tealium, AudienceStream, Lytics, and ProPS sell publisher monetization services based on collected user data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-1624630 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/third_party_exfiltration.png?w=680&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;318&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abusive scripts were found on 434 of the top 1 million websites including cloud database provider MongoDB. That’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2018/04/18/no-boundaries-for-facebook-data-third-party-trackers-abuse-facebook-login/&quot;&gt;according to Steven Englehardt and his colleagues at Freedom To Tinker&lt;/a&gt;, which is hosted by Princeton’s Center For Information Technology Policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, concert site BandsInTown was found to be passing Login With Facebook user data to embedded scripts on sites that install its Amplified advertising product. An invisible BandsInTown iframe would load on these sites, pulling in user data that was then accessible to embedded scripts. That let any malicious site using BandsInTown learn the identity of visitors. BandsInTown has now fixed this vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TechCrunch is still awaiting a formal statement from Facebook beyond “We will look into this and get back to you.” After TechCrunch brough the issue to MongoDB’s attention this morning, it investigated and just provided this statement “We were unaware that a third-party technology was using a tracking script that collects parts of Facebook user data. We have identified the source of the script and shut it down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BandsInTown tells me “Bandsintown does not disclose unauthorized data to third parties and upon receiving an email from a researcher presenting a potential vulnerability in a script running on our ad platform, we quickly took the appropriate actions to resolve the issue in full.” Fiverr did not respond before press time. [Correction: Two companies listed by the researchers have confirmed via fraud prevention service Forter that they did not host any exploitative trackers, or that their trackers did not have access to Facebook data. They’ve been removed from the research paper and subsequently from this article.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-1619388 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/facebook-phone-app-api.png?w=680&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;361&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discovery of these data security flaws comes at a vulnerable time for Facebook. The company is trying to &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/zuckerberg-raw/&quot;&gt;recover from the Cambridge Analytica scandal&lt;/a&gt;, CEO Mark Zuckerberg just &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/zzzuckerberg/&quot;&gt;testified before congress&lt;/a&gt;, and today it &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/17/facebook-gdpr-changes/&quot;&gt;unveiled privacy updates&lt;/a&gt; to comply with Europe’s GDPR law. But Facebook’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/facebook-instagram-api-shut-down/&quot;&gt;recent API changes designed to safeguard user data&lt;/a&gt; didn’t prevent these exploits. And the situation shines more light on the little-understood ways Facebook users are tracked around the Internet, not just on its site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When a user grants a website access to their social media profile, they are not only &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/2018/03/17/facebook-how-to-turn-off-app-data-sharing/#mKFfGq.ACgqc&quot;&gt;trusting that website&lt;/a&gt;, but also third parties embedded on that site” writes Englehardt. This chart shows that what some trackers are pulling from users. Freedom To Tinker warned OnAudience about another security issue recently, leading it to stop collecting user info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-1624628 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/trackers.png?w=680&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;261&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook could have identified these trackers and prevented these exploits with sufficient API auditing. It’s currently ramping up API auditing as it hunts down other developers that might have improperly shared, sold, or used data like how Dr. Aleksandr Kogan’s app’s user data ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica. Facebook could also change its systems to prevent developers from taking an app-specific user ID and employing it to discover that person’s permanent overarching Facebook user ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelations like this are likely to beckon a bigger data backlash. Over the years, the public had became complacent about the ways their data was exploited without consent around the web. While it’s Facebook in the hot seat, other tech giants like Google rely on user data and operate developer platforms that can be tough to police. And news publishers, desperate to earn enough from ads to survive, often fall in with sketchy ad networks and trackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg makes an easy target because the Facebook founder is still the CEO, allowing critics and regulators to blame him for the social network’s failings. But any company playing fast and loose with user data should be sweating.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The ASUS Tinker Board is a compelling upgrade from a Raspberry Pi 3 B+</title>
<link>https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2018/asus-tinker-board-compelling-upgrade-raspberry-pi-3-b</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2018/asus-tinker-board-compelling-upgrade-raspberry-pi-3-b</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I've had a long history playing around with Raspberry Pis and other Single Board Computers (SBCs); from building a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pidramble.com&quot;&gt;cluster of Raspberry Pis to run Drupal&lt;/a&gt;, to building a &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.com/life/16/3/how-i-use-raspberry-pis-help-my-kids-sleep-better&quot;&gt;distributed home temperature monitoring system with Raspberry Pis&lt;/a&gt;, I've spent a good deal of time testing the limits of an SBC, and also finding ways to use their strengths to my advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/jeffgeerling.com/files/images/asus-tinker-board-sbc.jpg&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;446&quot; alt=&quot;ASUS Tinker Board SBC&quot; class=&quot;insert-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASUS sent me a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.asus.com/us/Single-Board-Computer/Tinker-Board/&quot;&gt;Tinker Board&lt;/a&gt; late last year, and unfortunately due to health reasons, I had to delay working on a review of this nice little SBC until now. In the mean time, the Raspberry Pi foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/&quot;&gt;released the Pi model 3 B+&lt;/a&gt;, which ups the ante and also negates a few of the advantages the more expensive Tinker Board had over the older model 3 B (not +). I just posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2018/raspberry-pi-3-b-review-and-performance-comparison&quot;&gt;comprehensive review of the Pi model 3 B+&lt;/a&gt;, and am now posting this review of the Tinker Board to compare and contrast it to the latest Pi offering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;40 pin header (color coded)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Power-Supply-Listed/dp/B07BC6WH7V/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=electronics&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1522789079&amp;amp;sr=1-3&amp;amp;keywords=raspberry+pi+3+b+&amp;amp;dpID=51IC7SDI3cL&amp;amp;preST=_SY300_QL70_&amp;amp;dpSrc=srch&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=mmjjg-20&amp;amp;linkId=c25d1019a84fcb38719a8e8de27daf28&quot;&gt;$35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Tinker-board-RK3288-1-8GHz-Mali-T764/dp/B06VSBVQWS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1522789055&amp;amp;sr=8-3&amp;amp;keywords=tinker+board&amp;amp;dpID=51XkGSoKSyL&amp;amp;preST=_SY300_QL70_&amp;amp;dpSrc=srch&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=mmjjg-20&amp;amp;linkId=ca68713345fa2c10eb2b08367f090e59&quot;&gt;$49.99&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm leaving out a lot of other specs that don't affect my day-to-day usage of an SBC, but what really stands out to me—and what may still make the Tinker Board worth the extra $15—is the slightly higher-clocked CPU and GPU, the faster onboard networking (which isn't crippled by being shared with the USB 2.0 bus like on the Pi), and double the RAM. The color-coded GPIO pins are a nice bonus, too, as I spend less time fumbling around counting pins on the Pi's unmarked header when experimenting with GPIO projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My initial impressions of the Tinker Board hardware are very good; the hardware is almost a perfect match to the layout of the Pi model 2 B, 3 B, and 3 B+—enough so that the Tinker Board fit in all my Pi cases. Note that the CPU seems to stand off &lt;em&gt;ever so slightly&lt;/em&gt; higher than the Pi's, so some cases with active cooling (e.g. a fan) might not fit the Tinker Board perfectly (one of my cases wouldn't clamp down all the way).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as with many other SBCs, the &lt;em&gt;software&lt;/em&gt; support is where the rubber meets the road, so let's dive in and see how things stack up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting started with the Tinker Board&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process for getting the OS onto a microSD card is exactly the same as the Raspberry Pi's Raspbian or most other SBCs (this is written for a Mac, but it's similar if you use Linux):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Download and expand the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.asus.com/us/Single-Board-Computer/Tinker-Board/#tinker-board-Download&quot;&gt;TinkerOS disk image&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insert a microSD card (I recommend the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Class-Micro-Adapter-MB-MC32DA/dp/B00WR4IJBE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=pc&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1467829489&amp;amp;sr=1-3&amp;amp;keywords=evo+&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=mmjjg-20&amp;amp;linkId=dbb3aff130ee0dede5197fca4c8fdb3f&quot;&gt;Samsung Evo+ 32GB&lt;/a&gt;), and unmount it: &lt;code&gt;diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2&lt;/code&gt; (use &lt;code&gt;diskutil list&lt;/code&gt; to find which disk it is; could be &lt;code&gt;/dev/disk3&lt;/code&gt; or something else).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write the disk image to the card: &lt;code&gt;pv YYYYMMDD-tinker-board-linaro-stretch-alip-vX.X.img.img | sudo dd of=/dev/rdisk2 bs=1m&lt;/code&gt; (I use &lt;code&gt;pv&lt;/code&gt; to track progress while the card is written).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eject the new &lt;code&gt;NO NAME&lt;/code&gt; disk that appears after the image is written.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insert the microSD card into the Asus Tinker Board, and boot it up!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am using the Debian-based OS (based on Debian 9 / Stretch), since that's the closest to Raspbian and has the best support and usability for general SBC usage and testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Debian flavor of TinkerOS is as close to bare bones Debian as you can get, and it boots right into the desktop (no need for a login) when you turn on the Tinker Board. If you plug in networking, it will automatically grab an IP address and join the network via DHCP, just like the Pi, and it has SSH enabled out of the box, so you can ssh into it with &lt;code&gt;ssh linaro@[tinker-board-ip-here]&lt;/code&gt; right away (I used &lt;code&gt;sudo fing&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fing.io/download-free-ip-scanner-desktop-linux-windows-osx/&quot;&gt;Fing&lt;/a&gt; to find out the IP address of the Tinker Board from my Mac, so I could do everything headless).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Networking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my experience with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2016/review-odroid-c2-compared-raspberry-pi-3-and-orange-pi-plus&quot;&gt;ODROID-C2 and Orange Pi&lt;/a&gt;—both of which clobbered the Raspberry Pi's wired networking performance—I was excited to see if the Tinker Board lived up to its promise of true 1 Gbps networking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/jeffgeerling.com/files/images/asus-tinker-board-onboard-lan-file-copy-benchmark.png&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;287&quot; alt=&quot;ASUS Tinker Board and Raspberry Pi model 3 B+ Benchmarks - Network Onboard LAN speeds&quot; class=&quot;insert-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For file copies, which involve both networking and reading/writing on the microSD card, the Tinker Board does a respectable job. Especially for the writes, where the Tinker Board's much improved microSD controller bandwidth shines, allowing speeds up to 3x faster than the Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/jeffgeerling.com/files/images/asus-tinker-board-iperf-lan-benchmark.png&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;218&quot; alt=&quot;ASUS Tinker Board and Raspberry Pi model 3 B+ Benchmarks - Network iperf Onboard LAN speeds&quot; class=&quot;insert-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of raw network performance, as measured by &lt;code&gt;iperf&lt;/code&gt;, there's no competition. The ASUS Tinker Board's dedicated gigabit LAN bandwidth allows it to saturate a gigabit Ethernet connection, and it's not shared with the USB bus, nor with the microSD bus, meaning all other operations can operate at full speed as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more benchmark details, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pidramble.com/wiki/benchmarks/networking&quot;&gt;Networking Benchmarks&lt;/a&gt; on the Raspberry Pi Dramble website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;microSD&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One performance metric that trips people up the first time they use an SBC is the slow performance of the main drive—the microSD card that runs the OS and impacts the performance of almost everything else on the system. MicroSD cards are not known for great performance in general computing tasks (which involve lots of small file reads and writes); they are usually optimized for reading or writing very large amounts of data as fast as possible, as they're most optimized for media recording devices and multiple-GB files. But the Raspberry Pi cripples the microSD performance even further, as you usually can't even sustain a large file read or write at more than 20 MB/second. Some of the microSD cards I've tested can hit 60 or more MB/second when I'm using them in my Mac with a USB 3.0 UHS-II SD card reader! So how does the ASUS Tinker Board compare?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/jeffgeerling.com/files/images/asus-tinker-board-microsd-card-performance-benchmarks-revision-2.png&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;325&quot; alt=&quot;ASUS Tinker Board and Raspberry Pi model 3 B+ Benchmarks - microSD card performance&quot; class=&quot;insert-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microSD controller in the Tinker Board is clearly operating at a much higher data rate than the one in the Pi; even with the SD overclock enabled on the Pi, it gets nowhere near the performance of the Tinker Board. The hdparm raw read throughput looks impressive, but isn't really a practical aid in measuring how the two devices would feel in real world scenarios. However, the 4k read and write benchmarks track much more realistic scenarios (e.g. when you're booting the SBC, or opening an app, compiling something, browsing the web, etc.), and even here, the ASUS Tinker Board is up to &lt;em&gt;35% faster than the Pi 3 B+&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microSD card I tested with is the fastest one I have benchmarked for SBC use (and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2018/raspberry-pi-microsd-card-performance-comparison-2018&quot;&gt;I have benchmarked them all!&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Class-Micro-Adapter-MB-MC32DA/dp/B00WR4IJBE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1524065343&amp;amp;sr=8-3&amp;amp;keywords=samsung+evo++32gb&amp;amp;dpID=419o58jbNhL&amp;amp;preST=_SX300_QL70_&amp;amp;dpSrc=srch&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=mmjjg-20&amp;amp;linkId=32d133adddfadea5bbec24d3485f555d&quot;&gt;Samsung's Evo+ 32GB microSD card&lt;/a&gt;. Highly recommended!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more benchmark details, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pidramble.com/wiki/benchmarks/microsd-cards&quot;&gt;microSD Card Benchmarks&lt;/a&gt; on the Raspberry Pi Dramble website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Power Consumption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing most SBCs do very well is conserve power; the mobile System-on-a-Chip (SoC) on which these computers are based is usually optimized for conserving power, especially when not doing intensive operations, because they're designed to operate primarily on battery power. Comparing the power consumption across different activities on the Pi and Tinker Board:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/jeffgeerling.com/files/images/asus-tinker-board-power-consumption-benchmarks.png&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;269&quot; alt=&quot;ASUS Tinker Board and Raspberry Pi model 3 B+ Benchmarks - Power consumption&quot; class=&quot;insert-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idle power consumption is neck-and-neck, and bodes well for the Tinker Board; as we'll see later, the higher CPU frequency and CPU performance gains more than justify the increased power consumption under load, but it's very good to see the idle power consumption matches (within a margin of error) the Pi 3 B+. This means the Tinker Board does a good job of sipping power normally, but can quickly ramp up to tackle a CPU-intensive task, with slightly better power-efficiency (all things considered) than the Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more benchmark details, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pidramble.com/wiki/benchmarks/power-consumption&quot;&gt;Power Consumption Benchmarks&lt;/a&gt; on the Raspberry Pi Dramble website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The importance of a good power supply&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as with Raspberry Pis, the Tinker Board needs a good, high-output power supply to be able to run at full capacity and consistently. Especially when under heavy load, the Tinker Board can pull more than 2A peak power, and your best bet is to get a good, dedicated power supply like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/NorthPada-Tinker-Supply-Charger-Adapter/dp/B072FTJH73/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1522790449&amp;amp;sr=8-3&amp;amp;keywords=tinker+board+power+supply&amp;amp;dpID=31-98pBGC6L&amp;amp;preST=_SX300_QL70_&amp;amp;dpSrc=srch&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=mmjjg-20&amp;amp;linkId=4df7c309c11bc7caf8da5df8132550e4&quot;&gt;NorthPada Tinker Board 5V 3A power supply&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CPU and Memory Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's see how the Pi and Tinker Board stack up when it comes to raw CPU and memory read/write performance, as measured by &lt;code&gt;sysbench&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/jeffgeerling.com/files/images/asus-tinker-board-sysbench-cpu-memory-benchmarks.png&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;249&quot; alt=&quot;ASUS Tinker Board and Raspberry Pi model 3 B+ Benchmarks - CPU and Memory speed&quot; class=&quot;insert-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the latest Pi 3 B+ CPU frequency increase, and the better thermal control from the new CPU package, the older Tinker Board's CPU soundly beats the Pi's by 25%. However, the memory performance is almost an inverse, as the Pi beats the Tinker Board by about 30% for both read and write operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In real-world usage, these numbers are much closer, but as we'll see in a minute, there are use cases where the overall system performance gives a thorough recommendation to the Tinker Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Drupal Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important benchmarks are real-world use cases. For something like logging temperature data, even the lowliest Pi Zero or Pi model A could handle it with aplomb. But for more advanced use cases, like using an SBC like the Tinker Board as a general purpose Debian workstation, or serving a website, the overall system performance has a huge impact on whether the computer feels fast or not. I do a lot of work with the Drupal open source Content Management System, so one of my best benchmarks is to install and run the latest version of Drupal, and run two tests: anonymous (cached) page loads, which test networking and memory access mostly; and authenticated (uncached) page loads, which tests CPU, database, and disk access:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/jeffgeerling.com/files/images/asus-tinker-board-drupal-benchmarks.png&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;254&quot; alt=&quot;ASUS Tinker Board and Raspberry Pi model 3 B+ Benchmarks - Drupal CMS page load performance&quot; class=&quot;insert-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anonymous benchmark ran 55% faster on the Tinker Board, and uncached page loads were 50% faster. It's interesting, because &lt;em&gt;individually&lt;/em&gt;, the microSD, CPU, and memory benchmarks don't show more than a 20-30% performance improvement over the Pi 3 B+. But if you put everything together in this real-world benchmark, there's a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; performance delta, completely in the Tinker Board's favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it feels to me like the A17 SoC on the ASUS Tinker Board is tuned a little better for peak performance than the Pi's A53 SoC, and even though there's a little higher peak energy consumption, the performance boost more than justifies it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7.6774193548387&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of a few slight differences in the default OS layout with TinkerOS vs Raspbian, I had to modify the way I installed Drupal and the LEMP stack using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/geerlingguy/drupal-pi&quot;&gt;Drupal Pi&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/geerlingguy/drupal-pi/issues/31&quot;&gt;make sure all the installation steps worked on the Tinker Board&lt;/a&gt;. After working through a few missing packages, everything seemed to run well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more benchmark details, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pidramble.com/wiki/benchmarks/drupal&quot;&gt;Drupal Benchmarks&lt;/a&gt; on the Raspberry Pi Dramble website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the end, I think the question most people would ask themselves is: is the ASUS Tinker Board worth $15 more than a Raspberry Pi model 3 B or model 3 B+? I'd say yes, if you answer the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You need the best performance out of an SBC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need more than 1 GB of RAM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want the slightly nicer setup experience, support, and fit-and-finish of the Tinker Board vs. other Pi clones (like Orange Pi, ODROID, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need fast networking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you didn't answer yes to one or more of those statements, I'd have a harder time recommending it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pi community is pretty diverse and has you covered for so many projects and use cases, whereas there's fewer developers and bloggers posting about experiences with the Tinker Board. So the community still has room for improvement, but it's a little nicer, in my limited experience, than that of the other SBCs I've used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pi is &lt;em&gt;fast enough&lt;/em&gt; for most use cases, and especially with the modest speed bumps in the model 3 B+ that put it almost on par with the Tinker Board in some uses, it makes it hard to justify the increased price of the Tinker Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the Tinker Board isn't right for you, it's worth watching ASUS and their next moves in this space. I like the design of the Tinker Board's colorful GPIO 100x more than the Pi, and their guides, forums, downloads, and support are pretty decent—as long as they keep them up to date. I'm really interested to see if ASUS will release a newer model in the next year that might go beyond where even the current Tinker Board is, performance-wise, as that would more than justify purchasing another one or two for me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What about the Tinker Board S?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, ASUS released a slightly improved version of the Tinker Board, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.asus.com/us/Single-Board-Computer/Tinker-Board-S/&quot;&gt;Tinker Board S&lt;/a&gt;. It includes 16 GB of onboard eMMC memory—much faster for general computing than a microSD card—for an extra $20 or so. There are a few other small differences, but the eMMC addition is the biggest improvement. For my use cases, the eMMC doesn't make a big enough difference to justify the cost, so I'm more interested in products in the $50 range and lower. Once an SBC approaches $100 or so, there are other options (like a used Intel core i5 desktop) which offer 10-100x the performance and infinite expansion options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's just me—I am okay with a larger footprint desktop computer for use cases which require more desktop-like disk, CPU, and memory performance. If you need that kind of performance in an SBC form factor, the S might be a good option too. The Tinker Board S should be available for sale starting on April 19, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Quest for the Next Billion-Dollar Color</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2018-quest-for-billion-dollar-red/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2018-quest-for-billion-dollar-red/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Subramanian is 64 and short, with a slight paunch and a dark mustache that curls down the sides of his mouth. Raised in Chennai, on the southeastern coast of India, he developed a fascination with the makeup of objects by examining beautiful seashells that had washed ashore. “How does nature make these things?” he would ask himself. It wasn’t until much later that he began asking how the shells got their colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically speaking, colors are the visual sensates of light as it’s bent or scattered or reflected off the atomic makeup of an object. Modern computers can display about 16.8 million of them, far more than people can see or printers can reproduce. To transform a digital or imagined color into something tangible requires a pigment. “Yes, you have this fabulous blue,” says Laurie Pressman, vice president of the Pantone Color Institute, which assists companies with color strategies for branding or products. “But wait, can I actually create the blue in velvet, silk, cotton, rayon, or coated paper stock?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not just the color,” she adds. “It’s the chemical composition of the color. And can that composition actually be realized in the material I’m going to apply it to?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the oven came a blue so radiant, so fantastic, it appeared almost extraterrestrial&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This limitation restricts the pool of pigments available to the garment, construction, tech, and other industries. A single one, titanium dioxide, accounts for almost two-thirds of the pigments produced globally; valued at about $13.2 billion, it’s responsible for the crisp whiteness of traffic lines, toothpaste, and powdered doughnuts. Getting other colors has historically meant incorporating dangerous inorganic elements or compounds, such as lead, cobalt, or even cyanide. In recent years, health and environmental regulations have created a heavy push toward more benign organic pigments, leading researchers to discover plenty of blacks, yellows, greens. Blue is a different story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sideImg left&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2018-quest-for-billion-dollar-red/img/FEATURE_RED_08-CMS.jpg&quot;/&gt;YInMn blue powder.
&lt;p&gt;PHOTOGRAPHER: IAN ALLEN FOR BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subramanian entered the annals of pigment lore even though he wasn’t looking for a pigment or even mixing ingredients thought capable of making a distinctive color. He and his co-investigators were after electronics—specifically a multiferroic, a material that’s both electrically and magnetically polarized, which is useful for computing. The yttrium began as pale white, the indium oxide black, and the manganese a bilious yellow. One of Subramanian’s postdoctoral students, Andrew Smith, ground them to gray, placed the blend in a small dish, and stuck it in a furnace heated to 2,200F. Twelve hours later, out of the oven came a deep, vibrant, intoxicating blue. It was so radiant, so fantastic, it appeared almost extraterrestrial—the ripest Venusian blueberry, cleaned, polished, and glowing from within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What the heck happened?” asked Subramanian when he saw it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I did exactly what you told me to do!” Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you sure you made the right one?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let’s try it again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subramanian knew a little something about discovery. After getting his doctorate in chemistry at the Indian Institute of Technology at Madras, he’d spent three decades researching solid-state materials chemistry at DuPont Co., essentially studying the composition of anything that wasn’t a liquid. He had 54 patents to his name, mostly involving superconductors, thermoelectric materials, and other esoterica compelling only to a narrow band of chemists concerned with electronics. Nothing colorful. But Subramanian could tell something was up with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He called some colleagues at the University of California at Santa Barbara. “You’ve got to see this to believe it,” he said. They didn’t share his extracurricular fascination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;colImg&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2018-quest-for-billion-dollar-red/img/1818P_FEATURE_RED_01.jpg&quot;/&gt;Different concentrations of manganese lead to different saturations and densities of the color.
&lt;p&gt;PHOTOGRAPHER: IAN ALLEN FOR BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’d never seen a color like that in my life,” he recalls. “I’ve made so many oxides. Superconductors are always black or brown or sometimes yellow. Never made this.” It was as though he’d crossbred tomatoes with onions and sprouted a cantaloupe. “I was always worried, is this true? Am I dreaming?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue is one of nature’s most abundant tones, but it’s proved hard for human hands to create. When the ancient Egyptians tried to replicate the deep, oceanic tone of ultramarine to adorn tombs, papyrus, and art, they wound up with something more like turquoise. During the Renaissance, ultramarine could be costlier than gold, because the lapis lazuli from which it derives was mined in remote Afghanistan. (Michelangelo nevertheless scored some for the Sistine Chapel ceiling.) The first modern synthetic pigment, Prussian blue, or ferric ferrocyanide, wasn’t discovered until the early 18th century, by a German chemist trying to make red. Since then, many common blues (cerulean, midnight, aquamarine, smalt) have contained traces of cobalt, a suspected carcinogen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subramanian and Smith began testing their compound by dunking it into acid; they were pleased to find it didn’t dissolve. YInMn also proved to be inert, unfading, and nontoxic. It was more durable than ultramarine and Prussian blue, safer than cobalt blue, lighter than phthalocyanine blue, darker than Victoria blue. It was remarkably heat-reflecting, potentially allowing whatever object it coated to remain cool under the sun. Subramanian started keeping two wooden birdhouses positioned beneath a pair of heated lamps on a table in his office. One of the roofs was painted with equal parts black chromium oxide and cobalt blue; the other was black mixed with YInMn blue. The YInMn house stayed around 55 degrees cooler than its counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subramanian wrote a paper describing his blue’s properties, eventually publishing it in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/em&gt;, and filed for a patent (No. 8,282,728, issued in October 2012 to Subramanian, Smith, and a colleague). Word that he’d fathered some sort of new blue generated media attention—and corporate suitors in turn. Subramanian was surprised by the interest and quickly applied for more government funding. “I thought everything was known about this,” he says. “Who was going to give me money to do research on pigments?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;colImg&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2018-quest-for-billion-dollar-red/img/FEATURE_RED_03.jpg&quot;/&gt;Mixing together yttrium, indium, and manganese to make YInMn.
&lt;p&gt;PHOTOGRAPHER: IAN ALLEN FOR BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was more at stake than he initially grasped. The research company Ceresana estimates that pigments are a $30 billion industry, headlined by major chemical companies such as Lanxess, BASF, Venator (a spinoff from Huntsman), and Chemours (a spinoff from DuPont). High-performance pigments—the most colorful, stable, and durable ones—are a rapidly growing market segment, accounting for almost a sixth of the total value in 2016, according to Smithers Rapra Ltd. Demand is rising as lead-based pigments are phased out and emerging markets put high-performance ones in industrial and building coatings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A safe, durable, environmentally friendly blue ought to be enormously lucrative. It’s overwhelmingly America’s favorite color, according to Pressman of the Pantone Color Institute. “Blue is that concept of hope, promise, dependability, stability, calm, and cool,” she says. “We think of it as a color of constancy and truth. It’s one of the most approachable colors, the color that’s the most comfortable.” Blue is central to the brand imaging of ﻿Ikea, Ford, Walmart, and Facebook. It’s on our refrigerator shelves, our walls, our clothes. Two-thirds of Major League Baseball teams feature blue on their uniforms. Blue is everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companies calling Subramanian had plenty of ideas for YInMn. HP wanted to know if the pigment could be converted to an ink. Chanel was interested in it for cosmetics. Merck wondered about skin care. Nike was curious whether it could be used in sneaker leather to keep feet cool. Subcontractors to companies working on self-driving cars thought YInMn’s reflective properties might improve the vehicles’ sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pigment sellers were interested, too. Shepherd Color Co. sent representatives to Oregon State within a week of the paper’s publication, then spent two years testing YInMn for environmental resilience, regulatory fitness, and cost. The next step was licensing. The patent belonged to Subramanian, but Oregon State was entitled to split the royalties because the discovery had occurred in a university-owned laboratory. Shepherd won the exclusive license in 2015 and began preparing to produce half-ton batches for what it decided was the most viable market: industrial coatings for sidings and roofs. (The company declined to disclose the terms of the deal.) Last September, eight years after Subramanian’s discovery, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency finally approved YInMn for commercial sale in industrial coatings and plastics. Shepherd swiftly went to market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sideImg right&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2018-quest-for-billion-dollar-red/img/FEATURE_RED_07-CMS.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;PHOTOGRAPHER: IAN ALLEN FOR BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A natural next step would be for Shepherd to submit an application to be listed on the EPA’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2018-quest-for-billion-dollar-red/noreferrer%20noopener&quot;&gt;Toxic Substances Control Act inventory&lt;/a&gt;, which would approve it for all applications—potentially including some of the ones in which Nike et al were interested. But Shepherd has yet to apply. So far, YInMn’s only other forays into the market have been from Crayola LLC, whose first new crayon in a decade, Bluetiful, was purportedly “inspired” by YInMn—Shepherd wouldn’t comment on whether the company is paying royalties—and Derivan, the Australian paint maker, which has transformed the pigment into an acrylic that’s being offered to artists at a handful of retailers, on a sample basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early market for Shepherd has been limited somewhat by its high price, a function of the cost of indium, a metal primarily used in the clear, thin, conductive layer of smartphone touchscreens. For this purpose it needs to be exceptionally pure, which, coupled with high demand, meant it was selling for $720 per kilogram at the end of 2017. (The figure for manganese was $1.74.) As a result, Shepherd lists YInMn blue at $1,000 per kilogram, by far its most expensive pigment. Ryan, Shepherd’s marketing manager, jokes that unless an indium meteor crashes into southwestern Ohio, the price will remain high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean it can’t generate a lot of money. Geoffrey Peake, R&amp;amp;D manager at Shepherd, says YInMn and others in its class, complex inorganic colored pigments, are the company’s most durable offerings. As paint coatings, they can come with a warranty of up to 50 years—well worth the investment for metal roofing or skyscraper facades. Other applications, and lower prices, will have to wait until researchers at Shepherd or Oregon State can replace the indium without dulling the blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slow pace of testing and regulatory approval, plus attorney fees and other licensing expenses, has meant that, almost nine years after his discovery, Subramanian still hasn’t seen any royalties. Still, YInMn has rejuvenated his career and given it new direction. “If we can create a beautiful red pigment, which is stable and nontoxic, it’s going to be a big hit,” he says. “That’s what I’m hoping.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Machine Learning’s ‘Amazing’ Ability to Predict Chaos</title>
<link>https://www.quantamagazine.org/machine-learnings-amazing-ability-to-predict-chaos-20180418/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.quantamagazine.org/machine-learnings-amazing-ability-to-predict-chaos-20180418/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Half a century ago, the pioneers of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/chaos-theory/&quot;&gt;chaos theory&lt;/a&gt; discovered that the “butterfly effect” makes long-term prediction impossible. Even the smallest perturbation to a complex system (like the weather, the economy or just about anything else) can touch off a concatenation of events that leads to a dramatically divergent future. Unable to pin down the state of these systems precisely enough to predict how they’ll play out, we live under a veil of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now the robots are here to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a series of results reported in the journals &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.024102&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physical Review Letters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07313&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chaos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, scientists have used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/machine-learning/&quot;&gt;machine learning&lt;/a&gt; — the same computational technique behind recent successes in artificial intelligence — to predict the future evolution of chaotic systems out to stunningly distant horizons. The approach is being lauded by outside experts as groundbreaking and likely to find wide application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I find it really amazing how far into the future they predict” a system’s chaotic evolution, said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jacobs-university.de/directory/hjaeger&quot;&gt;Herbert Jaeger&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of computational science at Jacobs University in Bremen, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings come from veteran chaos theorist &lt;a href=&quot;https://umdphysics.umd.edu/people/faculty/current/item/380-edott.html&quot;&gt;Edward Ott&lt;/a&gt; and four collaborators at the University of Maryland. They employed a machine-learning algorithm called reservoir computing to “learn” the dynamics of an archetypal chaotic system called the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. The evolving solution to this equation behaves like a flame front, flickering as it advances through a combustible medium. The equation also describes drift waves in plasmas and other phenomena, and serves as “a test bed for studying turbulence and spatiotemporal chaos,” said &lt;a href=&quot;https://ireap.umd.edu/staff/grad/pathak&quot;&gt;Jaideep Pathak&lt;/a&gt;, Ott’s graduate student and the lead author of the new papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After training itself on data from the past evolution of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, the researchers’ reservoir computer could then closely predict how the flamelike system would continue to evolve out to eight “Lyapunov times” into the future, eight times further ahead than previous methods allowed, loosely speaking. The Lyapunov time represents how long it takes for two almost-identical states of a chaotic system to exponentially diverge. As such, it typically sets the horizon of predictability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is really very good,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pks.mpg.de/~kantz/&quot;&gt;Holger Kantz&lt;/a&gt;, a chaos theorist at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden, Germany, said of the eight-Lyapunov-time prediction. “The machine-learning technique is almost as good as knowing the truth, so to say.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The algorithm knows nothing about the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation itself; it only sees data recorded about the evolving solution to the equation. This makes the machine-learning approach powerful; in many cases, the equations describing a chaotic system aren’t known, crippling dynamicists’ efforts to model and predict them. Ott and company’s results suggest you don’t need the equations — only data. “This paper suggests that one day we might be able perhaps to predict weather by machine-learning algorithms and not by sophisticated models of the atmosphere,” Kantz said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides weather forecasting, experts say the machine-learning technique could help with monitoring cardiac arrhythmias for signs of impending heart attacks and monitoring neuronal firing patterns in the brain for signs of neuron spikes. More speculatively, it might also help with predicting rogue waves, which endanger ships, and possibly even earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ott particularly hopes the new tools will prove useful for giving advance warning of solar storms, like the one that erupted across 35,000 miles of the sun’s surface in 1859. That magnetic outburst created aurora borealis visible all around the Earth and blew out some telegraph systems, while generating enough voltage to allow other lines to operate with their power switched off. If such a solar storm lashed the planet unexpectedly today, experts say it would severely damage Earth’s electronic infrastructure. “If you knew the storm was coming, you could just turn off the power and turn it back on later,” Ott said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He, Pathak and their colleagues &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chaos.umd.edu/~bhunt/&quot;&gt;Brian Hunt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.networks.umd.edu/&quot;&gt;Michelle Girvan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/view/zhixin-lu-site&quot;&gt;Zhixin Lu&lt;/a&gt; (who is now at the University of Pennsylvania) achieved their results by synthesizing existing tools. Six or seven years ago, when the powerful algorithm known as “deep learning” was starting to master AI tasks like image and speech recognition, they started reading up on machine learning and thinking of clever ways to apply it to chaos. They learned of a handful of promising results predating the deep-learning revolution. Most importantly, in the early 2000s, Jaeger and fellow German chaos theorist Harald Haas &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.columbia.edu/cu/biology/courses/w4070/Reading_List_Yuste/haas_04.pdf&quot;&gt;made use&lt;/a&gt; of a network of randomly connected artificial neurons — which form the “reservoir” in reservoir computing — to learn the dynamics of three chaotically coevolving variables. After training on the three series of numbers, the network could predict the future values of the three variables out to an impressively distant horizon. However, when there were more than a few interacting variables, the computations became impossibly unwieldy. Ott and his colleagues needed a more efficient scheme to make reservoir computing relevant for large chaotic systems, which have huge numbers of interrelated variables. Every position along the front of an advancing flame, for example, has velocity components in three spatial directions to keep track of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took years to strike upon the straightforward solution. “What we exploited was the locality of the interactions” in spatially extended chaotic systems, Pathak said. Locality means variables in one place are influenced by variables at nearby places but not by places far away. “By using that,” Pathak explained, “we can essentially break up the problem into chunks.” That is, you can parallelize the problem, using one reservoir of neurons to learn about one patch of a system, another reservoir to learn about the next patch, and so on, with slight overlaps of neighboring domains to account for their interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parallelization allows the reservoir computing approach to handle chaotic systems of almost any size, as long as proportionate computer resources are dedicated to the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ott explained reservoir computing as a three-step procedure. Say you want to use it to predict the evolution of a spreading fire. First, you measure the height of the flame at five different points along the flame front, continuing to measure the height at these points on the front as the flickering flame advances over a period of time. You feed these data-streams in to randomly chosen artificial neurons in the reservoir. The input data triggers the neurons to fire, triggering connected neurons in turn and sending a cascade of signals throughout the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second step is to make the neural network learn the dynamics of the evolving flame front from the input data. To do this, as you feed data in, you also monitor the signal strengths of several randomly chosen neurons in the reservoir. Weighting and combining these signals in five different ways produces five numbers as outputs. The goal is to adjust the weights of the various signals that go into calculating the outputs until those outputs consistently match the next set of inputs — the five new heights measured a moment later along the flame front. “What you want is that the output should be the input at a slightly later time,” Ott explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn the correct weights, the algorithm simply compares each set of outputs, or predicted flame heights at each of the five points, to the next set of inputs, or actual flame heights, increasing or decreasing the weights of the various signals each time in whichever way would have made their combinations give the correct values for the five outputs. From one time-step to the next, as the weights are tuned, the predictions gradually improve, until the algorithm is consistently able to predict the flame’s state one time-step later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the third step, you actually do the prediction,” Ott said. The reservoir, having learned the system’s dynamics, can reveal how it will evolve. The network essentially asks itself what will happen. Outputs are fed back in as the new inputs, whose outputs are fed back in as inputs, and so on, making a projection of how the heights at the five positions on the flame front will evolve. Other reservoirs working in parallel predict the evolution of height elsewhere in the flame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a plot in their &lt;em&gt;PRL&lt;/em&gt; paper, which appeared in January, the researchers show that their predicted flamelike solution to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation exactly matches the true solution out to eight Lyapunov times before chaos finally wins, and the actual and predicted states of the system diverge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual approach to predicting a chaotic system is to measure its conditions at one moment as accurately as possible, use these data to calibrate a physical model, and then evolve the model forward. As a ballpark estimate, you’d have to measure a typical system’s initial conditions 100,000,000 times more accurately to predict its future evolution eight times further ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why machine learning is “a very useful and powerful approach,” said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/105320.html&quot;&gt;Ulrich Parlitz&lt;/a&gt; of the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization in Göttingen, Germany, who, like Jaeger, also applied machine learning to low-dimensional chaotic systems in the early 2000s. “I think it’s not only working in the example they present but is universal in some sense and can be applied to many processes and systems.” In a paper soon to be published in &lt;em&gt;Chaos&lt;/em&gt;, Parlitz and a collaborator applied reservoir computing to predict the dynamics of “excitable media,” such as cardiac tissue. Parlitz suspects that deep learning, while being more complicated and computationally intensive than reservoir computing, will also work well for tackling chaos, as will other machine-learning algorithms. Recently, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and ETH Zurich &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03365&quot;&gt;achieved similar results&lt;/a&gt; as the Maryland team using a “long short-term memory” neural network, which has recurrent loops that enable it to store temporary information for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the work in their &lt;em&gt;PRL&lt;/em&gt; paper, Ott, Pathak, Girvan, Lu and other collaborators have come closer to a practical implementation of their prediction technique. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04779.pdf&quot;&gt;new research accepted for publication in &lt;em&gt;Chaos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they showed that improved predictions of chaotic systems like the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation become possible by hybridizing the data-driven, machine-learning approach and traditional model-based prediction. Ott sees this as a more likely avenue for improving weather prediction and similar efforts, since we don’t always have complete high-resolution data or perfect physical models. “What we should do is use the good knowledge that we have where we have it,” he said, “and if we have ignorance we should use the machine learning to fill in the gaps where the ignorance resides.” The reservoir’s predictions can essentially calibrate the models; in the case of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, accurate predictions are extended out to 12 Lyapunov times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The duration of a Lyapunov time varies for different systems, from milliseconds to millions of years. (It’s a few days in the case of the weather.) The shorter it is, the touchier or more prone to the butterfly effect a system is, with similar states departing more rapidly for disparate futures. Chaotic systems are everywhere in nature, going haywire more or less quickly. Yet strangely, chaos itself is hard to pin down. “It’s a term that most people in dynamical systems use, but they kind of hold their noses while using it,” said &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.uchicago.edu/~wilkinso/&quot;&gt;Amie Wilkinson&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of mathematics at the University of Chicago. “You feel a bit cheesy for saying something is chaotic,” she said, because it grabs people’s attention while having no agreed-upon mathematical definition or necessary and sufficient conditions. “There is no easy concept,” Kantz agreed. In some cases, tuning a single parameter of a system can make it go from chaotic to stable or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilkinson and Kantz both define chaos in terms of stretching and folding, much like the repeated stretching and folding of dough in the making of puff pastries. Each patch of dough stretches horizontally under the rolling pin, separating exponentially quickly in two spatial directions. Then the dough is folded and flattened, compressing nearby patches in the vertical direction. The weather, wildfires, the stormy surface of the sun and all other chaotic systems act just this way, Kantz said. “In order to have this exponential divergence of trajectories you need this stretching, and in order not to run away to infinity you need some folding,” where folding comes from nonlinear relationships between variables in the systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stretching and compressing in the different dimensions correspond to a system’s positive and negative “Lyapunov exponents,” respectively. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5010300?journalCode=cha&quot;&gt;another recent paper in &lt;em&gt;Chaos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; the Maryland team reported that their reservoir computer could successfully learn the values of these characterizing exponents from data about a system’s evolution. Exactly why reservoir computing is so good at learning the dynamics of chaotic systems is not yet well understood, beyond the idea that the computer tunes its own formulas in response to data until the formulas replicate the system’s dynamics. The technique works so well, in fact, that Ott and some of the other Maryland researchers now intend to use chaos theory as a way to better understand the internal machinations of neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>California Opens Investigation into Tesla Workplace Conditions</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-18/california-opens-investigation-into-tesla-workplace-conditions</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-18/california-opens-investigation-into-tesla-workplace-conditions</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;California’s Division of Occupational Safety and Health has opened an investigation into &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;Tesla Inc.&lt;/a&gt; following a report about worker protections at the company’s lone auto plant in Fremont, California.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The state agency “takes seriously reports of workplace hazards and allegations of employers’ underreporting recordable work-related injuries and illnesses” and “currently has an open inspection at Tesla,” said Erika Monterroza, a spokeswoman for the state’s industrial relations department.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;California requires employers to maintain what are called &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/calosha-updates/log300-reporting.html&quot; title=&quot;California site on Log 300 records&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Log 300 records&lt;/a&gt; of injuries and illnesses. Monterroza said that while the state doesn’t disclose details of open inspections, they typically include a review of employers’ Log 300 records and checks to ensure that serious injuries are reported within eight hours as required by law.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/article/tesla-says-its-factory-is-safer-but-it-left-injuries-off-the-books/&quot; title=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/article/tesla-says-its-factory-is-safer-but-it-left-injuries-off-the-books/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; this week by the Center for Investigative Reporting’s Reveal alleged that Tesla failed to report serious injuries on legally mandated reports, making its numbers appear better than they actually were. The website cited former members of Tesla’s environment, health and safety team saying Chief Executive Officer &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1954518&quot; title=&quot;Billionaire Profile&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;’s personal preferences were often invoked as reason not to address potential hazards.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Tesla’s Pushback&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla pushed back against the story in a &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/blog/not-so-revealing-story&quot; title=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/blog/not-so-revealing-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;lengthy blog post&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, calling it “an ideologically motivated attack by an extremist organization working directly with union supporters to create a calculated disinformation campaign against Tesla.” The United Auto Workers union has been trying to organize Fremont workers for &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-09/tesla-employee-says-workers-contacted-uaw-about-organizing-plant&quot; title=&quot;Tesla Workers Contact UAW to Unionize Musk’s Lone Auto Plant (2)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;more than a year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In responding to news of California’s investigation, Tesla said in an emailed statement Wednesday that the injury rate at Fremont was lower than when Toyota Motor Corp. and then-General Motors Corp. operated the factory with UAW-represented workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We care deeply about the safety and well-being of our people and strive to do better every day,” the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California’s Division of Occupational Safety and Health, known as CAL/OSHA, opened its inspection late Tuesday. Investigations can be triggered by a number of reasons, including internal complaints from employees. The agency declined to say what triggered its latest probe, which could take as long as six months to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Full Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Cal-OSHA is required to investigate any claims that are made, regardless of whether they have merit or are baseless (as we believe these are), and we always provide our full cooperation,” Tesla said in its statement. The agency investigated the company’s injury reporting and record-keeping last year and closed it without finding any violations or taking further action, according to the carmaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cal/OSHA’s regulations define a serious injury or illness as one that requires employee hospitalization for more than 24 hours for a matter other than medical observation, or one in which part of the body is lost or permanent disfigurement occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have never in the entire history of our company received a violation for inaccurate or incomplete injury record-keeping,” the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Worker Stories&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reveal investigation followed a February &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/carolineodonovan/tesla-fremont-factory-injuries?utm_term=.rtGlm8g3X#.aabqBK2dz&quot; title=&quot;Buzzfeed story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; by Buzzfeed in which former Tesla workers alleged that production pressure and failures to sufficiently rotate employees’ tasks spurred serious injuries. In May 2017, the Guardian &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/18/tesla-workers-factory-conditions-elon-musk&quot; title=&quot;Guardian story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Tesla managers pressed employees to work through pain and belittled safety complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk told the Guardian in a phone interview that he had placed his own desk in “the most painful place” in the Fremont factory and noted that Tesla was losing money. “This is not some situation where, for example, we are just greedy capitalists who decided to skimp on safety in order to have more profits and dividends and that kind of thing. It’s just a question of how much money we lose. And how do we survive? How do we not die and have everyone lose their jobs?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tesla is at a critical juncture in terms of both production and financial pressures. In an internal email, Musk announced this week that Fremont would move to a &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-17/tesla-moves-to-24-7-model-3-production-to-hit-6-000-a-week-goal&quot; title=&quot;Tesla Shifts Model 3 to 24/7 Production as Musk Hikes Output&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;24/7 schedule&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to produce 6,000 Model 3 sedans a week by the end of June. He tweeted last week that the company had &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-13/musk-tips-his-tesla-cap-to-humans-after-robots-undercut-model-3&quot; title=&quot;Musk Tips Tesla Cap to Humans After Robots Undercut Model 3 (1)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;over-relied on automation&lt;/a&gt; and is now on a hiring spree, seeking to add hundreds of workers to a factory that already employs roughly 10,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News has spoken with several people who’ve worked at Fremont who say that Tesla’s push to work long hours and its unresponsiveness to worker concerns have contributed to an unsafe environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re still 100 percent just about production,” said Dennis Duran, a pro-union employee who works in the Fremont paint shop. He said he’s complained to management that “if the line goes down, I see 20 maintenance guys trying to get it up and running. I don’t see that priority with health and safety.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>No boundaries for Facebook data: third-party trackers abuse Facebook Login</title>
<link>https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2018/04/18/no-boundaries-for-facebook-data-third-party-trackers-abuse-facebook-login/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2018/04/18/no-boundaries-for-facebook-data-third-party-trackers-abuse-facebook-login/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Steven Englehardt [0], Gunes Acar, and Arvind Narayanan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far in the &lt;em&gt;No boundaries&lt;/em&gt; series, we’ve uncovered how web trackers exfiltrate identifying information from &lt;a href=&quot;https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2017/11/15/no-boundaries-exfiltration-of-personal-data-by-session-replay-scripts/&quot;&gt;web pages&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2017/12/27/no-boundaries-for-user-identities-web-trackers-exploit-browser-login-managers/&quot;&gt;browser password managers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2018/02/26/no-boundaries-for-credentials-password-leaks-to-mixpanel-and-session-replay-companies/&quot;&gt;form inputs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we report yet another type of surreptitious data collection by third-party scripts that we discovered: the exfiltration of personal identifiers from websites through “login with Facebook” and other such social login APIs. Specifically, we found two types of vulnerabilities [1]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;seven third parties abuse websites’ access to Facebook user data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one third party uses its own Facebook “application” to track users around the web.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Vulnerability 1: Third parties piggyback on Facebook access granted to websites&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;vuln1&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/ftt-uploads/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/17235951/third_party_exfiltration.png&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram of third-party script accessing Facebook API&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;When a user clicks “Login with Facebook”, they will be prompted to allow the website they’re visiting to access some of their Facebook profile information [2]. Even after Facebook’s recent moves to lock down the feature, websites can request the user’s email address and  “public profile” (name, age range, gender, locale, and profile photo) without triggering a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/review/what-is-login-review&quot;&gt;manual review by Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. Once the user allows access, any third-party Javascript embedded in the page, such as tracker.com in the figure above, can also retrieve the user’s Facebook information as if they were the first party [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;more-14002&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Login and other social login systems simplify the account creation process for users by decreasing the number of passwords to remember. But social login brings risks: Cambridge Analytica was found misusing user data collected by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2018/3/17/17134072/facebook-cambridge-analytica-trump-explained-user-data&quot;&gt;Facebook quiz app which used the Login with Facebook&lt;/a&gt; feature. We’ve uncovered an additional risk: when a user grants a website access to their social media profile, they are not only &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/2018/03/17/facebook-how-to-turn-off-app-data-sharing/#mKFfGq.ACgqc&quot;&gt;trusting that website&lt;/a&gt;, but also third parties embedded on that site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found seven scripts collecting Facebook user data using the first party’s Facebook access [4]. These scripts are embedded on a total of &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/englehardt/bf976e6b90f44f735749014a7a4a48b6&quot;&gt;434 of the top 1 million sites&lt;/a&gt; (UPDATE: see clarification below). We detail how we discovered these scripts in Appendix 1 below. Most of them grab the user ID, and two grab additional profile information such as email and username. We believe the websites embedding these scripts are likely unaware of this particular data access [5].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user ID collected through the Facebook API is specific to the website (or the “application” in Facebook’s terminology), which would limit the potential for cross-site tracking. But these app-scoped user IDs can be used to retrieve the global Facebook ID, user’s profile photo, and other public profile information, which can be used to identify and track users across websites and devices [6].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* OnAudience stopped collecting this information after we released the results of a previous study in the No Boundaries series, which showed them abusing browser autofill to &lt;a href=&quot;https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2017/12/27/no-boundaries-for-user-identities-web-trackers-exploit-browser-login-managers/&quot;&gt;collect user email addresses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;^ Although we observe these scripts query the Facebook API and save the user’s Facebook ID, we could not verify that it is sent to their server due to obfuscation of their code and some limitations of our measurement methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/ftt-uploads/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/16235035/facebook_api_access_code_sample.png&quot; alt=&quot;Code sample from OpenTag script that exfiltrates to Lytics&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;It is straightforward for a third party script to grab data from the Facebook API. The code snippet above is from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/englehardt/4097d627e11b140892f6bde3f84f3e42&quot;&gt;OpenTag script&lt;/a&gt; that exfiltrates the user’s Facebook ID to Lytics, a personalized Marketing and Customer Data Platform. We’ve added comments and made minor simplifications for clarity; the original script is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/englehardt/4097d627e11b140892f6bde3f84f3e42&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The script continually checks for the existence of the Facebook API (available via window.FB). Once the user logs in to Facebook, the tracking script can silently query the user’s login status. The response to the login status query contains the user’s Facebook ID. The script then parses the ID out of the response and sends it back to their server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we can’t say how these trackers use the information they collect, we can examine their marketing material to understand how it may be used. &lt;a href=&quot;http://onaudience.com/&quot;&gt;OnAudience&lt;/a&gt;, Tealium &lt;a href=&quot;https://tealium.com/products/audiencestream/&quot;&gt;AudienceStream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.getlytics.com/&quot;&gt;Lytics&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://props.id/&quot;&gt;ProPS&lt;/a&gt; all offer some form of “customer data platform”, which collect data to help publishers to better monetize their users. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forter.com/&quot;&gt;Forter&lt;/a&gt; offers “identity-based fraud prevention” for e-commerce sites. &lt;a href=&quot;http://augur.io&quot;&gt;Augur&lt;/a&gt; offers cross-device tracking and consumer recognition services. We were unable to determine the company which owns the ntvk1.ru domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Vulnerability 2: Tracking users around the web with the Facebook Login service&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some third parties use the Facebook Login feature to authenticate users across many websites: &lt;a href=&quot;https://disqus.com/&quot;&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt;, a commenting widget, is a popular example. However, hidden third-party trackers can also use Facebook Login to deanonymize users for targeted advertising. This is a privacy violation, as it is unexpected and users are unaware of it. But how can a hidden tracker get the user to Login with Facebook? When the same tracker is also a first party that users visit directly. This is exactly what we found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bandsintown.com/&quot;&gt;Bandsintown&lt;/a&gt; doing. Worse, they did so in a way that allowed any malicious site to embed Bandsintown’s iframe  to identify its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/ftt-uploads/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/18000001/third_party_identification.png&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram of third-party script identifying users with the Facebook API&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;470&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Top panel:&lt;/em&gt; Bandsintown’s website (represented as &lt;em&gt;tracker.com&lt;/em&gt;) allows visitors to learn about local concerts and follow artists they might be interested in. To follow an artist, users are required to Login with Facebook and give the Bandsintown Facebook app access to their profile, city, likes, email address, and music activity. At this point Bandsintown has access to the necessary authentication tokens to access Facebook account information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bottom panel:&lt;/em&gt; Bandsintown offers an advertising service called “Amplified”, which is present on many of the top music-related sites including lyrics.com, songlyrics.com and lyricsmania.com. When a Bandsintown user browses to a website that embeds Bandsintown’s Amplified advertising product, the advertising script embeds an invisible iframe which connects to Bandsintown’s Facebook application using the authentication tokens established earlier, and grabs the user’s Facebook ID. The iframe then passes the user ID back to the embedding script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discovered that the iframe injected by Bandsintown would pass the user’s information to the embedding script indiscriminately. Thus, any malicious site could have used their iframe to identify visitors. We informed Bandsintown of this vulnerability and they confirmed that it is now fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This unintended exposure of Facebook data to third parties is not due to a bug in Facebook’s Login feature. Rather, it is due to the lack of security boundaries between the first-party and third-party scripts in today’s web. Still, there are steps Facebook and other social login providers can take to prevent abuse: API use can be audited to review how, where, and which parties are accessing social login data. Facebook could also disallow the lookup of profile picture and global Facebook IDs by app-scoped user IDs. It might also be the right time to make &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2014/04/f8-introducing-anonymous-login-and-an-updated-facebook-login/&quot;&gt;Anonymous Login with Facebook&lt;/a&gt; available following its announcement four years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarification (2018-04-19 2:25am):&lt;/strong&gt; In a previous version of the post we listed three sites (fiverr.com, bhphotovideo.com, and mongodb.com) which embed scripts that match the URL patterns given above. Third-party scripts may contain different contents when loaded by different sites, even though the scripts are served from same or similar URLs. We confirmed that the Forter scripts embedded on fiverr.com and bhphotovideo.com do NOT include functionality to access Facebook data. On mongodb.com we only observed the presence of an Augur script. We have published an &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/englehardt/bf976e6b90f44f735749014a7a4a48b6&quot;&gt;updated list of sites&lt;/a&gt;, marking the ones where we have confirmed the presence of functionality to access Facebook data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;[0] Steven Englehardt is currently working at Mozilla as a Privacy Engineer. He coauthored this post in his Princeton capacity, and this post doesn’t necessarily represent Mozilla’s views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] We use the term “vulnerability” to refer to weaknesses arising from insecure design practices on today’s web, rather than its commonly understood sense in computer security of weaknesses arising due to software bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2] In this post we focus on websites which use Facebook Login, but the vulnerabilities we describe are likely to exist for most social login providers and on mobile devices. Indeed, we found scripts that appear to grab user identifiers from &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/englehardt/9801bef634dc29699116a489f33d850b&quot;&gt;the Google Plus API&lt;/a&gt; and from the Russian &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/englehardt/65d2959be03bfafdc1c25d57965f4539&quot;&gt;social media site VK&lt;/a&gt; , but we limited our investigation to Facebook Login as it’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.builtwith.com/javascript&quot;&gt;most widely used social SDK on the web&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3] When the user completes the Facebook login procedure on a website that uses Facebook’s Javascript SDK, the SDK stores an authentication token in the page. When the user navigates to a new page, the SDK automatically reestablishes the authentication token using the browser’s Facebook cookies. All third-party queries to the SDK automatically use this token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4] In order to better understand the level of integration a third party has with the first party, we categorize scripts based on their use of the first party’s Application ID (or AppId), which is provided to Facebook during the login initialization phase to identify the site. Inclusion of a site’s application ID and initialization code in the third-party library suggests a tighter integration—the first party was likely required to configure the third-party script to access the Facebook SDK on their behalf. While application IDs aren’t meant to be secrets, we take the lack of an App ID to imply loose integration—the first party may not be aware of the access. In fact, all of the scripts in this category take the same actions when embedded on a simple test page with no prior business relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]. The following could indicate the first party’s awareness of the Facebook data access:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) third-party initiates the Facebook login process instead of passively waiting for the login to happen; 2) third-party includes the unique App ID of the website it is embedded on. The seven scripts listed above neither initiate the login process, nor contain the app ID of the websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it is very hard to be certain about the exact relationship between the first parties and third parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  The &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/identity/id-matching&quot;&gt;application-scoped&lt;/a&gt; IDs can be resolved to real user profile information by &lt;a href=&quot;https://snarfed.org/2015-10-25_de-anonymizing-facebooks-app-scoped-ids&quot;&gt;querying Facebook’s Graph API&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/user/picture/&quot;&gt;retrieve the user’s profile photo&lt;/a&gt; (which does not even require authentication!). When security researchers showed that it is possible to map app-scoped IDs to Facebook IDs and download profile pictures &lt;a href=&quot;https://snarfed.org/2015-10-25_de-anonymizing-facebooks-app-scoped-ids&quot;&gt;Facebook responded as follows&lt;/a&gt;: “&lt;em&gt;This is intentional behavior in our product. We do not consider it a security vulnerability, but we do have controls in place to monitor and mitigate abuse&lt;/em&gt;.” A Facebook interface with similar &lt;a href=&quot;https://salt.agency/blog/facebook-security-loophole/&quot;&gt;controls&lt;/a&gt; was reportedly used to harvest of 2 Billion Facebook users’ public profile data. Note that although &lt;a href=&quot;https://snarfed.org/2015-10-25_de-anonymizing-facebooks-app-scoped-ids&quot;&gt;the endpoint found by the researchers&lt;/a&gt; does not work anymore, the following endpoint still redirects to users’ profile page: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/[app_scoped_ID&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/[app_scoped_ID&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;APPENDIX:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix 1 — Measurement Methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To study the abuse of social login APIs we extended &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/citp/OpenWPM&quot;&gt;OpenWPM&lt;/a&gt; to simulate that the user has authenticated and given full permissions to the Facebook Login SDK on all sites. We added instrumentation to monitor the use of the Facebook SDK interface (`window.FB`). We did not otherwise inject the user’s identity into the page, so any exfiltrated personal data must have been queried from our spoofed API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://freedom-to-tinker.com/tag/noboundaries/&quot;&gt;previous measurements&lt;/a&gt;, we crawled 50,000 sites from the Alexa top 1 million in June 2017. We used the following sampling strategy: visit all of the top 15,000 sites, randomly sample 15,000 sites from the Alexa rank range [15,000 100,000), and randomly sample 20,000 sites from the range [100,000, 1,000,000). This combination allowed us to observe the attacks on both high and low traffic sites. On each of these 50,000 sites we visited 6 pages: the front page and a set of 5 other pages randomly sampled from the internal links on the front page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To spoof that a user is logged in, we create our own `window.FB` object and replicate the interface of &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.facebook.com/docs/javascript/reference/v2.8&quot;&gt;version 2.8 of the Facebook SDK&lt;/a&gt;. The spoofed API has the following properties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For method calls that normally return personal information we spoof the return values as if the user is logged in and call and necessary callback function arguments.
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;These include `FB.api()`, `FB.init(), `FB.getLoginStatus()`, `FB.Event.subscribe()` for the events `auth.login`, `auth.authResponseChange`, and `auth.statusChange`, and `FB.getAuthResponse()`.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the Graph API (`FB.api`), we support most of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/user&quot;&gt;profile data fields&lt;/a&gt; supported by the real Facebook SDK. We parse the requested fields and return a data object in the same format the real graph API would return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For method calls that don’t return personal information we simply call a no-op function and ignore any callback arguments. This helps minimize breakage if a site calls a method we don’t fully replicate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We fire `window.fbAsyncInit` once the document has finished loading. This function is normally called by the Facebook SDK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spoofed `window.FB` object is injected into every frame on every page load, regardless of the presence of a real Facebook SDK. We then monitor access to the API using OpenWPM’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/citp/OpenWPM#instrumentation-and-data-access&quot;&gt;Javascript call monitoring&lt;/a&gt;. All HTTP request and response data, include HTTP POST payloads are examined to detect the exfiltration of any of the spoofed profile data (including that which has been hashed or encoded).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For both calls to `window.FB` and HTTP data, we store the Javascript stack trace at the time of execution. We use this stack trace to understand which APIs scripts accessed and when they were sending data back. For some scripts our instrumentation only captured the API access, but not the exfiltration. In these cases, we manually debugged the scripts to determine whether the data was only used locally or if it was obfuscated before being transmitted. We explicitly note the cases where we could not make this determination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix 2 — Third parties which access the Facebook API on behalf of first parties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also found a number of third-party scripts interacting with the Facebook API, which appear to be operating on behalf of the first party [2]. These companies offer a range of services, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gigya.com/platform/feature/social-login/&quot;&gt;integrating multiple social login options&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zummydirect.com/&quot;&gt;monitoring social media engagement&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blueconic.com/&quot;&gt;aggregating customer data&lt;/a&gt;. As a specific example, BlueConic offers a &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.blueconic.com/hc/en-us/articles/202531982-Facebook-Connect-Profile-Transfer-Connection&quot;&gt;Facebook Profile transfer service&lt;/a&gt;, that copies information from the user’s Facebook profile information to BlueConic’s data platform. Additional third-party services which access Facebook profile information on the first party’s behalf include: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zummycloud.com/&quot;&gt;Zummy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://socialminer.com/&quot;&gt;Social Miner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.limespot.com/personalizer&quot;&gt;Limespot (personalizer.io)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kissmetrics.com/&quot;&gt;Kissmetrics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gigya.com/&quot;&gt;Gigya&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webtrends.com/&quot;&gt;Webtrends&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook to ask everyone to accept being tracked so they can keep using it</title>
<link>https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-gdpr-latest-data-ad-tracking-opt-out-stop-ads-marketing-a8310031.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-gdpr-latest-data-ad-tracking-opt-out-stop-ads-marketing-a8310031.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Facebook is going to ask all of its users whether they want to be tracked as they use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site will ask all of its users to explicitly opt in to having themselves tracked so that they can keep using Facebook, and tell them to limit that collection using its settings if they don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the site has warned that it will never be possible to turn off all ad tracking, as it isn't on many websites. People will always have the option to leave entirely, a senior member of staff said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New privacy laws come into effect from the European Union this May, which apply to all companies who collect data on people within Europe. Many parts of those new regulations seem to pose challenges for Facebook’s business, including new rules about what information can be harvested about users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-gallery&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-atom-rendered&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;container grid-mod-gallery&quot; data-scald-gallery=&quot;5705671&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;gallery-title&quot;&gt;How to stop Facebook from revealing everything about you&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said that it will now give people the chance to opt into targeted marketing, and having their data collected for ads. If they don't want to do that, they will be able to turn some of the settings off, but the site has made very clear that will not apply to all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU law known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which takes effect next month, promises the biggest shakeup in online privacy since the birth of the internet. Companies face fines if they collect or use personal information without permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook deputy chief privacy officer Rob Sherman said the social network would begin seeking Europeans’ permission this week for a variety of ways Facebook uses their data, but he said that opting out of targeted marketing altogether would not be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Facebook is an advertising-supported service,” Sherman said in a briefing with reporters at Facebook’s headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook users will be able to limit the kinds of data that advertisers use to target their pitches, he added, but “all ads on Facebook are targeted to some extent, and that’s true for offline advertising, as well”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, the world’s largest social media network, will use what are known as “permission screens” – pages filled with text that require pressing a button to advance – to notify and obtain approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screens will show up on the Facebook website and smartphone app in Europe this week and globally in the coming months, Sherman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screens will not give Facebook users the option to hit “decline.” Instead, they will guide users to either “accept and continue” or “manage data setting,” according to copies the company showed reporters on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People can choose to not be on Facebook if they want,” Sherman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators, investors and privacy advocates are closely watching how Facebook plans to comply with the EU law, not only because Facebook has been embroiled in a privacy scandal but also because other companies may follow its lead in trying to limit the impact of opt-outs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Facebook disclosed that the personal information of millions of users, mostly in the United States, had wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, leading to US congressional hearings and worldwide scrutiny of Facebook’s commitment to privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook chief financial officer David Wehner warned in February the company could see a drop-off in usage due to the GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Additional reporting by agencies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

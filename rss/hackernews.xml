<title>Daniel Kahneman on when to trust intuitive judgment</title>

<description>&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-298844&quot; src=&quot;https://images.thinkadvisor.com/contrib/content/uploads/sites/415/2018/06/Kahneman_Daniel_BB_MI.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Daniel Kahneman.

&lt;p&gt;Can intuition play a role in investing? According to Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel Memorial Prize-winning behavioral economist, no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a speech given at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wobi.com/wbf-nyc/&quot;&gt;World Business Forum in New York City&lt;/a&gt;, Kahneman explained when people can trust their intuitive judgement and when they should be wary of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Intuition is defined as knowing without knowing how you know,” he explained. “That’s the wrong definition. Because by that definition, you cannot have the wrong intuition. It presupposes that we know, and there is really a prejudice in favor of intuition. We like intuitions to be right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Kahneman, a better definition — or a more precise one — would be that “intuition is thinking that you know without knowing why you do.” By this definition, the intuition could be right or it could be wrong, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because, according to Kahneman, intuition can often be wrong. To show an example of this, Kahneman had the crowd guess the GPA of a college senior he called Julie. He told the crowd one fact about Julie — that she read fluently at a young age — and then asked them to judge how good of a student she had been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From research, Kahneman, who wrote &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555&quot;&gt;“Thinking, Fast and Slow,”&lt;/a&gt; said that most people guess that Julie has around a 3.7 GPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You might think that this is a good answer,” he said. “It’s a terrible answer. It’s an intuition, and it’s absolutely wrong. If you were to do it statistically, you would do it completely differently. Actually, the age that people read is very little information about what student they will be 20 years later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Kahneman, this is an example of an intuition that is generated automatically with high confidence, and it’s wrong statistically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In general, confidence is a very poor cue to accuracy. Because intuitions come to your mind with considerable confidence and there is no guarantee they’re right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are certain times when intuition can be correct. For instance, Kahneman explained, chess players and married couples generally have accurate intuition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Intuitions of master chess players when they look at the board [and make a move], they’re accurate,” he said. “Everybody who’s been married could guess their wife’s or their husband’s mood by one word on the telephone. That’s an intuition and it’s generally very good, and very accurate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Kahneman, who’s studied when one can trust intuition and when one cannot, there are three conditions that need to be met in order to trust one’s intuition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is that there has to be some regularity in the world that someone can pick up and learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, chess players certainly have it. Married people certainly have it,” Kahnemen explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, he added, people who pick stocks in the stock market do not have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because, the stock market is not sufficiently regular to support developing that kind of expert intuition,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second condition for accurate intuition is “a lot of practice,” according to Kahneman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the third condition is immediate feedback. Kahneman said that “you have to know almost immediately whether you got it right or got it wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When those three kinds of conditions are satisfied, people develop expert intuition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But unless those three conditions are satisfied, the mere fact that you have an idea and nothing else comes to mind and you feel a great deal of confidence — absolutely does not guarantee accuracy,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Spectrum is joining GitHub</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://spectrum.chat/spectrum/general/spectrum-is-joining-github~1d3eb8ee-4c99-46c0-8daf-ca35a96be6ce</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;&quot; data-block=&quot;true&quot; data-editor=&quot;thread-detail&quot; data-offset-key=&quot;foo-0-0&quot; readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key=&quot;foo-0-0&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-text=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Back in February 2017, Brian, Max, and I started working on a side project with the goal of building a space for our own communities. After releasing an early prototype, people told us they also wanted to use it for their communities, so we decided to go all-in and build an open, inclusive home for developer and designer communities. Since officially launching the platform late last year, Spectrum has become home to almost 5,000 communities!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;&quot; data-block=&quot;true&quot; data-editor=&quot;thread-detail&quot; data-offset-key=&quot;k71i-0-0&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key=&quot;k71i-0-0&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-text=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Today, we’re thrilled to announce that Spectrum is joining GitHub!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;Image__ImageContainer-sc-1cjkr2p-0 kRUkdB&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;draftJsFocusPlugin__unfocused__1Wvrs Image__Img-sc-1cjkr2p-2 cBQipf&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.imgix.net/threads/1d3eb8ee-4c99-46c0-8daf-ca35a96be6ce/1741fe95-da77-44a6-97b2-a092f5d3d12d-GH%252BSpectrum-V2-Attachment.png?expires=1543622400000&amp;amp;ixlib=js-1.2.0&amp;amp;s=c765a0245175247413706fad2fa263aa&quot; direction=&quot;LTR&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

All three of us are joining GitHub to continue to work towards those same goals, building the best community platform just as we always have.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;The records of 500 million customers of the hotel group Marriott International have been involved in a data breach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hotel chain said the guest reservation database of its Starwood division had been compromised by an unauthorised party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said an internal investigation found an attacker had been able to access the Starwood network since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it would notify customers whose records were in the database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marriott International bought Starwood in 2016, creating the largest hotel chain in the world with more than 5,800 properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starwood's hotel brands include W Hotels, Sheraton, Le Méridien and Four Points by Sheraton. Marriott-branded hotels use a separate reservation system on a different network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marriott said it was alerted by an internal security tool that somebody was attempting to access the Starwood database. After investigating, it discovered that an &quot;unauthorised party had copied and encrypted information&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said it believed its database contained records of up to 500 million customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For about 327 million guests, the information included &quot;some combination&quot; of:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;name&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;arrival and departure information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said some records also included encrypted payment card information, but it could not rule out the possibility that the encryption keys had also been stolen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We deeply regret this incident happened,&quot; the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Marriott reported this incident to law enforcement and continues to support their investigation.  The company has already begun notifying regulatory authorities.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has set up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://answers.kroll.com/&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; to give affected customers more information. It will also offer customers in the US and some other countries a year-long subscription to a fraud-detecting service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the UK's Information Commissioner's Office said: &quot;We have received a data breach report from Marriott involving its Starwood Hotels and will be making enquiries. If anyone has concerns about how their data has been handled they can report these concerns to us.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;What should I do if I'm affected?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Marriott group said it would contact affected customers whose email addresses were in the Starwood reservation database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The database contained details of reservations made on or before 10 September 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has set up a dedicated &lt;a href=&quot;https://answers.kroll.com/&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;help website&lt;/a&gt; for those affected and is also operating a free helpline. For UK customers the number is 0808 189 1065.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marriott is not certain whether the attackers were able to obtain payment information, so be aware of any suspicious transactions on your account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also be aware that scammers may be sending out mass emails pretending to represent the Marriott group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company says it will not include attachments in its notification emails and will not ask for personal information over email. If in doubt, call the helpline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is offering affected customers a year-long subscription to a fraud-checking service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;by Chris Fox, technology reporter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not the biggest data breach we've ever seen (that dubious honour goes to Yahoo!) but it's certainly up there with some of the worst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only were up to 500 million customer records accessed and potentially copied, but the attackers had had unauthorised access since 2014. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even though payment card information was encrypted, the company thinks the key may have been stolen too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK's data regulator has confirmed it is investigating, and so the threat of a whopping &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/technology-44006602/what-is-gdpr-technology-explained&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;GDPR penalty&lt;/a&gt; looms.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the Marriott group's headquarters are in the US, it has to comply with the EU's GDPR rules when dealing with citizens in the EU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way it has disclosed this breach, notified customers and offered fraud-checking services will certainly help its cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the ICO and other international regulators may rule the company has been too slow to act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always with a big data breach, be aware that scammers may send out emails claiming to be from the Marriott group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hotel chain says it will not send any notification emails with attachments, and will not request any information from its customers by email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has Marriott International contacted you to say your details have been compromised?

<title>Mozilla pulls Bypass Paywalls from Firefox add-ons store</title>
<link>https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-firefox/issues/82</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-firefox/issues/82</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;While this is extremely dubious behavior from Mozilla, and reminds me why I stopped donating to them (the moment Firefox started requiring &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; signature in order to load addons), Mozilla still has the &quot;automated signing API&quot; in place. Supposedly, this API allows to get an XPI signed as long as it passes a series of automated checks. So it's worth a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the excuse they used anyway when trying to justify their signature requirements were &quot;not a walled garden&quot;. I didn't believe it of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also just mark the addon as &quot;not listed in AMO&quot; when submitting it to addons.mozilla.org and it will not be listed on the store, but it will be signed. More details in &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/Distribution&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/Distribution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Openly sharing your work brings more attention to it, which is good, right? The answer, for me though, is often “it’s complicated.”&lt;/strong&gt; This is what happened when I went to visit a giant tech company, in hopes for collaboration, but later found that they tried to &lt;a href=&quot;https://patentpandas.org/resources/what-is-a-patent&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;patent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; some of my research instead!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How it started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My work in electronic books started when I was still an undergrad, during a research internship where I made a pop-up book with lights and sensors in the pop-up elements.  This was under the guidance of my advisor Leah Buechley.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since that time I’ve fallen in love with paper and electronics and books and storytelling.  And have since played with other ways to combine electronics with books, such as a sketchbook with a power supply for “sketching” in circuits.  As well as trying to tell stories with interactivity, such as a storybook about an LED named Ellie, who dreams to be a star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&quot; data-block-type=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_1_1543514007455_20271&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rewind to March 24, 2014, during the second year of my PhD at the Media Lab.  I was invited to visit Google ATAP (Advanced Technology and Projects) to learn about some of their new projects in storytelling.  I got to visit their space, meet some of my creative heroes and I shared with them all of my work in interactive books and storytelling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What started as just a visit quickly turned into a job interview. I was even invited to share my work directly with Regina Dugan, the director of ATAP at that time! I was excited, thinking perhaps I would be invited for a summer internship. It turned out they found my work so relevant that they offered me a job on the spot.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a tough choice: I was two years into my PhD and would’ve had to take a leave from the program to pursue this project. After asking many people, the advice was clear: stay in school. So I decided to turn down the offer and continue pursuing my PhD. That’s where the glitter ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;They’re trying to patent electronic pop-up books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years later, in March 2016 I find out from some paper engineering friends that some of the same people who had interviewed me had also applied for patents on interactive pop-up books with electronics.  These patents covered many of the same things that had discussed, that I’d showed them, with no mention of my or others’ work in the field.  I found out from a friend who followed a pop-up book blog—someone there was excited that google was researching book technologies and happened to publish a blog post about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly there was a possibility that a giant tech company might have a patent over technologies that we all wanted to develop and work on.  My fellow paper geeks and I were pretty worried. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what do we do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well mind you, I found out about this about three weeks after I found out about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://patentpandas.org/stories/crowdfunding-backer-patented-my-project&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LED stickers patent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a totally unrelated incident in which our crowdfunding campaign backer successfully patented our product.  Normally I would’ve thought “oh there’s way too much &lt;a href=&quot;https://patentpandas.org/resources/prior-art&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;prior art&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” and this patent can’t pass.  But after seeing what happened to LED stickers, I couldn’t be so sure anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the fact that these two unrelated situations were happening to me simultaneously kind of made it all feel a bit absurd.  And luckily, because I had experience from the first patent issue, I was able to be much more calm this time around! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Don’t panic.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the best advice I ever got was to not let worry about legal matters distract you from what matters: doing your work.  So after calming down, I…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Make a prior art list.&lt;/strong&gt;  I made a list of all of my own publications involving books and electronics: academic papers, blog posts, videos, media and press.  I also included work from others—it doesn’t have to be your own work; anyone’s work will do for prior art!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Get legal help!&lt;/strong&gt; Because these are not things to handle alone, especially if the patents are being filed by a giant company!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we found&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked up the patent application and luckily, this time the patent application was still being reviewed by the patent examiner.  It had not issued! The provisional was filed August 29, 2014, months after my first interview and visit back in March 2014.  Two of the inventors listed were the same people who had interviewed me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what did we do? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, because it was still a patent application, we could still submit prior art to it.  My friend and collaborator Akiba generously did just that by submitting my research paper directly onto the application page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, and &lt;em&gt;very luckily&lt;/em&gt; for me, the director of the Media Lab Joi Ito knew the director of ATAP at the time, Regina. He was able to get in touch with her directly and we were able to quickly schedule a chat to address the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image&quot; data-block-type=&quot;5&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_1_1543515553422_106470&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&quot; data-block-type=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_1_1543515553422_106746&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we had a call directly with their team. As part of negotiations, they offered to add me as an inventor on the patent application if it meant the application could stand.  I said no, because in order for me to be an inventor on they patent they would have to add all the other inventors who have contributed to blending books and electronics—I’m not the only one working on this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I didn’t realize at the time is that there’s actually a huge difference between inventor and assignee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;inventor&lt;/strong&gt; is the one credited with coming up with the idea for an invention.  The &lt;strong&gt;assignee&lt;/strong&gt; actually gets the legal rights to the patent.  It’s a bit like how an architect (the “inventor”) may design a house but it’s the home owner (the “assignee”) that gets to live in it, and very often those aren’t the same people.  It’s the same situation here: Google ATAP would’ve still owned the patent rights even if I got to be listed as an inventor.  Meaning even though I would be on the patent and get credit for the work, I wouldn’t actually get rights to use the invention.  Luckily I dodged that one, even though it was by accident!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next the strange thing was that about a couple weeks into the conversation, Regina left Google ATAP. In the process, she put us directly in touch with ATAP’s senior council, who thankfully agreed to submit all of the prior art we had sent them to the USPTO as prior art for the patent application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image&quot; data-block-type=&quot;5&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_1_1543515553422_139817&quot;&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;thumb-image&quot; alt=&quot;prior art books submitted&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5af0d38a5417fc945678ffd4/t/5c00380440ec9afaa91494e7/1543518220279/prior+art+books+submitted&quot; data-image=&quot;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5af0d38a5417fc945678ffd4/t/5c00380440ec9afaa91494e7/1543518220279/prior+art+books+submitted&quot; data-image-dimensions=&quot;1826x922&quot; data-image-focal-point=&quot;0.5,0.5&quot; data-load=&quot;false&quot; data-image-id=&quot;5c00380440ec9afaa91494e7&quot; data-type=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&quot; data-block-type=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_1_1543515553422_140093&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent application has since been rejected and abandoned, which means that for now the application is not being pursued as a patent.  Even more good news: abandoned applications stay in the USPTO’s system, so it’s now prior art!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good story, right?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, I was incredibly lucky to have the support of a large institution (MIT) and even more lucky that we had a direct connection to ATAP through Joi to sort out the situation. I’m super grateful but realize that most other people in my position probably would not have had it so well.  And I’m not sure what to tell them—unfortunately.  Only that if one were trying to contact a large institution about patent issues, definitely do not go at it alone. Make sure to get a legal expert.  Even in our navigating the patent issues with ATAP, we also always had the guidance of lawyers and legal experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did I learn? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My biggest fear was that my fellow paper engineering friends and I would not be able to explore books and electronics further if these patents went through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, It turns out that at many large companies who have their own internal patent attorneys, it’s common for employees to get bonuses in the thousands of dollars for just sharing their work with the legal team or turning the disclosure into a patent application. There’s bigger bonuses if the patent issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned that there are even lunch sessions at some big companies where people get to sit and chat with a patent lawyer to see if some patent could be drafted.  If there’s a bonus attached, there’s even more incentive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If students got the same bonuses for applying for patents, I can assure you there would be more patents coming from universities!  What I mean is, it’s possible that sometimes people are less motivated by legal rights to a particular invention and more so by other incentives like getting financial bonuses, the validation and prestige of being a patent holder, or beefing up the patent statistics of a company for valuation purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What about openly sharing work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the end, unfortunately, I don’t have a perfect answer.  Because on the one hand, sharing your work may lead to amazing collaborations with large companies that have the types of resources and expertise to get amazing, imagination-filled projects off the ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, you may also run the risk of having work being patented away. In this case of electronic pop-up books, it appears that the people on the team have since stopped working on the project and the outside world wont know whatever became of it. The good news, though, is that since the patents never went through, the project itself is still &lt;a href=&quot;https://patentpandas.org/resources/open-vs-closed-patents&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;open for exploration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Meaning anyone can still continue innovating on electronic pop-up books without worrying about these patents!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I like to err on the side of sharing more.  At the end of the day, it was my research papers and the published work of others that stopped the patent applications in their tracks.  While sharing stuff out means more people see them, it also means there’s more prior art to draw upon to keep an idea open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, sharing work publicly keeps the project can alive and inspires others to continue developing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt; Jie Qi (Berkman Klein Center, MIT Media Lab)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Google Container for Firefox – Prevent Google from tracking you around the web</title>
<link>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/google-container/?src=recommended</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/google-container/?src=recommended</guid>
<description>&lt;strong&gt;THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL ADDON FROM MOZILLA! It is a fork of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-container/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Facebook Container&lt;/a&gt; addon.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does it do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Google Container works by isolating your Google identity into a separate container that makes it harder for Google to track your visits to other websites with third-party cookies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does it work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Installing this extension deletes your Google cookies and logs you out of Google.&lt;br/&gt;The next time you navigate to Google it will load in a new red colored browser tab (the “Container”).&lt;br/&gt;You can log in and use Google normally when in the Google Container. If you click on a non-Google link or navigate to a non-Google website in the URL bar, these pages will load outside of the container.&lt;br/&gt;Clicking Google Share buttons on other browser tabs will load them within the Google Container. You should know that using these buttons passes information to Google about the website that you shared from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which website features will not function?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because you will be logged into Google only in the Container, embedded Google comments and Like buttons in tabs outside the Google Container will not work. This prevents Google from associating information about your activity on websites outside of Google to your Google identity.&lt;p&gt;In addition, websites that allow you to create an account or log in using your Google credentials will generally not work properly. Because this extension is designed to separate Google use from use of other websites, this behavior is expected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does Google Container NOT protect against?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is important to know that this extension doesn’t prevent Google from mishandling the data that it already has, or permitted others to obtain, about you. Google still will have access to everything that you do while you are on &lt;a href=&quot;https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/a715a41c3c6bb93de925c4d53cb98425432b2b59209e61fedd8a8d2a54b4132e/http%3A//google.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;google.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than stop using a service you find valuable, we think you should have tools to limit what data others can obtain. This extension focuses on limiting Google tracking, but other ad networks may try to correlate your Google activities with your regular browsing. In addition to this extension, you can change your Google settings, use Private Browsing, enable Tracking Protection, block third-party cookies, and/or use &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Firefox Multi-Account Containers&lt;/a&gt; extension to further limit tracking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We do never collect any data, all the data we see, you see.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Containers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Google Container leverages the Containers feature that is already built in to Firefox. When you enable Google Container, you may also see Containers named Personal, Work, Shopping, and Banking while you browse. If you wish to use multiple Containers, you’ll have the best user experience if you install the Firefox &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Firefox Multi-Account Containers&lt;/a&gt; extension. You should also check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/temporary-containers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Temporary Containers&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; If you are a &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Firefox Multi-Account Containers&lt;/a&gt; user who has already assigned Google to a Container, this extension will not work. In an effort to preserve your existing Container set up and logins, this add-on will not include the additional protection to keep other sites out of your Google Container. If you would like this additional protection, first unassign &lt;a href=&quot;https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/a715a41c3c6bb93de925c4d53cb98425432b2b59209e61fedd8a8d2a54b4132e/http%3A//google.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;google.com&lt;/a&gt; in the Multi-Account Container extension, and then install this extension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommended privacy enhancing Add-ons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/decentraleyes/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Decentraleyes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;  Protects you against tracking through “free”, centralized, content delivery by automatically injecting local resources if possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/dont-track-me-google1/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Don’t track me google &lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; If your search-engine of choice happens to be Google this Add-on will remove the tracking automatically placed on result-links. Or just use &lt;a href=&quot;https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/c710321df5850382b86e643ffe56b162ec3753b2fefc46d82b18fb93fe1c44f3/https%3A//www.startpage.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;startpage.com&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/https-everywhere&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;HTTPS Everywhere&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;  Automatically redirects you to the secure version of websites if available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/requestcontrol/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Request Control:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Lets you filter session, ref, utm and more query parameters from URLs and can also circumvent outgoing trackers on websites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;uBlock Origin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  I guess you already know this one. If not, check it out.&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Starting a Business in Silicon Valley</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;March 22, 2018&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5 id=&quot;apersonalstory&quot;&gt;A Personal Story&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This is the text of an essay I read in a presentation at African Leadership University in Mauritius. Please see the video of that presentation &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/huOzokY_fME&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. For the other lectures from that trip, please see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6HWLJqTASA&amp;amp;list=PLP0dfLFk-anezfZZMB4Dh-78x_6zVsxIm&quot;&gt;this playlist&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to starting a business, Silicon Valley is kind of a special place. You can start a successful business anywhere in the world, but no other place has the home of Google, Apple, Facebook, Tesla, and Netflix. Startup accelerators like Y Combinator and 500 Startups seek out new and perhaps inexperienced talent and give them the money and guidance they need to serve billion dollar markets. Angel investors rich on the Silicon Valley gold rush try their hand at investment, writing $50,000 checks in the coffee shops of Palo Alto - the birthplace of the personal computer. Stanford University pushes out some of the world's most talented minds and nearby Sand Hill Road feeds them cash from billion dollar Venture Capital funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley is the place where Mark Zuckerberg - a college drop out - was given $500,000 to continue development on a website that made no money. Zuckerberg, who is the same age I am, is now worth $70 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grew up just 45 minutes from Silicon Valley in a small town in the Santa Cruz Mountains called Ben Lomond. My father was an Electrical Engineer from Lockheed Missiles and Space, whose first job out of college was developing guidance systems for rockets at Vandenberg Air Force Base. When I was two years old he was transferred to their Sunnyvale facility, and one of my earliest memories was my third birthday at a hotel in the mountain town I would call my home for almost 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Lomond is a town filled with 1000 year old redwood trees that tower above you at 100 meters tall. The trees draw in so much fog and rain from the ocean that the valley I lived in is considered a temperate rainforest. When I was very young my parents separated, and I spent my childhood safe at home while my mom worked, I remember always the rainfall through the picture window. The nearby university focuses on environmental protection, and I was raised with an appreciation for our Earth and all that it provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was four years old, I told my parents I wanted to be an inventor. At age 5 I took the film winding motor from an old camera and added it to a plastic toy car - perhaps my first invention. As I got a little older my engineer father began to insist &quot;inventor&quot; isn't a job. And so at age 11 when I watched a show on robotics on The Learning Channel, I knew at that moment I wanted to run my own robotics company. I have been hell bent on it ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the search for college came around, I found a school close to home that had a great robotics program - Santa Clara University - and finally landed myself in Silicon Valley. I didn't know it at the time, but I'd be living in the area for 15 more years and counting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In college I started to notice other businesses people had founded where they were able to work on their dreams. Sparkfun Electronics sold open source gadgets for hobbyists. I was amazed when, after 8 or so years in business, they shared a plot of their year over year revenue figures since their founding. They had doubled in size every year until they were doing $30m in sales annually. I've always been smart and confident in myself, and so I felt strongly that if others could do this well, so could I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would eventually drop out of college - I was more interested in staying home and building robots than going to class - and worked for 7 years doing Mechanical Design and manufacturing at a small engineering shop in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was during my time in that position that I really started to experiment with engineering at home on my own time. I was learning some wonderful skills at my day job and I wanted to apply them to something interesting. I started to learn electronics design at home. I spent evenings reading tutorials online and using free software to design LED lighting for my office long before you could buy LED lighting at the corner store. I learned how to read manufacturer's datasheets and turn specifications and diagrams in to functional designs. I ordered circuit boards from china and learned surface mount soldering at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the while, my goal was to learn every facet of robotics. I did mechanical design at work, electronics at home, and started to dabble in more advanced software as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I started to put it all together. After several years doing design and manufacturing at my day job, I started to work on software projects there too. I designed a tablet computer from scratch and integrated electrical components from different vendors to make it a reality. I put together a touch panel over an LCD screen, found a single board computer I could program, designed a case for the whole system and wrote all the software for it. At home I started exploring the design of custom brushless linear motors - devices with one moving part that turn electrical energy in to linear motion. I designed the electronics, wrote software, and machined the mechanicals. I even made the electric motor winder out of an old drill motor and a beer bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 7 years at my day job job, I was itching for something new. Finally I found a famous speech from Steve Jobs - his Stanford Commencement Speech - that said roughly: If you wake up every day and you don't like what you're going to do, then go out and change it. The world is not run by special people somehow more capable than most, but regular people no smarter than you or I who found themselves at the right place and the right time. If you're not happy with your life, then don't keep doing it. Find your passion and follow it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew that the job I was working at - Mechanical Engineer at an industrial tool supplier - was not my passion. I wake up every day and I see a world that could be made better with robots. I see people going to work doing things they don't want to do, and I see how we could make robots to help them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I quit. I had no plan and no money. It was probably a bad idea, but somehow it worked out. My employer didn't want to lose me, and we worked out a deal where I would agree to stay full time for a few more months, and then stay on one day a week for another year while receiving my full salary. Honestly I feel guilty for that - it doesn't seem like a fair deal to my boss, but it was his company and it seems he wanted me. I'm still indebted both figuratively and literally for all the help he gave me while we worked together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I got my chance. I wanted to form a company around the linear motors I was developing. I didn't know anything about how to run a business. People asked me what my business plan was and I said &quot;make hardware and sell it&quot;. What I would make exactly or who I would sell it to or why they would buy it from me were questions I had no answer to and no strong motivation to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent months designing new hardware - winding motors, writing software simulations, designing new PCBs, 3D printing housings, machining aluminum, and making calibration fixtures. I went to a trade show and set up a booth and people loved what I was trying to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after pouring months in to the project, I was scarcely closer to production than I was when I began. I had a fabulous prototype, but not a product. I didn't even understand the distinction at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is Silicon Valley - a place flooded with investment in all kinds of crazy ideas. Mobile apps were all the rage, but there exists a small faction of engineers and start ups in the area that are focused on making hardware. I regularly took my prototypes to the hardware startup meetups and was looking for any investment I could find. I made friends who had gone through Stanford Business school who tried to tell me I was asking for too much money and lacked a solid business plan. I wanted $500k investment and I was the only employee!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I would learn the hard way that the money doesn't come that easy. I had been reading Techcrunch - a valley blog focused on the goings on of investment in the tech world - and all the stories of success let me believe that anyone with an idea could find investment. But my product was complex. I had no market. And I had no team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was working with a friend for a little while on the project - a seasoned embedded software engineer 20 years my senior, who normally worked for rates I could never afford but enjoyed working with me enough to work for free as a business partner. I was too controlling, too overbearing. I argued with him. It stopped being fun for him, and he politely informed me he would no longer keep working with me. I rushed him because I wanted to build a product demo, but he wanted to build something reliable. I wish I had let him work. The good news is we're still friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the time I was doing all this, the Facebook movie came out. As I mentioned, Mark Zuckerberg is one of Silicon Valley's success stories, and the dramatic retelling of his story made the startup life look irresistible. This college dropout spent his evenings drinking beer and working at his computer (just like me!) and soon a Silicon Valley venture capital firm was writing him a check for $500,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no idea how far I was from where he had been, but all the stories of success from Techcrunch, the accelerator Y Combinator, and the Facebook movie combined and fed in to my fantasies that somehow through sheer will and my own brain power I could achieve similar success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid my mother always underscored how intelligent I am. And certainly I did well in school. In 8th grade I got first place in the county math contest and won a graphing calculator as a prize. But I never did meet people as smart as some of the founders I've come across in more recent years. I am still confident that I am smart, but I think a dose of humility could have done me well when I was younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I was convinced I could find my success on the funding circuit in Silicon Valley. But after trying to raise funds for my robotics business for six months, I was coming up with nothing. I was running out of money and my product was plagued with serious problems. The motor didn't move well at low speeds, it would overheat, and the latest electronics design had some unknown flaw that caused boards to fail after just 5 minutes of operation. I had a complicated product that really needed an electrical engineer, a mechanical engineer, and a software engineer just to get it working - nevermind the fact that we had no business person to find customers and help define the product specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was running out of money and had no customers. Something serious had to change. And so, never one to give up, I did what Silicon Valley calls a &quot;pivot&quot;. I had recently added a wireless controller to the robot I was working on, and was amazed at how cheap the wireless chips were. In my own experience, adding wireless to a product was expensive and frought with difficulty. I wondered - if I threw out all the complicated mechanics of my product and just focused on an easy to use wireless board for hobbyist projects, would that be a simple enough product for me to design myself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was worth a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the next six months designing prototypes - software, hardware, and tech demos. My girlfriend joined in with me and started writing marketing copy, designing an awesome website, and emailing media contacts who would publicize us when we were ready - we had decided to launch our product on Kickstarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a very busy time. I barely slept. I lost 20 pounds. I got in a fight with my father after he declined my request to borrow money. I found three friends who would loan me money - to the tune of $10,000 - to keep me going when I had totally run out of cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week before the launch, I still didn't have a good plan for pricing, so I made it up. I knew I wanted the main board to be $20 - even though the final boards weren't designed so I couldn't get quotes. I guessed on prices for all of the accessories too. The project needed a funding goal - the amount that backers have to pledge before you'll get any money. That's a tricky one - if the amount is too low, you can get too little funding to actually do the work you're planning. Set the funding goal too high and it will be too difficult to get the money you need - and many people who see a high limit won't even pledge because they don't think it's worth it! I made up the number - $80,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We knew we wanted to offer accessories for the product, so I came up with a few ideas and put them down. We came up with 5-10 different kits people could buy with all this stuff. We had pricing, marketing materials, prototypes, a cool video we had produced with a great video producer, and media contacts at the ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, launch came. Thanks to the work of my girlfriend and business partner at the time, we had amazing media coverage on the first day. That Silicon Valley blog I mentioned before - techcrunch? - they had an article on our campaign on the first day. Along with Hackaday, QZ, and Hacker News. We did a reddit AMA. She even got me an interview for a California radio station! We blew past the $80,000 funding goal in just 8 days, and by the end of the campaign in September 2013, we had raised $150,000 from 1600 backers. This little wireless board sold 4000 units in just 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a day many of us who tinker find ourselves dreaming of. We love to make things and we dream of one day making something that give us overflowing bank accounts and acclaim from our peers. And with the help of some dedicated friends, I found myself in just that position. And I felt sick to my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd been working like crazy for months, and with the closing of our campaign our fate was sealed - we'd made a lot of promises and now we had to deliver. I had promised delivery in six months. But what did I have? I had prototypes. The plan was to redesign the hardware before delivery to use an upgraded processor, a better radio, and a slick design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would take 18 months before the first final hardware was ordered, by which time I had almost completely run out of money. I had just enough cash to order 1000 units with no accessories and get them shipped out to the backers. I could prove to the world that the product existed, but 3/4 of my customers would have to wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this time I was drinking pretty heavily every night and smoking a lot of weed. As the clock ticked and my cash got closer to zero, I had no idea what I was going to do. I'd only every had one job in silicon valley and I had quit it to start a company that didn't work out, only to pivot, run out of money, and then start another company that was going nowhere. I worked as hard as I could but the stress was killing me. My girlfriend, who had started the company with me, had long since stopped being my business partner. I couldn't afford to pay for her living and we could never figure out how to work together after the campaign ended. I had been so stressed I stopped being a good romantic partner to her, and eventually she told me she was leaving me. She'd been loaning me rent for six months, I never wanted to leave the house, and I was a wreck every day. It hurt more than I can describe, but I don't blame her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself with no money, no girlfriend, and no place to go. That was and still is the lowest place I ever got in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at the same time, I had been looking for work. On a Thursday evening I went to a local robotics meet up and met someone who ran his own robotics company. They were hiring, and I managed to get an interview the following day. I told him I could only work three days a week - I had a business to run and I needed to figure out how to fund it. Amazingly, he offered to give me a loan to help with that if I would work full time. And so as we walked around the neighborhood near the garage his company started in, he agreed to loan me $55k in addition to a decent salary if I would start work immediately. I thought about it over the weekend, and then reported to work Monday morning. Within a week he'd written me a check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retelling this story now has me realizing that perhaps there is more magic in Silicon Valley than I have given it credit for. I was in a very low place, and that offer helped keep my dream alive when I thought it was over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was now two nearly years after my Kickstarter campaign had launched. I had a big lump of cash again and a job to pay my bills. I discovered that the $55k loan wasn't enough, and convinced my mother to co-sign on another $18k loan which she had borrowed against her home. I was finally able to order all the hardware I needed to close out the campaign - and between the back rent I owed my ex and the two loans, I was $85k in debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change in my life was significant. I had to move out of the apartment I had been living in for two years - it was more my ex's place than mine. I was no longer working from home either - I had to show up to work every day. I was working as a software engineer, and while I'd been writing software for 15 years by then, I'd never written a lot of it. I quit drinking alcohol and I quit smoking weed. I started riding my road bike and losing weight. I focused on my new job and on my personal health. I didn't do a lot of work for my business - we called it Flutter Wireless - for six months or so. Around October 2015, I transferred $61,000 to a bank account in Shenzhen China. I'd gotten quotes from my manufacturer and was finally ready to order the big batch. I waited months for product to arrive. The accessories came first, since they were easiest to make. But finally by March, huge boxes began to show up at my door. Thousands of units of hardware were finally in hand. It was an incredible feeling!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly I had a new problem - I'd have to ship all of this stuff! When I ordered the first 1000 units, the manufacturer handled all the shipping. But when the new order came around the manufacturer said they no longer offer shipping services. I'd been working on getting ready for shipment for two and a half years, but it took so long I almost never imagined it would happen. I certainly wasn't prepared. But I did some research, found some nice shipping boxes (which were more expensive than I'd like, I should add) and got ready to ship out the first new orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I discovered a problem. A big problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flutter Wireless sells wireless boards - little programmable Arduino like boards with wireless radios on them. You can program the boards to talk to each other, so if you wanted to add sensors to your garden or make a remote control robot - Flutter would have you covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only I noticed that a bunch of the boards wouldn't talk to each other. Normally in any Flutter network you have one Master coordinator device that sets everything up, and then a bunch of slave devices that all synchronize with the master. But I found that I had a bunch of boards that would never synchronize to the master! It should be a pretty simple process - program one board as a master. Program another as a slave. Power on the master and the slave, and within two seconds the light on the slave flashes green to let you know it's connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well I had a bunch of boards that would never connect. The light flashed blue and red to tell me it wasn't connected. I started digging in to my software to figure out why this had happened. Eventually I discovered that different boards had different frequency offsets. Each board has a digital radio chip on it that sends and receives wireless signals. But wireless communications uses different frequencies to do different things and if two devices want to talk to each other they need to be using the same frequencies. On each board is a little device called a crystal that creates electrical vibrations at a very exact frequency. The software tells the radio chip what frequency to use and the radio chip uses the crystal as a reference to make sure the frequency is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's no such thing as a perfect crystal. The way they're manufactured determines how accurate they are. Cheaper crystals are less accurate than more expensive ones, as you'd expect. That's why the bill of materials for Flutter specifies a good quality crystal from a good manufacturer. We list one exact part number from one manufacturer as the part you're supposed to use. And after thorough inspection of my boards, I found that the manufacturer did not use the part I specified, but something else. I emailed pictures of the crystals to the real chip manufacturer and they confirmed - many of the crystals were fake clones and others were simply parts from a different manufacturer. I emailed the other manufacturer and they couldn't confirm the accuracy of the crystals I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flutter communicates using 20 kilohertz wide channels, and some of the crystals had 40 kilohertz of error. When two devices with bad crystals tried to talk, they'd be ever so slightly off - ultimately leaving them on the wrong frequency and totally unable to talk to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would take months to come up with a solution. We found that the errors in frequency did not change with time or temperature - the differences between units were up to manufacturing differences but whatever error they had would stay that way. There's also an onboard memory on each chip. I worked with a local wireless expert - Earl McCune - who had graciously been helping me on the tough parts of this project for quite some time. He had a super accurate wireless transmitter that we could use to calibrate my boards. So I took five radios and measured the error for each one. Then I programmed them to shift their frequencies just a little - so if one unit was 15 kilohertz too high, it would always subtract 15 kilohertz from the commanded signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I took my five adjusted boards home, and wrote software that would allow someone to take a box of hundreds of boards and quickly calibrate each unit with the same kind of offset. My chinese manufacturer had a local employee who lived in a nearby town, so I took my 3000 boards to her house, set her up with a computer and the calibration program, and she calibrated all 3000 units for me over a period of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FINALLY I was had the hardware I'd been working towards. It was now three years since the original campaign. The hardware worked, I just had to ship it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would eventually learn that shipping hardware is a pain too. I had about 1000 packages to ship, but the customers had all given me their addresses years before. The software I used to track customers was designed to take their address once, but I now needed them to update their addresses. I had no way of knowing who had done so and who hadn't, so I finally ended up manually emailing them to confirm addresses. I had given the customers a lot of kit options, and then to collect more money I had also given them the option to add in extras. This meant that while about 200 of the orders were the same, most orders had unique options and so had to be stuffed individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn't planned appropriately for shipping, and doing it myself was slow. I found that I could move maybe 20 packages a weekend, but it was slow constant work and I hated it. It would take a year of that work every weekend to ship everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I found a local shipping company that would mail out my product. They sent the first shipment around July of 2017, and they've now shipped hundreds of packages. I still have a few hundred more, but I can get 100 shipments set up in two weekends and then have a few weeks free to work on other parts of the businesses before they need more shipments again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I've started working on other improvements to the product. I added an important feature to the wireless protocol, and I translated the design files from an old design program to a newer open source program I now like to work in. I started working on this product over five years ago, and I'm still not done shipping product to the original backers. It has cost me almost $100,000 of my own money to do this, and I'm still paying off the debt. I had fantasies of investors swooping in with big paychecks so I could work out of a house in Palo Alto with a pool and a barbecue. Instead I found myself drinking to handle the stress of my funds running out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But fantasies aside, I had another more concrete goal. I didn't have any idea how to run a business, and I badly wanted to learn. I've wanted to start my own robotics company since I was 11 years old, and I still haven't done it. But I have run a successful Kickstarter campaign and raised $150,000 online. I have designed a really nice wireless board that works with Arduino software and has over 1 kilometer range. I started my own open source business and had over $80,000 worth of hardware manufactured in china. I learned the hard way that you need to be careful with your vendors or they'll substitute a critical part for something out of spec. I learned that you have to test your product as soon as it arrives, and not two months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also learned how much work it all is. I no longer want to sell 10 different kits with all kinds of add ons. I will never again make up my pricing and I will never price things that low. Remember the $20 price point I mentioned? I thought the boards would cost around $12, and I had hoped our $30 premium unit would help compensate for the low profits of the $20 units. But when all was said and done, those boards cost $19 to make. I did all that work to make no money. I'd later learn from some hardware experts that you really want to price goods like mine around 5x the cost to manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, I'd still like to do a Kickstarter again in the future. But I won't do it with a product that isn't designed yet. I'm going to design new products and fund them myself in small batches, selling them on Amazon. If the product works and people like it, then I can consider Kickstarter. And when I do it, there won't be multiple kit options. There will be a single shipping item. I'll already have a thorough test plan in place with documentation for my vendor to follow. If I do a Kickstarter again I'll be able to take the money, send it to the vendor, get tested hardware to my door, and then send it to Amazon for fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lost $100,000 over five years on my first halfway successful venture. But as far as I'm concerned, it's been a success. I had no idea what was going to happen when I started, but I knew I would learn. And learn I have. The business is still going and I still have people excited to use the product. I'm slowly building a brand I believe I can use for future products. I'm considering now a new product I might be able to start selling on Amazon in maybe a year's time under the Flutter brand. It's been in the works for a long time but after all the Kickstarter hardware is shipped I'm going to rebrand Flutter Wireless to Flutter Electronics. My dream is that we'll sell robotics kits. Maybe in another five years I'll get there. When I do, I'll finally have realized the dream I've had since I was 11 - to run my own robotics company.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>FoundationDB Document Layer</title>

<description>&lt;span class=&quot;published-date&quot;&gt;Published November 29, 2018&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we’re open sourcing the FoundationDB Document Layer, a document-oriented database that extends the core functionality of the FoundationDB key-value store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FoundationDB Document Layer provides the ease-of-use of a document database in the form of the familiar MongoDB® API. The Document Layer is a stateless server, backed by the scalable and transactional features of FoundationDB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Released under an Apache v2 license, the Document Layer project is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-document-layer&quot;&gt;hosted on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundationdb.org/download/#document-layer&quot;&gt;binary downloads&lt;/a&gt; are available for macOS and Linux. See the project documentation to get started, and we encourage your participation on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.foundationdb.org/c/document-layer&quot;&gt;new forum section for the Document Layer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mongodb-api-compatible&quot;&gt;MongoDB® API Compatible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For developers looking to use FoundationDB, the Document Layer has a familiar API, and is compatible with the MongoDB® protocol. In fact, simple applications leveraging MongoDB® can have a lift-and-shift migration to the Document Layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to connect your application to the Document Layer, you can use any existing MongoDB® client — making it easy to get started. A discussion of the features supported by Document Layer can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundationdb.github.io/fdb-document-layer/&quot;&gt;the project's documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;scalable-document-storage-with-foundationdb&quot;&gt;Scalable Document Storage with FoundationDB&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By extending FoundationDB, the Document Layer inherits key qualities of the core project — including years of testing, support for ACID transactions, and great performance. Using FoundationDB as a base for this stateless layer lets the Document Layer innovate in a number of notable ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No write locks: write operations, even on a single document, do not take locks. Transactions in FoundationDB are optimistic (lockless) and, by storing a document as multiple key-value pairs, the Document Layer supports many parallel writers. In some cases, operations may have to retry due to conflicts; however, non-conflicting operations, including metadata operations, can proceed in parallel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No sharding: The Document Layer does not rely on a fixed shard key to distribute data. Instead, all data partitioning and rebalancing is managed automatically by the key-value store. This design, directly inherited from FoundationDB, provides robust horizontal scalability while avoiding client-level complexity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy scaling: Each running instance of the Document Layer is a stateless application, configured only with the FoundationDB cluster to which it stores data. This stateless design means that many instances of Document Layer can be put behind a load balancer, all able to handle queries from any client and for any document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safe defaults: By default, write operations on the Document Layer execute with full isolation and atomicity. This consistency makes it easier to correctly implement applications that handle more than one simultaneous request. Indexes are always consistent with document data. Writes are fully consistent all the time irrespective of client selected options and, similarly, reads always see strong causal consistency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please see the documentation for more info about &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundationdb.github.io/fdb-document-layer/architecture.html&quot;&gt;the architecture of the Document Layer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-future-is-layers&quot;&gt;The Future is Layers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we first released FoundationDB we wrote in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foundationdb.org/blog/foundationdb-is-open-source/&quot;&gt;the original announcement&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vision of FoundationDB is to start with a simple, powerful core and extend it through the addition of “layers”. The key-value store, which is open sourced today, is the core, focused on incorporating only features that aren’t possible to write in layers. Layers extend that core by adding features to model specific types of data and handle their access patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FoundationDB key-value store is powerful but, as noted above, its features remain narrowly scoped to distributed transactions and stateful storage. The Document Layer takes the key-value store's focused API and uses it to model a much more complex style of data storage. Because the Document Layer exposes a new, general-purpose API we think of this as an extension to FoundationDB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key-value store of FoundationDB lacks a number of features you would expect of a full database system. For instance there are no indexes, no data typing, and no query engine. The Document Layer extends FoundationDB to add a number of such concepts. Take index maintenance: key-value store transactions are used to simultaneously update both a document's field and an index value that points back at the field. This is &lt;a href=&quot;https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/simple-indexes.html&quot;&gt;a common pattern&lt;/a&gt; for how simple indexes can be built. As an extension to FoundationDB, Document Layer makes this pattern available to clients in a robust and reusable manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could not be more excited to have the Document Layer as a community project! We're excited to see where we can take this together. Community collaboration does not need to end with the document model either — many other layers could be generally useful, written either as a library or a network server. The Document Layer should serve as a template for future layers both in design and in utility.&lt;/p&gt;

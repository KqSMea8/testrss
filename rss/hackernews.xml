<title>How America Uses Its Land</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-us-land-use/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-us-land-use/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Using surveys, satellite images and categorizations from various government agencies, the U.S. Department of Agriculture divides the U.S. into six major types of land. The data can’t be pinpointed to a city block—each square on the map represents 250,000 acres of land. But piecing the data together state-by-state can give a general sense of how U.S. land is used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gathered together, cropland would take up more than a fifth of the 48 contiguous states. Pasture and rangeland would cover most of the Western U.S., and all of the country’s cities and towns would fit neatly in the Northeast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though urban areas make up just 3.6 percent of the total size of the 48 contiguous states, four in five Americans live, work and play there. With so much of the U.S. population in urban areas, it’s little surprise that these areas contribute an outsize amount to the economy. The 10 most productive metropolitan areas alone contributed to about 40 percent of U.S. GDP in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is becoming more urban—at an average rate of about 1 million additional acres a year. That’s the equivalent of adding new urban area the size of Los Angeles, Houston and Phoenix combined. U.S. urban areas have more than quadrupled since 1945.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The USDA categorizes national parks, wildlife areas, highways, railroads and military bases as special-use areas. And another USDA land classification—miscellaneous—includes cemeteries, golf courses, marshes, deserts and other areas of “low economic value.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 100 million acres of special-use areas are park and wilderness areas, where most commercial activities, such as logging, mining and grazing, are excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agricultural land takes up about a fifth of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the actual land area used to grow the food Americans eat is much smaller—only about the size of Indiana, Illinois and half of Iowa combined. More than a third of the entire corn crop is devoted to ethanol production. Most cropland is used for livestock feed, exports or is left idle to let the land recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the U.S. benefits from an overall agricultural trade surplus, Americans imported 15 percent of their food and beverage products in 2016. More than 30 percent of the fresh fruits and vegetables Americans consume come from other countries, predominantly Mexico and Canada. The amount of U.S. land used to produce citrus fruits alone is larger than Rhode Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than one-third of U.S. land is used for pasture—by far the largest land-use type in the contiguous 48 states. And nearly 25 percent of that land is administered by the federal government, with most occurring in the West. That land is open to grazing for a fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a single, major occupant on all this land: cows. Between pastures and cropland used to produce feed, 41 percent of U.S. land in the contiguous states revolves around livestock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forestland is the last major category of land categorized by the USDA. Unprotected forests and timberland constitute a quarter of the contiguous U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the U.S. Forest Service, timber harvests typically occur on about 11 million acres each year. But because of regrowth, the volume of U.S. timber stock grew by about 1 percent annually from 2007 to 2012. Weyerhaeuser Co. is the largest private owner of timberlands in the U.S. With 12.4 million acres, the company controls 2.3 percent of all commercially available timber, an area nearly the size of West Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting all those pieces together, this map gives you a rough sense of all the ways U.S. land is used. Much of U.S. land serves specific purposes, such as the 2 million acres devoted to golf courses or the 3 million acres for airports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a percentage basis, urban creep outpaces growth in all other land-use categories. Another growth area: land owned by wealthy families. According to &lt;span&gt;The Land Report&lt;/span&gt; magazine, since 2008 the amount of land owned by the 100 largest private landowners has grown from 28 million acres to 40 million, an area larger than the state of Florida.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A bootable CD image with a retro game in a single tweet</title>
<link>https://www.quaxio.com/bootable_cd_retro_game_tweet/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.quaxio.com/bootable_cd_retro_game_tweet/</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.quaxio.com/files/2018/bootable_cd_retro_game_tweet/screenshot.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I crafted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quaxio.com/bootloader_retro_game_tweet/&quot;&gt;bootable floppy disk and a retro game&lt;/a&gt; which fit in a tweet. Since then, Twitter doubled the length of tweets, so I decided to handcraft a bootable CD. The bootable disk runs a slightly improved version of tron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
perl -E 'say&quot;A&quot;x46422,&quot;BDRDAwMQFFTCBUT1JJVE8gU1BFQ0lGSUNBVElPTg&quot;,&quot;A&quot;x54,&quot;Ew&quot;,&quot;A&quot;x2634,&quot;/0NEMDAxAQ&quot;,&quot;A&quot;x2721,&quot;BAAAAYQ&quot;,&quot;A&quot;x30,&quot;SVVVqogAAAAAAAEAF&quot;,&quot;A&quot;x2676,&quot;LMBaACgB76gfbgTAM0Qv8D4uYAI86qqgcc+AXP45GA8SHIRPFB3DTeYSEhyBSwCa8CwicMB3rSG/sHNFbRFJjAke9rrwQ&quot;,&quot;A&quot;x2638'|base64 -D&amp;gt;cd.iso
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;The code in the tweet creates a bootable CDROM disk image: &lt;code&gt;cd.iso&lt;/code&gt;. You can boot the code in qemu, virtual box or your favorite virtualization software and play the game with the arrow keys. You can even burn the iso to a blank CD and boot real hardware.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To handcraft a CD disk image, you must first get a basic understanding of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9660&quot;&gt;ISO 9660&lt;/a&gt;. ISO standards unfortunately are usually expensive. ISO 9660 is however the same as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quaxio.com/files/2018/bootable_cd_retro_game_tweet/ecma-119.pdf&quot;&gt;ECMA 119&lt;/a&gt;, which means you can read the specification for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISO 9660 has many extensions, such as UDF, El Torito, RockRidge, Joliet, etc. For bootable images, we only care about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quaxio.com/files/2018/bootable_cd_retro_game_tweet/el_torito.pdf&quot;&gt;El Torito&lt;/a&gt;. The El Torito specification is, in my opinion, poorly written. There are mistakes (e.g. figure 7, last row), it's easy to forget that values are hex (no &lt;code&gt;0x&lt;/code&gt; prefixes), the figures aren't sorted in an intuitive order, etc. Thankfully, the document is fairly short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a bootable disk, we start by writing 17 empty sectors followed by the Volume Descriptor Set. A sector is 2048 bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: The ISO-9660 specification says the Volume Descriptor Set starts at sector 16. The El Torito specification calls for the Boot Record to live at sector 17. Technically, we should put a dummy Volume Descriptor in sector 16, but things seem to work fine without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We write the first Volume Descriptor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
0x00                      // Type (0 = boot record)
'CD001'                   // Identifier
0x01                      // Version
'EL TORITO SPECIFICATION' // Boot System Identifier
9 x 0x00                  // Padding
32 x 0x00                 // Unused
0x13 0x00 0x00 0x00       // Boot Catalog address (in absolute sectors)
1973 x 0x00               // Unused
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next sector is the Volume Descriptor Set Terminator:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
0xff                      // Type (255 = terminator)
'CD001'                   // Identifier
0x01                      // Version
2041 x 0x00               // Unused
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Volume Descriptors are followed by the Boot Catalog. El Torito supports various emulation modes. The CD-ROM can emulate a bootable floppy, bootable harddrive, etc. I picked no emulation, which implies the BIOS will load a specific number of sectors and jump into our bootloader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The checksum is computed such that all 16-bit values in the record sum to 0 (mod 65536).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First entry in the Boot Catalog (Validation Entry):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
0x01                      // Header ID
0x00                      // Platform ID (0 = Intel x86)
0x00 0x00                 // Reserved
'a'                       // ID string
23 x 0x00                 // Padding
cksum cksum               // Checksum (2 bytes)
0x55 0xaa                 // Key bytes
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second entry (Default Entry):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
0x88                      // Boot Indicator (0x88 = bootable)
0x00                      // Boot Media Type (0 = no emulation)
0x00 0x00                 // Load segment
0x00                      // System Type
0x00                      // Unused
0x01 0x00                 // Number of sectors to load
0x14 0x00 0x00 0x00       // Virtual disk address (in absolute sectors)
20 x 0x00                 // Unused
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Followed by zeros until the end of the sector:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
1984 x 0x00               // Unused
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next sector is the bootloader / retro game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
; to compile:
; nasm bootloader.asm -o bootloader.img
          [bits 16]                    ; Pragma, tells the assembler that we

          ; We also assume that starting at the bottom and drawing 2176 pixels
          ; wraps around and ends up drawing the top + bottom borders.
          mov       di, 320*199

game_loop:
          ; We read the keyboard input from port 0x60. This also reads bytes from

          ; we use int 15h 86h instead. This also shaves a few bytes.

          ; Note: you'll have to tweak cx+dx if you are running this on a virtual

          jmp       restart_game

TIMES 2048 - ($ - $$) db 0             ; Fill the rest of the sector with 0
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then wrote a script to compile the bootloader, assemble the image, and generate the tweet. Finally, I burned a CD and tested that things work on real hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Bullshit Web</title>
<link>https://pxlnv.com/blog/bullshit-web/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://pxlnv.com/blog/bullshit-web/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;My home computer in 1998 had a 56K modem connected to our telephone line; we were allowed a maximum of thirty minutes of computer usage a day, because my parents — quite reasonably — did not want to have their telephone shut off for an evening at a time. I remember webpages loading slowly: ten to twenty seconds for a basic news article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, a few of my friends were getting cable internet. It was remarkable seeing the same pages load in just a few seconds, and I remember thinking about the kinds of the possibilities that would open up as the web kept getting faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And faster it got, of course. When I moved into my own apartment several years ago, I got to pick my plan and chose a massive fifty megabit per second broadband connection, which I have since upgraded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with an internet connection faster than I could have thought possible in the late 1990s, what’s the score now? A story at the &lt;em&gt;Hill&lt;/em&gt; took &lt;a href=&quot;https://d.pr/HElAyq&quot;&gt;over nine seconds&lt;/a&gt; to load; at &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://d.pr/PXrBhY&quot;&gt;seventeen seconds&lt;/a&gt;; at CNN, &lt;a href=&quot;https://d.pr/5R0EBL&quot;&gt;over thirty seconds&lt;/a&gt;. This is the bullshit web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, a short parenthetical: I’ve been writing posts in both long- and short-form about this stuff for a while, but I wanted to bring many threads together into a single document that may pretentiously be described as a &lt;em&gt;theory of&lt;/em&gt; or, more practically, a &lt;em&gt;guide to&lt;/em&gt; the bullshit web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second parenthetical: when I use the word “bullshit” in this article, it isn’t in a profane sense. It is much closer to Harry Frankfurt’s definition in “On Bullshit”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is just this lack of connection to a concern with truth — this indifference to how things really are — that I regard as of the essence of bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also intend it to be used in much the same sense as the way it is used in &lt;a href=&quot;http://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/&quot;&gt;David Graeber’s “On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs”&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;22&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the year 1930, John Maynard Keynes predicted that, by century’s end, technology would have advanced sufficiently that countries like Great Britain or the United States would have achieved a 15-hour work week. There’s every reason to believe he was right. In technological terms, we are quite capable of this. And yet it didn’t happen. Instead, technology has been marshaled, if anything, to figure out ways to make us all work more. In order to achieve this, jobs have had to be created that are, effectively, pointless. Huge swathes of people, in Europe and North America in particular, spend their entire working lives performing tasks they secretly believe do not really need to be performed. The moral and spiritual damage that comes from this situation is profound. It is a scar across our collective soul. Yet virtually no one talks about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are what I propose to call ‘bullshit jobs’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the equivalent on the web, then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average internet connection in the United States is about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/616210/average-internet-connection-speed-in-the-us/&quot;&gt;six times as fast&lt;/a&gt; as it was just ten years ago, but instead of making it faster to browse the same types of websites, we’re simply occupying that extra bandwidth with more &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt;. Some of this &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; is amazing: in 2006, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2006/09/12Apple-Announces-iTunes-7-with-Amazing-New-Features/&quot;&gt;Apple added movies to the iTunes Store&lt;/a&gt; that were 640 × 480 pixels, but you can now stream movies in HD resolution and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcworld.com/article/2146462/prepare-for-fake-4k-new-standard-will-silently-compress-pc-tablet-video.html&quot;&gt;(pretend) 4K&lt;/a&gt;. These much higher speeds also allow us to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2018/07/photos-of-the-week-pug-mugshot-umbrella-sky-helsinki-summit/565670/&quot;&gt;more detailed photos&lt;/a&gt;, and that’s very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a lot of the &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; we’re seeing is a pile-up of garbage on seemingly every major website that does nothing to make visitors happier — if anything, much of this stuff is deeply irritating and morally indefensible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/24/politics/michael-cohen-donald-trump-tape/index.html&quot;&gt;that CNN article&lt;/a&gt;, for example. Here’s what it contained when I loaded it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eleven web fonts, totalling 414 KB&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four stylesheets, totalling 315 KB&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty frames&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-nine XML HTTP requests, totalling about 500 KB&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately one hundred scripts, totalling several megabytes — though it’s hard to pin down the number and actual size because some of the scripts are “beacons” that load after the page is technically finished downloading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of these resources are not directly related to the information on the page, and I’m including advertising. Many of the scripts that were loaded are purely for surveillance purposes: self-hosted analytics, of which there are several examples; various third-party analytics firms like Salesforce, Chartbeat, and Optimizely; and social network sharing widgets. They churn through CPU cycles and cause my six-year-old computer to cry out in pain and fury. I’m not asking much of it; I have opened a text-based document on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, pretty much any CNN article page includes an autoplaying video, a tactic which has allowed them to brag about having the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/perlberg/status/1019968000458481664&quot;&gt;highest number of video starts&lt;/a&gt; in their category. I have no access to ComScore’s Media Metrix statistics, so I don’t know exactly how many of those millions of video starts were stopped instantly by either the visitor frantically pressing every button in the player until it goes away or just closing the tab in desperation, but I suspect it’s approximately every single one of them. People &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ezv8q4/why-is-autoplay-video-still-a-thing&quot;&gt;really hate&lt;/a&gt; autoplaying video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, have you noticed just how many websites desperately want you to sign up for their newsletter? While this is prevalent on so many news and blog websites, I’ve dragged them enough in this piece so far, so I’ll mix it up a bit: this is also &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; popular with retailers. From &lt;a href=&quot;https://d.pr/Xa0xzb&quot;&gt;Barnes &amp;amp; Noble&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://d.pr/FommHV&quot;&gt;Aritzia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://d.pr/R35Y5j&quot;&gt;Fluevog&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://d.pr/JRO6ES&quot;&gt;Linus Bicycles&lt;/a&gt;, these things are seemingly everywhere. &lt;em&gt;Get a nominal coupon in exchange for being sent an email you won’t read every day until forever&lt;/em&gt; — I don’t think so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are a bunch of elements that have become something of a standard with modern website design that, while not offensively intrusive, are often unnecessary. I appreciate great typography, but web fonts still load pretty slowly and cause the text to reflow midway through reading the first paragraph. And then there are those &lt;a href=&quot;https://pxlnv.com/linklog/not-every-article-needs-a-picture/&quot;&gt;gigantic full-width header images&lt;/a&gt; that dominate the top of every page, as though every two-hundred-word article on a news site was the equivalent of a magazine feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s the tip of the bullshit web. You know how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2014/06/wuwt-traffic-induced-demand/&quot;&gt;building wider roads doesn’t improve commute times&lt;/a&gt;, as it simply encourages people to drive more? It’s that, but with bytes and bandwidth instead of cars and lanes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Graeber &lt;a href=&quot;http://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/&quot;&gt;observed in his essay&lt;/a&gt; and book, bullshit jobs tend to spawn other bullshit jobs for which the sole function is a dependence on the existence of more senior bullshit jobs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And these numbers do not even reflect on all those people whose job is to provide administrative, technical, or security support for these industries, or for that matter the whole host of ancillary industries (dog-washers, all-night pizza delivery) that only exist because everyone else is spending so much of their time working in all the other ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, too, is the case with the bullshit web. The combination of huge images that serve little additional purpose than decoration, several scripts that track how far you scroll on a page, and dozens of scripts that are advertising related means that text-based webpages are now obese and torpid and excreting a casual contempt for visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the assumption that any additional bandwidth offered to web developers will immediately be consumed, there seems to be just one possible solution, which is to reduce the amount of bytes that are transmitted. For some bizarre reason, this hasn’t happened on the &lt;em&gt;main&lt;/em&gt; web, because it somehow makes more sense to create an exact copy of every page on their site that is expressly designed for speed. Welcome back, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Application_Protocol&quot;&gt;WAP&lt;/a&gt; — except, for some reason, this mobile-centric copy is entirely dependent on yet more bytes. This is the dumbfoundingly dumb premise of AMP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launched in February 2016, AMP is a collection of standard HTML elements and AMP-specific elements on a special ostensibly-lightweight page that needs an 80 kilobyte JavaScript file to load correctly. Let me explain: HTML5 allows custom elements like AMP’s &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;amp-img&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, but will render them as &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements without any additional direction — provided, in AMP’s case, by its mandatory JavaScript file. This large script is also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ampproject.org/docs/fundamentals/spec#the-amp-html-format&quot;&gt;required by the AMP spec&lt;/a&gt; to be hotlinked from &lt;code&gt;cdn.amp-project.org&lt;/code&gt;, which is a Google-owned domain. That makes an AMP website dependent on Google to display its basic markup, which is super weird for a platform as open as the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That belies the reason AMP has taken off. It isn’t necessarily because AMP pages are better for users, though that’s absolutely a consideration, but because Google &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; it to be popular. When you search Google for anything remotely related to current events, you’ll see only AMP pages in the news carousel that sits above typical search results. You’ll also see AMP links crowding the first results page, too. Google has openly admitted that they promote AMP pages in their results and that the carousel is restricted to only AMP links on their mobile results page. They insist that this is because AMP pages are faster and, therefore, better for users, but that’s not a complete explanation for three reasons: AMP pages aren’t inherently faster than non-AMP pages, high-performing non-AMP pages are not mixed with AMP versions, and Google has a conflict of interest in promoting the format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems ridiculous to argue that AMP pages aren’t actually faster than their plain HTML counterparts because it’s so easy to see these pages are actually very fast. And there’s a good reason for that. It isn’t that there’s some sort of special sauce that is being done with the AMP format, or some brilliant piece of programmatic rearchitecting. No, it’s just because AMP restricts the kinds of elements that can be used on a page and severely limits the scripts that can be used. That means that webpages can’t be littered with arbitrary and numerous tracking and advertiser scripts, and that, of course, leads to a dramatically faster page. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://timkadlec.com/remembers/2018-03-19-how-fast-is-amp-really/&quot;&gt;series of experiments by Tim Kadlec&lt;/a&gt; showed the effect of these limitations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMP’s biggest advantage isn’t the library — you can beat that on your own. It isn’t the AMP cache — you can get many of those optimizations through a good build script, and all of them through a decent CDN provider. That’s not to say there aren’t some really smart things happening in the AMP JS library or the cache — there are. It’s just not what makes the biggest difference from a performance perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMP’s biggest advantage is the restrictions it draws on how much &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; you can cram into a single page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMP’s restrictions mean less stuff. It’s a concession publishers are willing to make in exchange for the enhanced distribution Google provides, but that they hesitate to make for their canonical versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: if you have a reasonably fast host and don’t litter your page with scripts, you, too, can have AMP-like results without creating a copy of your site dependent on Google and their slow crawl to gain control over the infrastructure of the web. But you can’t get into Google’s special promoted slots for AMP websites for reasons that are almost certainly driven by self-interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a cumulative effect of bullshit; its depth &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; breadth is especially profound. In isolation, the few seconds that it takes to load some extra piece of surveillance JavaScript isn’t much. Neither is the time it takes for a user to hide an email subscription box, or pause an autoplaying video. But these actions compound on a single webpage, and then again across multiple websites, and those seemingly-small time increments become a swirling miasma of frustration and pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s key to recognize, though, that this is a choice, a responsibility, and — ultimately — a matter of respect. Let us return to Graeber’s explanation of bullshit jobs, and his observation that we often experience fifteen-hour work weeks while at the office for forty. Much of the same is true on the web: there is the capability for pages to load in a second or two, but it has instead been used to spy on users’ browsing habits, make them miserable, and inundate them on other websites and in their inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Frankfurt’s definition — that the essence of bullshit is an indifference to the way things really are — that’s manifested in the hand-wavey treatment of the actual problems of the web in favour of dishonest pseudo-solutions like AMP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An actual solution recognizes that this bullshit is inexcusable. It is making the web a cumulatively awful place to be. Behind closed doors, those in the advertising and marketing industry can be pretty lucid about how much they also hate surveillance scripts and how awful they find these methods, while simultaneously encouraging their use. Meanwhile, users are increasingly taking matters into their own hands — the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Images/infographics/technologymediatelecommunications/gx-deloitte-tmt-2018-adblocking-media-report.pdf&quot;&gt;use of ad blockers is rising&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiday.com/media/mobile-ad-blocking-becoming-bigger-threat/&quot;&gt;across the board&lt;/a&gt;, many of which also block tracking scripts and other disrespectful behaviours. Users are making that choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They shouldn’t have to. Better choices should be made by web developers to not ship this bullshit in the first place. We wouldn’t tolerate such intrusive behaviour more generally; why are we expected to find it acceptable on the web?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An honest web is one in which the overwhelming majority of the code and assets downloaded to a user’s computer are used in a page’s visual presentation, with nearly all the remainder used to define the semantic structure and associated metadata on the page. Bullshit — in the form of CPU-sucking surveillance, unnecessarily-interruptive elements, and behaviours that nobody responsible for a website would themselves find appealing as a visitor — is unwelcome and intolerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death to the bullshit web.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Teenager Finds Classical Alternative to Quantum Recommendation Algorithm</title>
<link>https://www.quantamagazine.org/teenager-finds-classical-alternative-to-quantum-recommendation-algorithm-20180731/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.quantamagazine.org/teenager-finds-classical-alternative-to-quantum-recommendation-algorithm-20180731/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A teenager from Texas has taken quantum computing down a notch. In a paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04271&quot;&gt;posted online&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, 18-year-old Ewin Tang proved that ordinary computers can solve an important computing problem with performance potentially &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-computers-struggle-against-classical-algorithms-20180201/&quot;&gt;comparable to that of a quantum computer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its most practical form, the “recommendation problem” relates to how services like Amazon and Netflix determine which products you might like to try. Computer scientists had considered it to be one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/job-one-for-quantum-computers-boost-artificial-intelligence-20180129/&quot;&gt;best examples of a problem&lt;/a&gt; that’s exponentially faster to solve on quantum computers — making it an important validation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-era-of-quantum-computing-is-here-outlook-cloudy-20180124/&quot;&gt;the power of these futuristic machines&lt;/a&gt;. Now Tang has stripped that validation away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This was one of the most definitive examples of a quantum speedup, and it’s no longer there,” said Tang, who graduated from the University of Texas, Austin, in spring and will begin a Ph.D. at the University of Washington in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, at age 14 and after skipping the fourth through sixth grades, Tang enrolled at UT Austin and majored in mathematics and computer science. In the spring of 2017 Tang took a class on quantum information taught by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scottaaronson.com/&quot;&gt;Scott Aaronson&lt;/a&gt;, a prominent researcher in quantum computing. Aaronson recognized Tang as an unusually talented student and offered himself as adviser on an independent research project. Aaronson gave Tang a handful of problems to choose from, including the recommendation problem. Tang chose it somewhat reluctantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was hesitant because it seemed like a hard problem when I looked at it, but it was the easiest of the problems he gave me,” Tang said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recommendation problem is designed to give a recommendation for products that users will like. Consider the case of Netflix. It knows what films you’ve watched. It knows what all of its other millions of users have watched. Given this information, what are you likely to want to watch next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can think of this data as being arranged in a giant grid, or matrix, with movies listed across the top, users listed down the side, and values at points in the grid quantifying whether, or to what extent, each user likes each film. A good algorithm would generate recommendations by quickly and accurately recognizing similarities between movies and users and filling in the blanks in the matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016 the computer scientists &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irif.fr/~jkeren/jkeren/Iordanis_Kerenidis.html&quot;&gt;Iordanis Kerenidis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://simons.berkeley.edu/people/anupam-prakash&quot;&gt;Anupam Prakash&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08675&quot;&gt;published a quantum algorithm&lt;/a&gt; that solved the recommendation problem exponentially faster than any known classical algorithm. They achieved this quantum speedup in part by simplifying the problem: Instead of filling out the entire matrix and identifying the single best product to recommend, they developed a way of sorting users into a small number of categories — do they like blockbusters or indie films? — and sampling the existing data in order to generate a recommendation that was simply good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of Kerenidis and Prakash’s work, there were only a few examples of problems that quantum computers seemed to be able to solve exponentially faster than classical computers. Most of those examples were specialized — they were narrow problems designed to play to the strengths of quantum computers (these include the “forrelation” problem &lt;em&gt;Quanta&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/finally-a-problem-that-only-quantum-computers-will-ever-be-able-to-solve-20180621/&quot;&gt;covered earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;). Kerenidis and Prakash’s result was exciting because it provided a real-world problem people cared about where quantum computers outperformed classical ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To my sense it was one of the first examples in machine learning and big data where we showed quantum computers can do something that we still don’t know how to do classically,” said Kerenidis, a computer scientist at the Research Institute on the Foundations of Computer Science in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerenidis and Prakash proved that a quantum computer could solve the recommendation problem exponentially faster than any known algorithm, but they didn’t prove that a fast classical algorithm couldn’t exist. So when Aaronson began working with Tang in 2017, that was the question he posed — prove there is no fast classical recommendation algorithm, and thereby confirm Kerenidis and Prakash’s quantum speedup is real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That seemed to me like an important ‘t’ to cross to complete this story,” said Aaronson, who believed at the time that no fast classical algorithm existed.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Light painting animations directly from Blender</title>
<link>https://hackaday.com/2018/07/30/light-painting-animations-directly-from-blender</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://hackaday.com/2018/07/30/light-painting-animations-directly-from-blender</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Light painting: there’s something that never gets old about waving lights around in a long exposure photo. Whilst most light paintings are single shots, some artists painstakingly create frame-by-frame animations. This is pretty hard to do when moving a light around by hand: it’s mostly guesswork, as it’s difficult to see the results of your efforts until after the photo has been taken. But what if you could make the patterns really precise? What if you could model them in 3D?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Josh Sheldon] has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1bY66X1JKA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;done just that&lt;/a&gt;, by creating a process which allows animations formed in Blender to be traced out in 3D as light paintings. An animation is created in Blender then each frame is automatically exported and traced out by an RGB LED on a 3D gantry. This project is the culmination of a lot of software, electronic and mechanical work, all coming together under tight tolerances, and [Josh]’s skill really shines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;318409&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://hackaday.com/2018/07/30/light-painting-animations-directly-from-blender/signalflow/&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/signalflow.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;2117,1161&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;SignalFlow&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/signalflow.png?w=400&amp;amp;h=219&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/signalflow.png?w=800&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-318409&quot; src=&quot;https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/signalflow.png?w=400&amp;amp;h=219&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;219&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/signalflow.png?w=400&amp;amp;h=219 400w, https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/signalflow.png?w=800&amp;amp;h=438 800w, https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/signalflow.png?w=250&amp;amp;h=137 250w, https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/signalflow.png?w=768&amp;amp;h=421 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step was to export the animations out of Blender. Thanks to its open source nature, Python Blender add-ons were written to create light paths and convert them into an efficient sequence that could be executed by the hardware. To accommodate smooth sliding camera movements during the animation, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Defaultio/BlenderMoco/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;motion controller add-on was also written&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gantry which carried the main LED was hand-made. We’d have been tempted to buy a 3D printer and hack it for this purpose, but [Josh] did a fantastic job on the mechanical build, gaining a solidly constructed gantry with a large range. The driver electronics were also slickly executed, with custom rack-mount units created to integrate with the DragonFrame controller used for the animation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video ends on a call to action: due to moving out, [Josh] was unable to continue the project but has done much of the necessary legwork. We’d love to see this project continued, and it has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Defaultio/LightPaintingMachine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;documented for anyone who wishes to do so.&lt;/a&gt; If you want to check out more of [Josh]’s work, we’ve previously written about that time he made an &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackaday.com/2017/09/19/music-box-plays-still-alive-thanks-to-automated-hole-puncher/&quot;&gt;automatic hole puncher for music box spools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the tip, [Nick].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share this story&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
Two men and a woman have &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5eVZIVr8dk9N08wdXp3MlRpamNjOFBlRHNCd0JyaVJzY1M4/view?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;sued&lt;/a&gt; SolarCity, and its parent company, Tesla, alleging serious corporate misbehavior.
&lt;p&gt;The former retail employees claim that SolarCity tacitly approved the creation of &quot;fake sales accounts,&quot; resulting in &quot;unjustified bonuses&quot; for some employees and the basis of an &quot;unreasonably high valuation of SolarCity&quot; for investors. The automaker &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/11/tesla-and-solarcity-shareholders-approve-2-6-billion-merger/&quot;&gt;acquired&lt;/a&gt; SolarCity in late 2016 for $2.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the plaintiffs said they faced rampant harassment, discrimination, and inadequate overtime pay during their near-one-year tenure ending in mid-2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla did not respond to Ars’ request for comment on Sunday, but did respond on Tuesday (see update below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lead plaintiff in the case, Andrew Staples, who is gay, also alleged that he was &quot;repeatedly and continuously harassed&quot; by a supervisor from another department, Grant Katzenellenbogen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Specifically, this supervising employee continuously harassed Plaintiff Staples by calling him things like 'bitch,’ 'pussy' and 'faggot,’&quot; his lawyers wrote. &quot;These comments were made to Staples on numerous different days throughout his employment.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the civil lawsuit filed last Wednesday in San Diego County Superior Court, Staples reported the insults and the questionable corporate practices to various managers, including to CEO Elon Musk himself, who seemingly took no action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staples was then terminated from his position at the end of May 2017, which he believes was retaliation for his complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another man, Robert Ray, claims that he was subjected to age discrimination when he was fired—at the age of 59. The claims of the woman, Anquetta White, were not fully explained in court filings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three plaintiffs (Staples, Ray, and White) claim that when they attempted to inform management of these incidents, they were ultimately fired, which they argued contravened &lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&amp;amp;sectionNum=1102.5&quot;&gt;California’s whistleblower protection laws&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, they claim that they were &quot;not paid for all hours worked,&quot; including unpaid overtime hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not clear whether these firings were related to a wave of &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/10/report-tesla-fires-hundreds-more-workers-in-its-solarcity-unit/&quot;&gt;1,200 SolarCity job cuts in October 2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No sugar?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
A person with knowledge of the lawsuit who used to work in the San Diego office said that &quot;thousands&quot; of bogus SolarCity accounts may have been created by supposedly requesting solar panels for homes that turned out not to exist. Sometimes, these faux deals would be a valid residence but with a fake property owner's name—the real person did not intend to move ahead with solar panels.
&lt;p&gt;This tactic allegedly resulted, this person said, in at millions of dollars in phantom revenue. He added that more than a dozen people reported the practice to the relevant human resources representatives, and CEO Elon Musk himself, who never replied. Ars granted anonymity as this person feared reprisal from Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This former San Diego employee also said that, despite working for a high-tech energy company, the SolarCity office, just south of the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, operated more like a struggling startup, with electrical plugins that didn't work, spotty office lighting, and even cutting back on sugar and creamer for the shared office coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Everything else behind the scenes was just crap,&quot; he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Michael Beardsley, a former Tesla employee who said he was &quot;witness&quot; to much of the allegations outlined in the lawsuit, confirmed the ex-employees' allegations. Beardsley, who is not named in the lawsuit, provided copies of emails that Staples sent to Tesla HR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I really appreciate you taking the time and effort,&quot; Staples wrote on April 14, 2017. &quot;I have voiced my concerns in the past to management, but I haven’t received a response and the seemingly unethical behavior by some on the team hasn’t changed. I can put up with a lot, but to have people that I’m mentoring become frustrated, and some who have come to me in tears over these issues and others disturbs me. I’m concerned that those who are truly putting in the effort and who are upstanding individuals are becoming disheartened.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Beardsley explained, they were sent &quot;incendiary pictures, memes and even pictures of female employees in their panties, etc.&quot; It is not clear under what circumstances such pictures were taken or obtained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beardsley provided Ars with an example of a picture of someone he said was a female colleague dressed in what appears to be a bra and underwear running on a lawn at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Diego ex-employee, who corroborated receiving that same picture from a different female colleague, was dismayed by what he called &quot;frat boy locker room crap.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’ve never worked in an environment this unprofessional,&quot; he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla has faced &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/10/former-workers-at-tesla-factory-sue-over-alleged-racial-harassment/&quot;&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/03/tesla-worker-claims-company-did-little-to-halt-racial-sexual-harassment/&quot;&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; by factory workers who alleged racial and sexual harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE 1:23pm ET: &lt;/strong&gt;Kamran Mumtaz, a Tesla spokesman, sent Ars a lengthy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4623390-Ars-Technica-Mail-Story-on-SolarCity.html&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the company denying that SolarCity or Tesla engaged in any retribution towards the three people in the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The plaintiffs’ roles were eliminated last year when, as part of Tesla’s integration with SolarCity, we decided to close our door-to-door sales channel for energy products—a decision that was announced publicly and covered extensively in the media—and the suggestion that they were eliminated for any other reason is false,&quot; the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;During his time at SolarCity, Mr. Staples never once raised concerns about discrimination or harassment over his sexual orientation. He and Ms. White did make claims about other issues, and these claims were fully investigated and responded to, not ignored.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla provided a copy of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4623360-Final-Staples-Investigation-Conclusion-Letter.html&quot;&gt;two-page formal response&lt;/a&gt; to Staples' allegations, which concluded that there were no improprieties. Similarly, the company also provided a copy of its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4623359-Final-White-Investigation-Conclusion-Letter.html&quot;&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; to White's claims, which found: &quot;our records indicate you were paid on time during your employment with SolarCity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the underwear photo, the company continued:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Staples and a coworker were found to have each sent inappropriate text messages to the other. Notably, the photo that Mr. Staples complained about was from a different coworkers’ Facebook public profile, that coworker stated that she had no issue with it, and Mr. Staples similarly told us that at the time it was sent to him, he had no issue with it either. Rather, he raised his concern only after he had a falling out with the coworker who sent it to him, as they previously had been close personal friends. The investigation also revealed that Mr. Staples sent numerous sexually suggestive texts of his own to this same coworker, including partially nude picture of another individual and a sexual video involving another employee. SolarCity provided formal warnings to all involved that this was not acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Staples never claimed that his supervisor engaged in sexual orientation harassment of any kind. Claims were made that both Mr. Staples and the supervisor were rude toward one another, but nothing about sexual orientation or the like was ever alleged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla is absolutely against any form of discrimination, harassment, or unfair treatment of any kind by or against anyone, and we take any concerns raised by employees very seriously, as we did here. In this case, the facts simply don’t support the plaintiffs’ story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<title>Evolving Floorplans</title>
<link>http://www.joelsimon.net/evo_floorplans.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.joelsimon.net/evo_floorplans.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Evolving Floor Plans is an experimental research project exploring speculative, optimized floor plan layouts. The rooms and expected flow of people are given to a genetic algorithm which attempts to optimize the layout to minimize walking time, the use of hallways, etc. The creative goal is to approach floor plan design solely from the perspective of optimization and without regard for convention, constructability, etc. The research goal is to see how a combination of explicit, implicit and emergent methods allow floor plans of high complexity to evolve. The floorplan is 'grown' from its genetic encoding using indirect methods such as graph contraction and emergent ones such as growing hallways using an ant-colony inspired algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were biological in appearance, intriguing in character and wildly irrational in practice. It was a fun learning experience and I plan to re-use methods in other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Original layout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.joelsimon.net/imgs/evo_plans/results_top.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;The original elementary school. Found somewhere in Maine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'Optimized'&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.joelsimon.net/imgs/evo_plans/results_bottom.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;Left: Optimized for minimizing traffic flow bewteen classes and material usage. Right: Also optimized for minimizing fire escape paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Windows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.joelsimon.net/imgs/evo_plans/windows2x2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows were also experimented with as an additional fitness function. Classrooms had a higher priority than storage rooms. This led to many interioir courtyards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A central challenge of spatial design problems is optimizing the relative positions, shapes and sizes of forms. Within architectural design, the layout of rooms is an early stage of the design process that is guided by multiple competing objective and subjective measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent computational tools that model the simulation of traffic, acoustics and heat conservation, among others, are allowing a more quantitative objective evaluation of forms. Converging with those abilities are advances in manufacturing, including CNC milling, on-site 3D printing, self-assembling structures and others, which are enabling new and more complex possible forms for which there are no simple means of designing. New tools for managing this complexity can empower designers to explore and optimize the increasingly high dimensional fitness spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two simulations, graph-contraction and ant-colony pathing, are used as 'growth processes'. Graph contraction is a family of algorithms that aim to create visually appealing layouts of a graphs. Ant-colony algorithms are probabilistic methods for finding optimal paths using a hive of emergent agents. Attribute genes encode meta-parameters that control various aspects of the simulations. This is analogous to developmental genes that establish patterns and guide development. Instead of encoding every path of all the hallways, a few attribute genes can optimize the entire layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The floor plan genome is a weighted, connected and undirected graph. Every desired room is represented with a node gene that contains information such as the room's size. Connection genes specify two node genes to span as well as a randomly initialized weight; they are added in a random manner until the graph is connected. Adjacency requirements create a subgraph with maximum edge weight. For example, the cafeteria must be adjacent to the kitchen. The genetic encoding is a generalization of NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) that allows the artificial evolution of neural networks to graphs. This applies historical markers to allow crossover of graphs with varying topology. This allows floor plans to differ in the number of rooms they have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Genotype To Phenotype Mapping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mapping process from genome to phenotype is done in four parts. First, each node in the graph is arranged with a spectral layout to an intermediary position (figure 1a). Second, a physics simulation maps the intermediate positions to final coordinates that are the center of that room in the floor plan (figure 1b). Third, the room centers are converted into a polygonal mesh representing the walls (figure 1c, 1d). Fourth, the hallways are created along the edges of the mesh, and then pruned and finalized using an algorithm inspired by ant-colonies behavior and converted into a final geometry (figure 1e, 1f).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mapping Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.joelsimon.net/imgs/evo_plans/overview_figure.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1:&lt;/strong&gt; The complete mapping process. a) The initial physics simulation using a spectral layout as input. b) The final result of the physics simulation. c) The concave hull of points (red) has been inflated to produce boundary Voronoi seeds (purple circles). d) The Voronoi tessellation creates geometry mesh. e) The floor plan with interior edges added and results of the hallway algorithm drawn in yellow. f) The final floor plan phenotype. Hallways are merged into a final geometry and interior edges used for door placement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hallways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.joelsimon.net/imgs/evo_plans/hallway_process.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2:&lt;/strong&gt; A representational overview of the hallway generation process. a) The mesh representation of a floor plan phenotype with three rooms. b) The creation of interior nodes and edges shown as hollow circles and dotted lines. c) The initial results of the OHP. Selected edges drawn in red. d) Smoothing of hallways by moving hallway vertices halfway to their projection onto the segment formed by neighbors. e) Creation of hallway geometry by using outer tangent lines of circles with radius proportional to travel load. f) The final hallway geometry with doors placed from interior edges with travel loads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A direction of work specific to schools is the mutual evolution of students' class schedules and floor plan layout. This would allow a unified optimization process of the entire school day experience. Genetic algorithms are already currently applied to optimal scheduling problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metrics could be expanded to include terrain maps, sun paths, existing trees and other environmental input, allowing the buildings to be highly adaptive to their context. The physics simulation could force certain boundary shape constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The method could be evaluated with other applications such as office layouts or hospitals. Hospitals could minimize critical routes such as between surgery and pathology labs or between nurses' rooms and patients. Office plans could aim to minimize acoustical problems, a common issue in open offices, or to minimize walking paths, while also maximizing the percentage of walking paths that are shared with employees from other departments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have very mixed feelings about this project. It was my first large generative design project, and I think the underlying ideas have a lot of potential. The work required for all the various steps is probably overly complicated. By not obeying any laws of architecture or design, it also made the results very hard to evaluate. I hope it elicits some ideas in the reader about the future of generativity and design.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Robert —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early to mid-90s my hobby was making video games of various sorts with my friend Jesse. Our tools were &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game-Maker&quot;&gt;Recreational Software Designs Game-Maker 2.0&lt;/a&gt; and your creation &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaintShop_Pro&quot;&gt;JASC Paint Shop Pro&lt;/a&gt; (PSP). I discovered both in a software mail order catalog and purchased them with my lawn mowing cash. We used PSP to design our title screens mostly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had purchased the shareware version of PSP, which came with a 30-day trial period. I discovered that if I simply uninstalled and reinstalled PSP, we would get another 30-days of free use. But, my conscience didn’t feel good about my discovery. It was stealing–plain and simple. I sent JASC a brief letter explaining how we were using PSP and asking for permission to continue using it. I figured, the worst that could happen is that you could say “no” and I would have to save up to buy the full version. The best that could happen is that you would say “yes” and we would be back in business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my shock and surprise, you sent me the following reply:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You included a boxed version of PSP with your letter. I couldn’t have been more surprised or excited. It’s still one of my favorite childhood memories to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a year or two later, Jesse and I stopped making our games. The limitations of Game-Maker were quite real, and something bigger had arrived: The World Wide Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quickly taught myself HTML and continued to use PSP as my image editor–even later paying for upgraded versions. (Version 6 was my favorite!) I made websites on top of lawn mowing to earn cash throughout high school and college, which helped pay for school. The experience set me up to be a career website and web app builder (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://issuu.com/jeabx/docs/pc_world&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC World&lt;/em&gt;, September 2006, page 37&lt;/a&gt;). I couldn’t have done it without PSP. And I always liked it better than Adobe Photoshop, which I got to use during a few summer jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your kindness taught me three things: honesty and hard work &lt;strong&gt;are&lt;/strong&gt; rewarding–both spiritually and materially–and that it’s fun to surprise and delight and help those whom you can. It was no surprise to me years later to learn that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/corel-buys-photo-software-maker-jasc/&quot;&gt;JASC was acquired by Corel&lt;/a&gt;. Your life’s hard work, honesty, and kindness rewarded you, and I couldn’t have been happier for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for teaching me some valuable lessons and your gift that summer. I’m grateful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Jesse and I never officially shipped a game to market, I dug up one of them for old time’s sake and to finally follow through on my end of the deal. Here’s a video of &lt;em&gt;Xylon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>Robert — In the early to mid-90s my hobby was making video games of various sorts with my friend Jesse. Our tools were Recreational Software Designs Game-Maker 2.0 and your creation JASC Pain…</og:description>

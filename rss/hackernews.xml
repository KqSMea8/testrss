<title>Serious Intel CPU bugs (2016)</title>

<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;/&gt;&lt;title&gt;We saw some really bad Intel CPU bugs in 2015, and we should expect to see more in the future&lt;/title&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width,initial-scale=1&quot;/&gt;&lt;link rel=&quot;icon&quot; href=&quot;data:;base64,iVBORw0KGgo=&quot;/&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;213.47325498575&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We saw some really bad Intel CPU bugs in 2015, and we should expect to see more in the future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;2015 was a pretty good year for Intel. Their quarterly earnings reports exceeded expectations every quarter. They continue to be the only game in town for the serious server market, which continues to grow exponentially; from the earnings reports of the two largest cloud vendors, we can see that AWS and Azure grew by 80% and 100%, respectively. That growth has effectively offset the damage Intel has seen from the continued decline of the desktop market. For a while, it looked like &lt;a href=&quot;https://danluu.com/new-cpu-features/#update&quot;&gt;cloud vendors might be able to avoid the Intel tax by moving their computation onto FPGAs&lt;/a&gt;, but Intel bought one of the two serious FPGA vendors and, combined with their fab advantage, they look well positioned to dominate the high-end FPGA market the same way they’ve been dominating the high-end server CPU market. Also, their fine for anti-competitive practices turned out to be $1.45B, much less than the benefit they gained from their anti-competitive practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things haven’t looked so great on the engineering/bugs side of things, though. I don’t keep track of Intel bugs unless they’re so serious that people I know are scrambling to get a patch in because of the potential impact, and I still heard about two severe bugs this year in the last quarter of the year alone. First, there was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-156.html&quot;&gt;bug found by Ben Serebrin and Jan Beulic&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed a guest VM to fault in a way that would cause the CPU to hang in a microcode infinite loop, allowing any VM to DoS its host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major cloud vendors were quite lucky that this bug was found by a Google engineer, and that Google decided to share its knowledge of the bug with its competitors before publicly disclosing. Black hats spend a lot of time trying to take down major services. I’m actually really impressed by both the persistence and the cleverness of the people who spend their time attacking the companies I work for. If, buried deep in our infrastructure, we have a bit of code running at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_Procedure_Call&quot;&gt;DPC&lt;/a&gt; that’s vulnerable to slowdown because of some kind of hash collision, someone will find and exploit that, even if it takes a long and obscure sequence of events to make it happen. And they’ll often wait until an inconvenient time to start the attack, such as Christmas, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_Monday&quot;&gt;one of the big online shopping days&lt;/a&gt;. If this CPU microcode hang had been found by one of these black hats, there would have been major carnage for most cloud hosted services at the most inconvenient possible time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the Serebrin/Beulic bug was found, a group of people found that running &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mersenne.org/download/&quot;&gt;prime95&lt;/a&gt;, a commonly used tool for benchmarking and burn-in, causes &lt;a href=&quot;http://mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?t=20714&quot;&gt;their entire system to lock up&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://communities.intel.com/thread/96157?start=15&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;Intel’s response to this was&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel has identified an issue that potentially affects the 6th Gen Intel® Core™ family of products. This issue only occurs under certain complex workload conditions, like those that may be encountered when running applications like Prime95. In those cases, the processor may hang or cause unpredictable system behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which reveals almost nothing about what’s actually going on. If you look at their errata list, you’ll find that this is typical, except that they normally won’t even name the application that was used to trigger the bug. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/specification-updates/4th-gen-core-family-desktop-specification-update.pdf&quot;&gt;one of the current errata lists&lt;/a&gt; has entries like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Certain Combinations of AVX Instructions May Cause Unpredictable System Behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AVX Gather Instruction That Should Result in #DF May Cause Unexpected System Behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Processor May Experience a Spurious LLC-Related Machine Check During Periods of High Activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Page Fault May Report Incorrect Fault Information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we’ve seen, “unexpected system behavior” can mean that we’re completely screwed. Machine checks aren’t great either – they cause Windows to blue screen and Linux to kernel panic. An incorrect address on a page fault is potentially even worse than a mere crash, and if you dig through the list you can find a lot of other scary sounding bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And keep in mind that the Intel errata list has the following disclaimer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Errata remain in the specification update throughout the product’s lifecycle, or until a particular stepping is no longer commercially available. Under these circumstances, errata removed from the specification update are archived and available upon request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once they stop manufacturing a stepping (the hardware equivalent of a point release), they reserve the right to remove the errata and you won’t be able to find out what errata your older stepping has unless you’re important enough to Intel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to 2015. We’ve seen at least two serious bugs in Intel CPUs in the last quarter, and it’s almost certain there are more bugs lurking. Back when I worked at a company that produced Intel compatible CPUs, we did a fair amount of testing and characterization of Intel CPUs; as someone fresh out of school who’d previously assumed that CPUs basically worked, I was surprised by how many bugs we were able to find. Even though I never worked on the characterization and competitive analysis side of things, I still personally found multiple Intel CPU bugs just in the normal course of doing my job, poking around to verify things that seemed non-obvious to me. Turns out things that seem non-obvious to me are sometimes also non-obvious to Intel engineers. As more services move to the cloud and the impact of system hang and reset vulnerabilities increases, we’ll see more black hats investing time in finding CPU bugs. We should expect to see a lot more of these when people realize that it’s much easier than it seems to find these bugs. There was a time when a CPU family might only have one bug per year, with serious bugs happening once every few years, or even once a decade, but we’ve moved past that. In part, that’s because “unpredictable system behavior” have moved from being an annoying class of bugs that forces you to restart your computation to an attack vector that lets anyone with an AWS account attack random cloud-hosted services, but it’s mostly because CPUs &lt;a href=&quot;https://danluu.com/new-cpu-features/&quot;&gt;have gotten more complex, making them more difficult to test&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://danluu.com/cpu-backdoors/&quot;&gt;audit&lt;/a&gt; effectively, while Intel appears to be cutting back on validation effort. Ironically, we have hardware virtualization that’s supposed to help us with security, but the virtualization is so complicated that the hardware virtualization implementation is likely to expose “unpredictable system behavior” bugs that wouldn’t otherwise have existed. This isn’t to say it’s hopeless – it’s possible, in principle, to design CPUs such that a hang bug on one core doesn’t crash the entire system. It’s just that it’s a fair amount of work to do that at every level (cache directories, the uncore, etc., would have to be modified to operate when a core is hung, as well as OS schedulers). No one’s done the work because it hasn’t previously seemed important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;update&quot;&gt;Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After writing this, an ex-Intel employee said “even with your privileged access, you have no idea” and a pseudo-anonymous commenter on reddit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/41k3yx/we_saw_some_really_bad_intel_cpu_bugs_in_2015_and/cz2zwag&quot;&gt;made this comment&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who worked in an Intel Validation group for SOCs until mid-2014 or so I can tell you, yes, you will see more CPU bugs from Intel than you have in the past from the post-FDIV-bug era until recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me set the scene: It’s late in 2013. Intel is frantic about losing the mobile CPU wars to ARM. Meetings with all the validation groups. Head honcho in charge of Validation says something to the effect of: “We need to move faster. Validation at Intel is taking much longer than it does for our competition. We need to do whatever we can to reduce those times… we can’t live forever in the shadow of the early 90’s FDIV bug, we need to move on. Our competition is moving much faster than we are” - I’m paraphrasing. Many of the engineers in the room could remember the FDIV bug and the ensuing problems caused for Intel 20 years prior. Many of us were aghast that someone highly placed would suggest we needed to cut corners in validation - that wasn’t explicitly said, of course, but that was the implicit message. That meeting there in late 2013 signaled a sea change at Intel to many of us who were there. And it didn’t seem like it was going to be a good kind of sea change. Some of us chose to get out while the getting was good. As someone who worked in an Intel Validation group for SOCs until mid-2014 or so I can tell you, yes, you will see more CPU bugs from Intel than you have in the past from the post-FDIV-bug era until recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t been able to confirm this story from another source I personally know, although another anonymous commenter said “I left INTC in mid 2013. From validation. This … is accurate compared with my experience.” Another anonymous person, someone I know, didn’t hear that speech, but found that at around that time, “velocity” became a buzzword and management spent a lot of time talking about how Intel needs more “velocity” to compete with ARM, which appears to confirm the sentiment, if not the actual speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also heard from formal methods people that, around that time, there was an exodus of formal verification folks. One story I’ve heard is that people left because they were worried about being made redundant. I’m told that, at the time, early retirement packages were being floated around and people strongly suspected layoffs. Another story I’ve heard is that things got really strange due to Intel’s focus on the mobile battle with ARM, and people wanted to leave before things got even worse. But it’s hard to say of this means anything, since Intel has been losing a lot of people to Apple because Apple offers better compensation packages and the promise of being less dysfunctional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got anonymous stories about bugs. One person who works in HPC told me that when they were shopping for Haswell parts, a little bird told them that they’d see drastically reduced performance on variants with greater than 12 cores. When they tried building out both 12-core and 16-core systems, they found that they got noticeably better performance on their 12-core systems across a wide variety of workloads. That’s not better per-core performance – that’s better absolute performance. Adding 4 more cores reduced the performance on parallel workloads! That was true both in single-socket and two-socket benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/id-2830772/skylake-build-randomly-freezing-crashing.html&quot;&gt;a mysterious hang during idle/low-activity bug that Intel doesn’t seem to have figured out yet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103351&quot;&gt;this Broadwell bug that hangs Linux if you don’t disable low-power states&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course Intel isn’t the only company with bugs – this &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.debian.org/debian-security/2016/03/msg00084.html&quot;&gt;AMD bug found by Robert Swiecki&lt;/a&gt; not only allows a VM to crash its host, it also allows a VM to take over the host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt I’ve even heard of all the recent bugs and stories about verification/validation. Feel free to send other reports my way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;more-updates&quot;&gt;More updates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of folks have noticed &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.synology.com/enu/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;amp;t=119727&amp;amp;start=60&quot;&gt;unusual failure rates in storage devices&lt;/a&gt; and switches. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/intel-atom-c2000-series-bug-quiet/&quot;&gt;appears to be related to an Intel Atom bug&lt;/a&gt;. I find this interesting because the Atom is a relatively simple chip, and therefore a relatively simple chip to verify. When the first-gen Atom was released, folks at Intel seemed proud of how few internal spins of the chip were needed to ship a working production chip that, something made possible by the simplicity of the chip. Modern Atoms are more complicated, but not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel Skylake and Kaby Lake have &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2017/06/msg00308.html&quot;&gt;a hyperthreading bug that’s so serious that Debian recommends that users disable hyperthreading to avoid the bug&lt;/a&gt;, which can “cause spurious errors, such as application and system misbehavior, data corruption, and data loss”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the AMD side, there might be &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.amd.com/message/2796982&quot;&gt;a bug that’s as serious any recent Intel CPU bug&lt;/a&gt;. If you read that linked thread, you’ll see an AMD representative asking people to disable SMT, OPCache Control, and changing LLC settings to possibly mitigate or narrow down a serious crashing bug. On &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-1061546-postdays-0-postorder-asc-start-150.html&quot;&gt;another thread&lt;/a&gt;, you can find someone reporting an #MC exception with “u-op cache crc mismatch”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although AMD’s response in the forum was that these were isolated issues, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;amp;item=ryzen-segv-continues&quot;&gt;phoronix was able to reproduce crashes by running a stress test that consists of compiling a number of open source programs&lt;/a&gt;. They report they were able to get 53 segfaults with one hour of attempted compilation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some FreeBSD folks have also noticed seemingly unrelated crashes and have been able to get a reproduction by running code at a high address and then firing an interrupt. &lt;a href=&quot;https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;amp;revision=321899&quot;&gt;This can result in a hang or a crash&lt;/a&gt;. The reason this appears to be unrelated to the first reported Ryzen issues is that this is easily reproducible with SMT disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Dillon found an AMD bug triggered by DragonflyBSD, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://gitweb.dragonflybsd.org/dragonfly.git/commitdiff/b48dd28447fc8ef62fbc963accd301557fd9ac20&quot;&gt;commited a tiny patch to fix it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a bug in Ryzen related to the kernel iretq’ing into a high user %rip address near the end of the user address space (top of user stack). This is a temporary workaround for the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original %rip for sigtramp was 0x00007fffffffffe0. Moving it down to fa0 wasn’t sufficient. Moving it down to f00 moved the bug from nearly instant to taking a few hours to reproduce. Moving it down to be0 it took a day to reproduce. Moving it down to 0x00007ffffffffba0 (this commit) survived the overnight test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<title>NSA’s top talent is leaving because of low pay, flagging morale, unpopular reorg</title>
<link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/the-nsas-top-talent-is-leaving-because-of-low-pay-and-battered-morale/2018/01/02/ff19f0c6-ec04-11e7-9f92-10a2203f6c8d_story.html?utm_term=.0388eaf826c3</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/the-nsas-top-talent-is-leaving-because-of-low-pay-and-battered-morale/2018/01/02/ff19f0c6-ec04-11e7-9f92-10a2203f6c8d_story.html?utm_term=.0388eaf826c3</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The National Security Agency is losing its top talent at a worrisome rate as highly skilled personnel, some disillusioned with the spy service’s leadership and an unpopular reorganization, take higher-paying, more flexible jobs in the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2015, the NSA has lost several hundred hackers, engineers and data scientists, according to current and former U.S. officials with knowledge of the matter. The potential impact on national security is significant, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headquartered at Fort Meade in Maryland, the NSA employs a civilian workforce of about 21,000 there and is the largest producer of intelligence among the nation’s 17 spy agencies. The people who have left were responsible for collecting and analyzing the intelligence that goes into the president’s daily briefing. Their work also included monitoring a broad array of subjects including the Islamic State, Russian and North Korean hackers, and analyzing the intentions of foreign governments, and they were responsible for protecting the classified networks that carry such sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some synonym of the word ‘epidemic’ is the best way to describe it,” said Ellison Anne Williams, a former senior researcher at the NSA who left in 2016 to start her own data-security firm, Enveil. More than 10 of her employees also came from the NSA, she said. “The agency is losing an amazing amount of its strongest technical talent, and to lose your best and brightest staff is a huge hit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p channel=&quot;wp.com&quot; class=&quot;interstitial-link&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/departing-nsa-veterans-catch-the-eye-of-silicon-valley-investors/2017/11/12/ad5e8720-c61f-11e7-84bc-5e285c7f4512_story.html?utm_term=.b1ee60cffbf3&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;Departing NSA veterans catch the eye of Silicon Valley investors&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content inline-photo-left&quot;&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;unprocessed&quot; data-hi-res-src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1024w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/09/12/National-Security/Images/2016-09-08T180903Z_01_WAS502_RTRIDSP_3_USA-SECURITY.jpg?uuid=HnDuYHk0Eea9hre71T0rXQ&quot; data-low-res-src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_480w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/09/12/National-Security/Images/2016-09-08T180903Z_01_WAS502_RTRIDSP_3_USA-SECURITY.jpg?uuid=HnDuYHk0Eea9hre71T0rXQ&quot; data-raw-src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/09/12/National-Security/Images/2016-09-08T180903Z_01_WAS502_RTRIDSP_3_USA-SECURITY.jpg?uuid=HnDuYHk0Eea9hre71T0rXQ&quot; src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_480w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/09/12/National-Security/Images/2016-09-08T180903Z_01_WAS502_RTRIDSP_3_USA-SECURITY.jpg?uuid=HnDuYHk0Eea9hre71T0rXQ&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;National Security Agency Director Adm. Michael Rogers speaks during a national security conference in Washington in 2016. (Gary Cameron/Reuters)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NSA would not disclose how many job vacancies it has. Agency officials said there is a 5.6 percent attrition rate among personnel who specialize in science, technology and math. The attrition rate is closer to 8 or 9 percent among hackers and those who staff the agency’s always-operating watch center monitoring for cyber attacks, a trend that has spanned the Obama and Trump administrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;U12402093605118tjH&quot;&gt;Although the departure rates are low, compared with attrition levels in the civilian technology industry, and although the agency is filling its vacancies, most new personnel lack the experience of those who have left, said one senior intelligence official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer candid insights about the secretive organization. That experience deficit can impede the NSA’s core mission of collecting and analyzing the masses of data the agency lifts from foreign networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some groups within the NSA have lost almost half of their staffs, one former official said. As a result, projects ­to make intelligence collection more effective­ have been cut or slowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a turbulent moment in the NSA’s 65-year history. The agency continues to face public distrust after revelations, made by former contractor Edward Snowden in 2013, about the scope of its surveillance of American citizens. Morale dipped in the aftermath of those disclosures and has not fully recovered. More recently, the workforce was rattled by a series of breaches targeting the agency’s highly sensitive hacking tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p channel=&quot;wp.com&quot; class=&quot;interstitial-link&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/nsa-officials-worried-about-the-day-its-potent-hacking-tool-would-get-loose-then-it-did/2017/05/16/50670b16-3978-11e7-a058-ddbb23c75d82_story.html?utm_term=.a9899735887c&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;NSA officials worried about the day its potent hacking tool would get loose. Then it did.&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another source of frustration is an ongoing reorganization that has merged the NSA’s highly secret electronic spying mission with its more public network-defense operation, along with other changes. NSA Director Michael S. Rogers, a Navy admiral who also oversees the military’s Cyber Command, launched NSA 21 to break down what he called the “walls of granite” among divisions whose missions, he believed, complement one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former employees have voiced a variety of complaints. Some say they feel their missions have been marginalized by the restructuring. One called the reorganization “an enormous distraction” and lamented what he characterized as an inefficient procurement process that made it difficult to obtain even simple open-source developer tools. Another faulted the agency’s pay structure and promotion system, saying it favors seniority over skill and competence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content inline-video&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;inline-video-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;A federal contractor suspected in the leak of powerful National Security Agency hacking tools has been arrested and charged with stealing classified information from the U.S. government, according to court records and U.S. officials familiar with the case. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of breaches beginning with Snowden and including the arrest of former contractor Harold T. Martin III in 2016 have led to new security precautions. Such restrictions on accessing data have made work more difficult, and the internal hunt for would-be leakers has contributed to an environment of suspicion, said a number of current and former employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It comes down to death by a thousand cuts,” said a former employee, adding that people “tend to quit in packs. One person hits their breaking point, and once they leave, the dominoes start falling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p channel=&quot;wp.com&quot; class=&quot;interstitial-link&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-contractor-thought-to-have-taken-classified-material-the-old-fashioned-way/2016/10/12/ffc25e22-8cb1-11e6-875e-2c1bfe943b66_story.html?utm_term=.65d8c79bd67c&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;NSA contractor thought to have taken classified material the old-fashioned way&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain drain has been so pronounced that at one gathering in 2016 of the agency’s elite hacking division, one individual raised the concern with Rogers directly. According to several people familiar with the exchange, Rogers disputed that there was any increase in attrition and told his employees that they should stop complaining and get back to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An NSA spokesman, Tommy Groves, did not challenge the account, saying that employees’ concerns about high attrition rates have led to changes, including increased pay, increased promotions and greater opportunities to work at all NSA sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rogers did not respond to a request for comment. More recently, though, he has made it a point in public to thank the agency’s workforce and acknowledge the “cultural challenge” its employees face. At a national security conference in September, for instance, he said that dealing with “the great men and women of the organization” is “the best part of the day for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;U12402093605118IoF&quot;&gt;He added: “If the price of security becomes that we drive away the very men and women that generate value in the first place, we now have a self-induced mission kill.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rogers has told colleagues he plans to retire in the spring, ending a four-year tenure that has been rocky at times. At one point in 2016, the defense secretary and director of national intelligence wanted him removed over various leadership concerns. Rogers survived the episode, and with Trump’s national security team still settling in, he was seen as an element of continuity at the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not clear whom President Trump will nominate to succeed him, but whoever steps into the role will face a variety of challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“NSA is at this moment experiencing stress that is constant and unrelenting,” one former senior intelligence official said. He said the agency has weathered other high-anxiety periods “because there was cohesion in the workforce and a leader who could nurture them through it, if not inspire them. But this director hasn’t chosen to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skilled personnel have always left the NSA, in particular to work for defense contractors that support its work, said Deputy Director George Barnes, who has been at the agency for 31 years. “The big change these days is there’s a supply-demand imbalance between the outside and the inside,” he told The Washington Post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnes defended Rogers’s leadership and his handling of the reorganization. Rogers, he said, “is totally focused on ‘What’s the culture? How do we understand what causes stress?’ It’s the antithesis of the negative vibe” about which some employees complained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnes also noted the allure of Silicon Valley and other cities that tech start-ups call home. The U.S. private sector is struggling to fill more than 270,000 jobs in cybersecurity, according to Burning Glass Technologies, a labor analytics firm. Total compensation for those jobs can reach $200,000 or more, meaning even relatively junior cyber professionals in the industry can make more than top officials at the NSA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some senior officials say that the outflow in part reflects a cultural shift in which millennials are not inclined to stay in one workplace for an entire career. And it also stems from a disproportionate number of retirements of people who entered the agency in the 1980s during a hiring boom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other former NSA personnel who have left or retired recently expressed confidence that the NSA would weather the storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;U12402093605118jND&quot;&gt;“Yes, people will leave, but there are things you can do there that you can’t do anywhere else. It’s for God and country,” said Daniel Ennis, who oversaw the agency’s threat operations center before retiring in 2015 after 33 years. He now leads advanced cyberthreat intelligence for BlueteamGlobal, a private cybersecurity firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“NSA always recovers,” Ennis said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Spotify hit with $1.6B copyright lawsuit</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Music streaming company Spotify was sued by Wixen Music Publishing Inc last week for allegedly using thousands of songs, including those of Tom Petty, Neil Young and the Doors, without a license and compensation to the music publisher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wixen, an exclusive licensee of songs such as “Free Fallin” by Tom Petty, “Light My Fire” by the Doors, “(Girl We Got a) Good Thing” by Weezer and works of singers such as Stevie Nicks, is seeking damages worth at least $1.6 billion along with injunctive relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify failed to get a direct or a compulsory license from Wixen that would allow it to reproduce and distribute the songs, Wixen said in the lawsuit, filed in a California federal court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wixen also alleged that Spotify outsourced its work to a third party, licensing and royalty services provider the Harry Fox Agency, which was “ill-equipped to obtain all the necessary mechanical licenses”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, the Stockholm, Sweden-based company agreed to pay more than $43 million to settle a proposed class action alleging it failed to pay royalties for some of the songs it makes available to users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify, which is planning a stock market listing this year, has grown around 20 percent in value to at least $19 billion in the past few months.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A swarm of submarine drones will scour the depths for MH370</title>
<link>https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21733399-swarm-submarine-drones-will-scour-depths-plane-fantastical-ship</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21733399-swarm-submarine-drones-will-scour-depths-plane-fantastical-ship</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;ON JANUARY 2nd, at 8pm local time, a strange vessel weighed anchor and sailed out of the Port of Durban, in South Africa, heading east. Her hull was orange. Her superstructure bristled with antennas—some long and pointy, some sleek, white and domed. Her stern sported a crane and also a strange gantry, known to her crew as the “stinger”. Her bow looked so huge and ungainly as to be on the point of tipping her, nose first, into the depths. And below deck, invisible to the casual observer, she carried eight autonomous submarines called HUGINs, each six metres long, weighing 1,800kg, and containing a titanium sphere to protect the sensitive electronics therein from the pressure of the ocean’s depths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strange ship’s name is &lt;em&gt;Seabed Constructor&lt;/em&gt;. She is a Norwegian research vessel, built in 2014 and owned by Swire Seabed, a dredging and surveying firm in Bergen. At the moment, though, she is leased to Ocean Infinity, a company based in Houston, Texas. And the task Ocean Infinity has hired her for is a hard one: to find whatever is left of flight MH370, a Boeing 777-200ER that left Kuala Lumpur on March 8th 2014 with 239 people on board and vanished over the Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disappearance of MH370 is one of the great mysteries of modern civil aviation. The aircraft was bound for Beijing, but changed course suddenly over the South China Sea and broke off radio contact. It was last detected by radar near the northern tip of Sumatra, heading west-north-west into the open ocean. Subsequent connections to a communications satellite suggested that it crashed somewhere along an arc 1,500km west of Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search that followed was the largest in aviation history. It was mounted by Fugro, a Dutch firm, and paid for by the Malaysian, Chinese and Australian governments. Over the course of three years Fugro managed to scan 120,000 square kilometres of seabed. But it found nothing. The plan is for Ocean Infinity’s search to be paid for, on a “no find, no fee” basis, by Malaysia alone. Contracts have yet to be signed, but Oliver Plunkett, Ocean Infinity’s boss, has decided to go ahead anyway, to take advantage of the window of good weather that opens in the southern Indian Ocean in January and February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocean Infinity aims to cover the ground much faster than Fugro did. In prior cruises in the Atlantic, the firm has, according to Josh Broussard, its technical director, managed to scan 890 square kilometres a day using six autonomous submarines. With eight, Mr Broussard thinks that the new mission will be able to manage 1,200 a day—enough to have covered the original search area in just 100 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new search area, 25,000 square kilometres of sea floor chosen by investigators from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), is just north of the old one (see map). Fugro could infer MH370’s crash site only from its final, rather shaky, communication signals. Ocean Infinity’s effort has been guided as well by wreckage washed ashore on the coasts of Madagascar, Mozambique and Réunion—hence the more northerly starting point. &lt;em&gt;Seabed Constructor&lt;/em&gt; will reach the starting-point of the search, about 35°S off the coast of Western Australia, on or about January 17th, her crew having conducted a few final tests and calibrations of the HUGIN system en route, using remote-controlled robots to place dummy debris on the sea floor in order to see if the subs can find it. If searching the patch of ocean designated by the ATSB reveals nothing, then the ship will head further north, towards the 30th parallel, which some independent experts believe is a better bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rolling in the deep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fugro’s search used but a single autonomous submarine, and this was unable to dive below 4,000 metres, meaning it was not always close to the seabed. The HUGINs carried by &lt;em&gt;Seabed Constructor&lt;/em&gt; can, however, go as deep as 6,000 metres. That permits them to reach most of the sea floor comfortably. And the fact that there are eight of them means different areas can be searched in parallel, and that some submarines will always be at sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HUGINs will be launched by the stinger, which extends out over the ship’s stern. Once underwater, the robot craft will communicate with the ship using an acoustic modem. The ship’s own modem, which will receive these signals, is fixed to the end of a long pole that extends down through her hull into the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each HUGIN comes with a 300kg lithium-polymer battery pack, good for a tour of duty lasting up to 60 hours. A downward-pointing sonar will map the contours of the seabed beneath the craft, but most of the searching will be done by side-mounted sonars scanning the bed on either side of the craft. These send out pings and measure the intensity with which they are reflected. Sand reflects less sound than metal does, meaning metal objects such as aircraft debris are easy to distinguish. And if something apparently metallic is detected, its nature can be confirmed using an on-board magnetometer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HUGINs’ search patterns are set by people, but the craft will actually navigate with little reference to their mother ship. Every so often, the ship will send out a corrective ping to keep them on course. Mostly, however, they will employing dead reckoning, based on data from accelerometers, to steer themselves autonomously. They are also capable of picking their way without assistance over sheer underwater cliffs and mountains, past crevices and gullies, using on-board cameras and machine-vision software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After its tour of duty, a HUGIN will be lifted back on-board ship and the data it has collected (up to two terabytes, recorded on a waterproof hard drive) downloaded into the ship’s data centre and turned into human-readable maps, a process that takes six hours. The HUGIN’s battery will be replaced with a fully charged one, any necessary repairs made, and the craft then sent back out into the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team of geologists and hydrographers will then pore over the maps, looking for signs of the missing plane. Surprisingly, for such a high-tech operation, this stage of the search will be entirely manual. Every block of sea floor that the HUGINs map will be examined by three sets of human eyes. Together, this survey team will come up with a list of possible targets, ranked from “E” to “A” (“nothing” to “that’s it”), to present to their bosses. If the data look good, a HUGIN will be sent down for a second, closer look, cameras at the ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens next, if Ocean Infinity does locate what is left of the missing aircraft, is unclear. Friends and relatives of those aboard it will doubtless find relief from knowing where the flight ended up. But merely finding the wreckage will not explain what happened on board the plane. That will require the discovery of the aircraft’s flight recorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That object is therefore Ocean Infinity’s ultimate target. If the firm finds it on this mission, Mr Broussard says they plan to bring it to the surface and then deliver it for analysis to the Australian authorities, who have the technical competence to assess it. A follow-up trip to examine the wreckage, and even bring it to the surface, would require further authorisation from the Malaysian government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seabed Constructor&lt;/em&gt; is the most advanced civilian survey vessel on the planet today. If its array of technology cannot find MH370, then it is likely that nothing will, and that the mystery of MH370 may never be solved. Either way, though, the advance of technology may mean that it is the last such mystery. As the oceans are watched with ever closer scrutiny, from space and the depths, it is increasingly difficult for anything to get lost in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>After Equifax breach, anger but no action in Congress</title>
<link>https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/01/equifax-data-breach-congress-action-319631</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/01/equifax-data-breach-congress-action-319631</guid>
<description>&lt;aside class=&quot;story-related cl-l db no-border&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The massive Equifax data breach, which compromised the identities of more than 145 million Americans, prompted a telling response from Congress: It did nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some industry leaders and lawmakers thought September’s revelation of the massive intrusion — which took place months after the credit reporting agency failed to act on a warning from the Homeland Security Department — might be the long-envisioned incident that prompted Congress to finally fix the country’s confusing and ineffectual data security laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-continued&quot;&gt;Story Continued Below&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the aftermath of the breach played out like a familiar script: white-hot, bipartisan outrage, followed by hearings and a flurry of proposals that went nowhere. As is often the case, Congress gradually shifted to other priorities — this time the most sweeping tax code overhaul in a generation, and another mad scramble to fund the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s very frustrating,” said Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce consumer protection subcommittee, who introduced legislation in the wake of the Equifax incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every time another shoe falls, I think, ‘Ah, this is it. This will get us galvanized and pull together and march in the same direction.’ Hasn’t happened yet,” said Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), a member of a broader Senate working group that has tinkered for years to come up with data breach legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every time lawmakers punt on the issue, critics say, they are leaving Americans more exposed to ruinous identity theft scams — and allowing companies to evade responsibility. With no sign that mammoth data breaches like the one at Equifax are abating, the situation is only growing more dire, according to cyberspecialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, companies and consumers are left to navigate 48 different state-level standards that govern how companies must protect sensitive data and respond to data breaches. Companies say the varying rules are costly and time-consuming, while cyberspecialists and privacy hawks argue they do little to keep Americans’ data safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while industry groups, security experts, privacy advocates and lawmakers of both parties agree that Congress must do something to unify these laws, no one has been able to agree on what that “something” should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Capitol Hill, lawmakers have struggled to navigate an issue that touches several committees, while tussling over how strongly a federal law should preempt state regulations — Democrats worry a weak federal standard might supplant robust state laws, but Republicans don’t want to give too much power to federal regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the private sector, industries like banking — which already have strict, sector-specific data security rules on the books — have pushed to apply their regulations to broad swaths of the economy. But other industries, such as retailers, believe such a move would impose unnecessary standards on smaller businesses that don’t collect as much sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers told POLITICO that similar forces were at play post-Equifax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carper’s working group is effectively “on hold” for now, he told POLITICO, falling victim to jurisdictional issues. The group features Republican leaders like Senate Commerce Chairman John Thune of South Dakota and Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa, as well as senior Democrats like Intelligence ranking member Mark Warner of Virginia and Dianne Feinstein of California, ranking member on the the Judiciary panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And long-running industry battles came roaring back, Warner said. While lawmakers mostly got the retail and banking industries on board, telecommunications firms — which are already subject to industry-specific privacy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/47/part-64/subpart-U&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt; — became a sticking point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;story-related&quot;&gt;&lt;article class=&quot;story-frag format-sm&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;fig-graphic&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/29/2018-election-hacking-threat-government-help-231512&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot; data-tracking=&quot;mpos=inside-body&amp;amp;mid=parentheticalmodule&amp;amp;lindex=Unknown&amp;amp;lcol=Unknown&quot; class=&quot;js-tealium-tracking&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-lazy-img=&quot;https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/ad5943a/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/90x49%3E/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F22%2Fbe%2F593bfc844bac91db0a895aa4fb46%2Fchristopher-krebs2-gty.jpg&quot; width=&quot;90&quot; height=&quot;49&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; alt=&quot;Christopher Krebs is pictured. | Getty Images&quot; data-size=&quot;promo_xsmall_rectangle&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think one of the problems was telecom,” said Warner, himself a former telecom executive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All industries have to be covered” by federal data breach laws, Warner added. “But then, how they’re covered could be tailored. … What you can’t do is start coming along and carving out. I think that still remains to be an issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of legislative response has industry groups and lawmakers, including Thune, uttering a familiar refrain: Wait until next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Thune said that as much as he favors “an effective and coordinated approach on data security issues across industries, the reality is that our legislative progress has been much more incremental this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There hasn’t been — and still isn’t — consensus among major stakeholders on data breach and data security legislation,” he added. “There isn’t a panacea for cybersecurity and the absolute worst thing we could do is pass an ineffective mandate that leads Americans to take our guard down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those working on the issue also expressed cautious optimism about 2018, despite the fact that Congress has been bullish about “next year” for the last half-decade, to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think there is a political dynamic and clearly a policy interest in doing something to stop these breaches, by deterring them and helping people who are harmed by them,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who is backing legislation that would let prosecutors potentially seek jail time for companies that cover up data breaches. Ride-hailing giant Uber was recently caught mounting such a cover-up, when it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/21/uber-coverup-data-breach-186597&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;disclosed&lt;/a&gt; it had paid $100,000 to keep hackers silent about a 2016 digital theft that compromised 57 million customers’ information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Certainly, every member here has had constituents that have been victims of these breaches, be it Target or Equifax or whoever, and you would think that they would be interested in moving ahead,” added Schakowsky, whose bill would set federal digital security benchmarks and require prompt notification and ongoing assistance to breach victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;House Energy and Commerce Chairman Greg Walden told POLITICO he was working on “a more consumer-first policy” that he plans to unveil after additional hearings in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure would create penalties in a way that “actually inures to the benefit of the consumer,” instead of “just another penalty to the government [where] the government gets paid,” said the Oregon Republican.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry representatives who track the negotiations said some progress is occurring on Capitol Hill, despite the lack of concrete steps in the past four months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers are trying to produce a bill that can actually move, said Jason Kratovil, vice president of government affairs for payments at the Financial Services Roundtable, which has backed proposals from a House Financial Services subpanel in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;story-related&quot;&gt;&lt;article class=&quot;story-frag format-sm&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;fig-graphic&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/29/nerdcast-defining-moments-of-2017-319616&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot; data-tracking=&quot;mpos=inside-body&amp;amp;mid=parentheticalmodule&amp;amp;lindex=Unknown&amp;amp;lcol=Unknown&quot; class=&quot;js-tealium-tracking&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-lazy-img=&quot;https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/d8ca621/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/90x49%3E/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fb1%2F25%2Fd028461d4446bcb4a092cf557fa8%2Fnerdcast-1229-ap.jpg&quot; width=&quot;90&quot; height=&quot;49&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; alt=&quot;nerdcast 1229_ap.jpg&quot; data-size=&quot;promo_xsmall_rectangle&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think there’s a lot of energy being spent trying to get this one right and work toward a legislative outcome that isn’t just a product of one committee and one committee’s jurisdiction, but instead is something that is going to have a lot of interest and a lot of support from many different stakeholders,” he told POLITICO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A retail industry representative told POLITICO that 2018 might be different because industries are increasingly not using data security as a proxy battle for other policy fights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this case, we think we can find some common ground,” said the individual, who requested anonymity to discuss behind-the-scenes negotiations. “I don’t think that was there before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overriding factor pressuring lawmakers and industry groups to take action will be the gobsmacking way companies have mishandled their data breaches — a trend that shows no signs of ending in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if the Equifax breach — which featured basic security failures, allegations of insider trading and possible attempts to prevent consumers from suing the company — didn’t do the trick, some aren’t sure what will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you’ve got 145 million people, you would think, but …” Schakowsky said, trailing off and throwing up her hands.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Using Java 9 Modularization to Ship Zero-Dependency Apps</title>
<link>https://steveperkins.com/using-java-9-modularization-to-ship-zero-dependency-native-apps/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://steveperkins.com/using-java-9-modularization-to-ship-zero-dependency-native-apps/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;When Java was first introduced, mainstream programming languages mostly either compiled to standalone executables (e.g. C/C++, COBOL), or else ran in an interpreter (e.g. Perl, Tcl). For many programmers, Java’s need for both a bytecode compiler &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; a runtime interpreter was a shift in thought. The compilation model made Java better suited for business programming than “scripting” languages. Yet the runtime model required a suitable JVM to be deployed and available on each target machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People bristled at this somewhat (at least &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; remember doing so!). Early web forums, and later StackOverflow questions, were full of developers looking for some way to ship their Java applications as “native” executables. To &lt;mark&gt;avoid the need for a Java runtime to be installed on the target machine&lt;/mark&gt; prior to deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been solutions from nearly the beginning. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.excelsiorjet.com/&quot;&gt;Excelsior JET&lt;/a&gt; is an ahead-of-time (AOT) Java compiler, providing a more-or-less C++ style experience. However, with licensing costs in the thousands of dollars, it has always been a niche option. On the free-as-in-beer end, there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;Launch4j&lt;/a&gt;, and JDK 8’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/deploy/packager.html&quot;&gt;javapackager&lt;/a&gt; tool. These allow you to bundle a Java Runtime Environment, with a launcher executable for starting your app with that JRE. However, &lt;mark&gt;embedding a JRE adds roughly 200 megabytes&lt;/mark&gt;. It’s difficult to trim that down, due to technical reasons as well as tricky licensing issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most publicized new feature in Java 9 is the new modularization system, known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/&quot;&gt;Project Jigsaw&lt;/a&gt;. The full scope of this warrants many blog articles, if not complete books. However, in a nutshell, the new module system is about isolating chunks of code and their dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This applies not only for external libraries, but even the Java standard library itself. Meaning that your application can declare which &lt;em&gt;parts&lt;/em&gt; of the standard library it really needs, and potentially &lt;em&gt;exclude all the other parts&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This potential is realized through the &lt;code&gt;jlink&lt;/code&gt; tool that &lt;a href=&quot;http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/282&quot;&gt;now ships with the JDK&lt;/a&gt;. At a superficial first glance, &lt;code&gt;jlink&lt;/code&gt; is similar to &lt;code&gt;javapackager&lt;/code&gt;. It generates a bundle, consisting of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;your application code and dependencies,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an embedded Java Runtime Environment, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a native launcher (i.e. bash script or Windows batch file) for launching your application with the embedded JRE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;code&gt;jlink&lt;/code&gt; establishes “link time” as a new optional phase, in between compile-time and run-time, for performing optimizations such as removing unreachable code. Meaning that unlike &lt;code&gt;javapackager&lt;/code&gt;, which bundles the entire standard library, &lt;code&gt;jlink&lt;/code&gt; &lt;mark&gt;bundles a stripped-down JRE with only those modules that your application needs&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between &lt;code&gt;jlink&lt;/code&gt; and it’s older alternatives is striking. To illustrate, let’s look at a sample project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/steve-perkins/jlink-demo&quot;&gt;https://github.com/steve-perkins/jlink-demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-create-a-modularized-project&quot;&gt;(1) Create a modularized project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This repo contains a multi-project Gradle build. The &lt;code&gt;cli&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory is a “Hello World” command-line application, while &lt;code&gt;gui&lt;/code&gt; is a JavaFX desktop app. For both, notice that the &lt;code&gt;build.gradle&lt;/code&gt; file configures each project for Java 9 compatibility with this line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-groovy&quot;&gt;sourceCompatibility = 1.9
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, along with creating a &lt;code&gt;module-info.java&lt;/code&gt; file, sets up each project for modularization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;/cli/src/main/java/module-info.java&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;module cli {
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;/gui/src/main/java/module-info.java&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;module gui {
    requires javafx.graphics;
    requires javafx.controls;

    exports gui;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our CLI application is just a glorified &lt;code&gt;System.out.println()&lt;/code&gt; call, so it depends only on the &lt;code&gt;java.base&lt;/code&gt; module (which is always implicit, and needs no declaration).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all applications use JavaFX, however, so our GUI app must declare its dependency on the &lt;code&gt;javafx.graphics&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;javafx.controls&lt;/code&gt; modules. Moreover, because of the way that JavaFX works, the low-level library needs access to our code. So the module’s &lt;code&gt;exports gui&lt;/code&gt; line grants this visibility to itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s going to take some time for Java developers (myself included!) to get a feel for the new standard library modules and what they contain. The JDK includes a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/tools/jdeps.htm#JSWOR690&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;jdeps&lt;/code&gt; tool&lt;/a&gt; that can help with this. However, &lt;mark&gt;once a project is setup for modularization, IntelliJ is great at recognizing missing declarations and helping auto-complete them&lt;/mark&gt;. I assume that if Eclipse and NetBeans don’t have similar support already, then they soon will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-build-an-executable-jar&quot;&gt;(2) Build an executable JAR&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build a deployable bundle with &lt;code&gt;jlink&lt;/code&gt;, you first want to package up your application into an executable JAR file. If your project has third-party library dependencies, then you’ll want to use your choice of “shaded” or “fat-JAR” plugins to generate a single JAR with all dependencies included. In this case, our examples use only the standard library. So building an executable JAR is a simple matter of telling Gradle’s &lt;code&gt;jar&lt;/code&gt; plugin to include a &lt;code&gt;META-INF/MANIFEST.MF&lt;/code&gt; file declaring the executable class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-groovy&quot;&gt;jar {
    manifest {
        attributes 'Main-Class': 'cli.Main'
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-run-jlink-on-it&quot;&gt;(3) Run jlink on it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, Gradle does not yet have a plugin offering clean and seemless integration with &lt;code&gt;jlink&lt;/code&gt;. So my build scripts use an &lt;code&gt;Exec&lt;/code&gt; task to run the tool in a completely separate process. It should be easy to follow, such that you can tell the command-line invocation would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;[JAVA_HOME]/bin/jlink --module-path libs:[JAVA_HOME]/jmods --add-modules cli --launcher cli=cli/cli.Main --output dist --strip-debug --compress 2 --no-header-files --no-man-pages
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;--module-path&lt;/code&gt; flag is analogous to the traditional CLASSPATH. It declares where the tool should look for compiled module binaries (i.e. JAR files, or the new JMOD format). Here, we tell it to look in the project’s &lt;code&gt;libs&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory (because that’s where Gradle puts our executable JAR), and in the JDK directory for the standard library modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;--add-modules&lt;/code&gt; flag declares which modules to add to the resulting bundle. We only need to declare our own project modules (&lt;code&gt;cli&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;gui&lt;/code&gt;), because the modules that &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; depends on will be pulled in as transitive dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting bundle will include a &lt;code&gt;/bin&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory, with a bash script or Windows batch file for executing your application. The &lt;code&gt;--launcher&lt;/code&gt; flag allows you to specify a name for this script, and which Java class it should invoke (which seems a bit redundant as this is already specified in the an executable JAR). Above, we are saying to create a script named &lt;code&gt;bin/cli&lt;/code&gt;, which will invoke the class &lt;code&gt;cli.Main&lt;/code&gt; in module &lt;code&gt;cli&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;--output&lt;/code&gt; flag, intuitively enough, specifies a subdirectory in which to place the resulting bundle. Here, we are using a target directory named &lt;code&gt;dist&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These final flags, &lt;code&gt;--strip-debug&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;--compress 2&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;--no-header-files&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;--no-man-pages&lt;/code&gt;, are some &lt;mark&gt;optimizations I’ve tinkered with to further reduce the resulting bundle size&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the project root level, this Gradle command builds and links both sub-projects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;./gradlew linkAll
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting deployable bundles can be found at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;[PROJECT_ROOT]/cli/build/dist
[PROJECT_ROOT]/gui/build/dist
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a took at size of our linked CLI and GUI applications, with their stripped-down embedded JRE’s:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;App&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Raw Size&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Compressed with 7-zip&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cli&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;21.7 MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;10.8 MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;gui&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;45.8 MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;29.1 MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is on a Windows machine, with a 64-bit JRE (Linux sizes are a bit larger, but still roughly proportionate). Some notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;4.2230769230769&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, &lt;mark&gt;the full JRE on this platform is 203 megabytes.&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1.9470198675497&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A “Hello World” CLI written in Go compiles to around 2 MB. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gohugo.io/&quot;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, the website generator used to publish this blog, is &lt;mark&gt;a 27.2 megabyte Go executable.&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3.6315789473684&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For cross-platform GUI development, &lt;mark&gt;a typical Qt or GTK application ships with around 15 megs of Windows DLL’s for the GUI functionality alone&lt;/mark&gt;. Plus any other shared libs, for functionality that Java provides in its base standard library. &lt;mark&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start&quot;&gt;Electron quick-start example&lt;/a&gt; produces a 131 MB deliverable&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, an application bundle with a launch script is not &lt;strong&gt;quite&lt;/strong&gt; as clean as “&lt;em&gt;just building an .EXE&lt;/em&gt;”, and having a single monolithic file. Also, the JRE is comparatively sluggish at startup, as its JIT compiler warms up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, &lt;mark&gt;Java is now at a place where you can ship self-contained, zero-dependency applications that are comparable in size to other compiled languages (and superior to web-hybrid options like Electron)&lt;/mark&gt;. Also, Java 9 &lt;a href=&quot;http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/295&quot;&gt;includes an experimental AOT compiler&lt;/a&gt;, that might eliminate sluggish startup. While only available for 64-bit Linux initially, this &lt;code&gt;jaotc&lt;/code&gt; tool will hopefully soon expand to other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Go has been very high-profile in the early wave of cloud infrastructure CLI tools (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.docker.com/&quot;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.consul.io/&quot;&gt;Consul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vaultproject.io/&quot;&gt;Vault&lt;/a&gt;, etc)… Java is becoming a strong alternative, especially for shops with established Java experience. For cross-platform desktop GUI apps, I would argue that JavaFX combined with Java 9 modularization is hands-down the best choice available today.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Using Java 9 Modularization to Ship Zero-Dependency Native Apps</og:title>
<og:description>“Why can’t I just build an .EXE?“ When Java was first introduced, mainstream programming languages mostly either compiled to standalone executables (e.g. C/C++, COBOL), or else ran in an interpreter (e.g. Perl, Tcl). For many programmers, Java’s need for both a bytecode compiler and a runtime interpreter was a shift in thought. The compilation model made Java better suited for business programming than “scripting” languages. Yet the runtime model required a suitable JVM to be deployed and available on each target machine.</og:description>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://mapzen.com/blog/shutdown/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we have some sad news. Mapzen will cease operations at the end of January 2018. Our hosted APIs and all related support and services will turn off on February 1, 2018. You will not be charged for API usage in December/January. We know this is an inconvenience and have provided a &lt;a href=&quot;https://mapzen.com/blog/migration&quot;&gt;migration guide to similar services&lt;/a&gt; for our developer community. Our goal is to help as much as possible to ensure continuity in the services that you have built with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the core products of Mapzen are built entirely on open software and data. As a result, there are options to run Mapzen services yourself or to switch to other service providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for being with us over the past four years. We’re grateful that the open work we’ve done can continue outside of Mapzen and while we know this is a sad day, we’re optimistic about what’s next.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How Atlassian Built a $10B Growth Engine</title>
<link>https://producthabits.com/atlassian-built-10-billion-growth-engine/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://producthabits.com/atlassian-built-10-billion-growth-engine/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We’ve had a lot of smart people who wouldn’t join the company or give us money or advise us because [our business] made no sense to them.” — &lt;strong&gt;Mike Cannon-Brookes, Atlassian co-founder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Atlassian was founded in 2002, the founders had a choice to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They could jump through the standard hoops and do the things that most SaaS companies were doing—build out a sales team, knock down investors’ doors, and try to turn an idea into millions of dollars in funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, Atlassian didn’t jump through the standard (and expected) hoops. Instead, they chose an unconventional path that would ultimately help them build a $10 billion business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atlassian still doesn’t have an enterprise sales team 15 years into the company’s founding. But their biggest—and most unusual—lever for growth has been to consistently acquire other products throughout the company’s history and integrate them into the existing product suite. This has helped Atlassian grow into a family of products that can spread organically through enterprise organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How exactly has Atlassian created a growth engine around acquisitions and integrations to build their behemoth global business? Let’s dive deeper into how the company:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Developed a loyal market by building a best-in-class project management tool for engineering teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategically expanded their product offerings through acquisitions to broaden their customer base to teams &lt;em&gt;around&lt;/em&gt; the dev teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doubled down on freemium distribution and horizontal use-cases in their recent acquisitions to make the top of their funnel even wider across teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So many of Atlassian’s strategies were unique for their time, but have since become common practice for SaaS companies. Let’s take a look at how several of these practices were developed out of Atlassian’s specific needs throughout the company’s lifetime, and how each one helped shape the company’s success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2002-2010: Self-funded and freemium&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2002—the tail end of a nuclear winter for tech—being a Silicon Valley entrepreneur was tough. But being an entrepreneur in Sydney, Australia was much harder. There wasn’t a large tech community, and there weren’t local VCs that founders could go to for investments. Atlassian co-founders Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar put it this way: there was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2015/12/10/atlassian-ceo-talks-going-public-as-silicon-valley-outsider/#3bb499679695&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2015/12/10/atlassian-ceo-talks-going-public-as-silicon-valley-outsider/#3bb499679695', 'no IPO preschool');&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;no IPO preschool&lt;/a&gt; like there was in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with an idea for a new developer tool and no money, they realized that building a successful company meant two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They had to create really useful tools quickly so they could win over the market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They had to find a way to sell them without paying for a sales team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since they were developers themselves, the co-founders saw the need for developer-specific tools around tracking issues and collaborating with one another. They built these functions into their first two tools—Jira and Confluence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one had built project management or collaboration tools yet for developers, and the co-founders knew from their own work that other developers would want these tools. All they had to do was get them to try it. They decided to use a freemium plan to allow people to test out the tools without risk, and realize for themselves how useful they were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model allowed a lot of people to start using the tools really quickly—and as they onboarded more customers and grew revenue without sales overhead, they were able to start acquiring other companies and adding to their developer offerings very early on in their company’s lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a closer look at how they built—and acquired—these initial products in the early years to win over the developer market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2002:&lt;/strong&gt; Cannon-Brookes and Farquhar both studied computer science and met in college. They knew they wanted to start their own company, and they began by creating a third-party support service. On the side, they built their own issue tracker because they were fed up with using email or personal productivity tools to track their developer work. Doing developer work is messy and they needed a concrete place where they could log issues and work collaboratively. Soon, they realized what they built had the potential to be really useful for other developers—and they decided to pivot from a service company to a product company. They took out $10,000 in credit card debt to start Atlassian, and launched that first flagship product, Jira.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jira featured a simple interface and provided developers with a single place to manage bugs, plan features, and track tasks. Jira also featured version-history, file attachments, and a search function for issues—everything a developer needed to manage software projects in one place. This hadn’t been possible before with other tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of Jira’s comprehensiveness and complexity, the product came with a steep learning curve. But this was actually a blessing in Atlassian’s specific market. The thing that made the product challenging to learn was what developers loved most about it—that it did &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; needed for issue tracking, and they could customize it to work precisely the way they needed it to for their specific teams and projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2004:&lt;/strong&gt; Jira was bringing in revenue, but even in these first years, Atlassian was on the lookout for other potential revenue streams. Wiki technology was gaining traction in the developer market—the Atlassian co-founders took this as their opportunity to provide simple wiki functions to teams with the requirements of enterprise knowledge management systems. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theserverside.com/discussions/thread/24701.html&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.theserverside.com/discussions/thread/24701.html', 'They called this new dev team collaboration platform Confluence');&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;They called this new dev team collaboration platform Confluence&lt;/a&gt;. It was for the kinds of teams that would also use Jira, and was meant to provide more value by making wikis easy to create, edit, link, search, and organize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-811&quot; src=&quot;https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/confluence-graphic.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1174&quot; height=&quot;430&quot; srcset=&quot;https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/confluence-graphic.jpg 1174w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/confluence-graphic-300x110.jpg 300w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/confluence-graphic-768x281.jpg 768w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/confluence-graphic-1024x375.jpg 1024w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/confluence-graphic-450x165.jpg 450w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1174px) 100vw, 1174px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confluence also integrated really well with Jira, which developer teams were already starting to love. It worked seamlessly with another really specific, useful product, which motivated teams to give Confluence a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to build a second product after the initial success of Jira was risky because many early-stage companies focus all of their attention on a single product. Dividing resources could have meant that both products would fail. But the team had faith in how much users liked using Jira, and recognized that there were still other helpful tools Atlassian could provide. The multi-product strategy paid off. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2016/9/8/12854474/atlassian-mike-cannon-brookes-australia-recode-decode-podcast-transcript&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.recode.net/2016/9/8/12854474/atlassian-mike-cannon-brookes-australia-recode-decode-podcast-transcript', 'As Cannon-Brookes said');&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;As Cannon-Brookes said&lt;/a&gt;: “We had two rocket engines driving us along, not just one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2005:&lt;/strong&gt; Just three years after its founding, Atlassian was profitable without having taken any venture capital. This was because they charged enterprise prices and didn’t have to spend money paying sales people: they sold the product by providing an option for a 30-day free trial on their website, and then gave trial users the option to get on a paid plan. This allowed developers to try their products out, realize how useful they were, and then recommend the products to their team members and developer friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2007:&lt;/strong&gt; At this time, both Jira and Confluence sales were growing, and this validated that the developer market was a space with a lot of opportunity. But here’s where Atlassian made a really interesting, unique move. The typical way for enterprise developer tool companies to expand is to build more products. Since Atlassian had capital, they decided that instead of spending time building more of their own tools, they’d buy ones that were already successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lead them to look to the company Cenqua, which made three developer tools—Fisheye, Crucible, and Clover. These tools filled the gaps in Atlassian’s product offerings. Cannon-Brookes noted that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infoq.com/news/2007/08/atlassiancenqua&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.infoq.com/news/2007/08/atlassiancenqua', 'some of the functionality of these tools');&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;some of the functionality of these tools&lt;/a&gt;, like Crucible’s code review, was incredibly valuable to developers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://radiowalker.wordpress.com/2007/08/02/why-atlassian-acquired-cenqua/&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://radiowalker.wordpress.com/2007/08/02/why-atlassian-acquired-cenqua/', 'He said');&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;He said&lt;/a&gt; that “on a scale of one to ten, the strategic fit [of the Cenqua tools] is a ten.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They integrated these products into their offerings by allowing the services to continue uninterrupted, but moved all of the products’ information and documentation over to the Atlassian site. All of Cenqua’s development and executive staff moved over to join Atlassian. By 2008, The Crucible tools were listed alongside Atlassian’s other product offerings on Atlassian’s website as part of a cohesive product suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-812&quot; src=&quot;https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/altassian-suite.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2560&quot; height=&quot;1804&quot; srcset=&quot;https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/altassian-suite.jpg 2560w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/altassian-suite-300x211.jpg 300w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/altassian-suite-768x541.jpg 768w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/altassian-suite-1024x722.jpg 1024w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/altassian-suite-1200x846.jpg 1200w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/altassian-suite-450x317.jpg 450w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making such an early acquisition was unusual, especially given the company’s lack of venture funding. But Atlassian’s freemium sales model had helped them quickly generate a lot of revenue. When they weighed the pros and cons of the time and money it would take to build out their own version of those tools, the company saw the acquisition of Cenqua as the best use of their resources at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The freemium sales and distribution model, as well as the early acquisitions, created many revenue streams that lead to over $50M in ARR by 2010. At this point the company was eight years old and had already been profitable for five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was clear that Atlassian didn’t need venture money to survive—they’d built an engine that could survive on its own. But in their long-term plans for the company, they had their own unique reasons for wanting to work with investors in the next stage of growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2010-2015: Integrating acquisitions and spreading to other teams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We want to build a 50-year company. Going public is one step on that journey. There are very few long-term companies that are private.” &lt;strong&gt;– Scott Farquhar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike a lot of companies, Atlassian didn’t raise money because they needed cash—they’d already built a model for a healthy business by winning over the developer market with useful tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early success of Jira, Confluence, and the Cenqua products encouraged the team and proved their freemium distribution model could work. They realized that by building a suite of products developers needed, they could become indispensable to customers and retain them long-term. Given the success of the first acquisition, the company decided the best path forward was to become exceptional at acquisition and folding useful pre-existing products into the Atlassian suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what Atlassian did during this time to acquire the right products, integrate them well, and continue expanding their user base to users that were tangential to dev teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2010:&lt;/strong&gt; Atlassian raised $60 million in secondary funding from Accel Partners, eight years after starting their company. They planned to use the money from the investment to add to their war chest for acquisitions and growth. The team stated that capital would go &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/29/atlassian-buys-mercurial-project-hosting-site-bitbucket/&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/29/atlassian-buys-mercurial-project-hosting-site-bitbucket/', 'toward M&amp;amp;A with other enterprise tools');&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;toward M&amp;amp;A with other enterprise tools&lt;/a&gt;. These additional tools would help them provide even more functionality to enterprise developer teams, and start to widen into other verticals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, Atlassian had &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/29/atlassian-buys-mercurial-project-hosting-site-bitbucket/&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/29/atlassian-buys-mercurial-project-hosting-site-bitbucket/', 'over 20,000 customers');&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;over 20,000 customers&lt;/a&gt; worldwide, including Facebook and Adobe, and were feeling the need to offer an even more robust and comprehensive set of developer tools. So in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/29/atlassian-buys-mercurial-project-hosting-site-bitbucket/&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/29/atlassian-buys-mercurial-project-hosting-site-bitbucket/', 'effort to start doing');&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;effort to start doing&lt;/a&gt; “what Adobe does for designers, except for technical teams,” Atlassian looked at how they could help developers manage their projects at other stages in their pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lead them to acquire Bitbucket, a hosted service for code collaboration, for an undisclosed amount. Bitbucket helped developers share and collaborate on a decentralized software repository. &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/29/atlassian-buys-mercurial-project-hosting-site-bitbucket/&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/29/atlassian-buys-mercurial-project-hosting-site-bitbucket/', 'As one report noted');&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;As one report noted&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to the Bitbucket acquisition, developers now had “a place to dump and host their code, and a place to track their project issues and bugs within Atlassian.” It was a perfect product fit to fill a gap in Atlassian’s offerings. Atlassian offered the product right alongside all of the others, and created new pricing tiers—including a freemium plan—to fit seamlessly into Atlassian’s existing freemium distribution model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2012:&lt;/strong&gt; Atlassian acquired the hosted private chat service Hipchat, and announced a plan to integrate the chat feature into its suite of products. This was a brilliant move that showed Atlassian was ahead of its time—Slack had not blown up yet and a real-time communication tool wasn’t an obvious acquisition. However, Atlassian used Hipchat on their own team and knew how useful it was, so they wanted to provide the same integrated functionality to their users, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HipChat was growing quickly at the time and had over 1,200 customers of their own, including Groupon and HubSpot. The product was helping entire organizations communicate. Pete Curley, the CEO and founder of Hipchat, said that Atlassian was the perfect environment to continue scaling Hipchat’s services quickly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/blog/archives/press-release-atlassian-acquires-hipcha&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.atlassian.com/blog/archives/press-release-atlassian-acquires-hipcha', 'noting');&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;noting&lt;/a&gt; “the no-friction business model.” Acquiring Hipchat was the perfect way for Atlassian to plug another a hole in their product offerings &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; get more non-developer teams to start using Atlassian products. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/blog/archives/press-release-atlassian-acquires-hipcha&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.atlassian.com/blog/archives/press-release-atlassian-acquires-hipcha', 'As Cannon-Brookes put it');&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;As Cannon-Brookes put it&lt;/a&gt;, Hipchat is “perfect for product teams but fantastic for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; team.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2013:&lt;/strong&gt; Atlassian released a service desk offering on top of Jira that targeted the IT market. The new features &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/blog/archives/introducing-jira-service-desk&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.atlassian.com/blog/archives/introducing-jira-service-desk', 'included');&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;included&lt;/a&gt; a customer-centered interface, an SLA engine, customizable team queues, and real-time reports and analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-814&quot; src=&quot;https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/workflows-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1180&quot; height=&quot;554&quot; srcset=&quot;https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/workflows-1.png 1180w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/workflows-1-300x141.png 300w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/workflows-1-768x361.png 768w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/workflows-1-1024x481.png 1024w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/workflows-1-450x211.png 450w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1180px) 100vw, 1180px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, Atlassian president Jay Simmons said that this addition was an organic extension based on the needs of Jira customers. About 40% of Jira users had &lt;a href=&quot;https://gigaom.com/2013/10/02/atlassian-parlays-jira-into-service-desk-world/&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://gigaom.com/2013/10/02/atlassian-parlays-jira-into-service-desk-world/', ' already extended Jira to service desk and help desk use cases');&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;already extended Jira to service desk and help desk use cases&lt;/a&gt; and had asked Atlassian to build the service. The service desk helped extend Atlassian’s offerings to IT departments and continue growing bookings, which at this time were &lt;a href=&quot;https://gigaom.com/2013/10/02/atlassian-parlays-jira-into-service-desk-world/&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://gigaom.com/2013/10/02/atlassian-parlays-jira-into-service-desk-world/', 'over $100 million a year');&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;over $100 million a year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015:&lt;/strong&gt; Atlassian’s Git services were fast growing—Eric Wittman, the general manager of Atlassian’s developer tools, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/22/atlassian-updates-its-git-services-combines-them-under-the-bitbucket-brand/&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/22/atlassian-updates-its-git-services-combines-them-under-the-bitbucket-brand/', 'noted');&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; that Bitbucket’s customer growth the year before was around 80%, and that 1 in 3 Fortune 500 companies used Bitbucket. To align themselves with this kind of growth and present a cohesive brand, Atlassian combined all of their Git-based services under the Bitbucket brand, and added features that supported larger distributed teams and projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-815&quot; src=&quot;https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2017-12-06-at-4.21.35-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1322&quot; height=&quot;822&quot; srcset=&quot;https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2017-12-06-at-4.21.35-PM.png 1322w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2017-12-06-at-4.21.35-PM-300x187.png 300w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2017-12-06-at-4.21.35-PM-768x478.png 768w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2017-12-06-at-4.21.35-PM-1024x637.png 1024w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2017-12-06-at-4.21.35-PM-1200x746.png 1200w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2017-12-06-at-4.21.35-PM-450x280.png 450w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1322px) 100vw, 1322px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over these years, Atlassian filled a gap in team SaaS tools by providing a broad vision for how teams could collaborate. While a lot of companies make acquisitions, most don’t execute well on integration. Combining two separate companies can be a nightmare, with clashing brands, personalities, and even code bases. Atlassian not only developed the skill of making smart acquisitions—they’ve also mastered the treacherous integration process from people to code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This strategy was all about lock-in. With such tightly integrated solutions, the product superiority of one tool wasn’t necessarily the selling point. Instead, it was the comprehensive function of the whole suite of products. It didn’t matter if a company preferred Github’s functions to Bitbucket’s—if a team was already hooked into Jira and Confluence, they were going to use Bitbucket because it made their workflow more convenient and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This strategy fed directly into Atlassian’s low-cost distribution model. They charged very little for the initial products and sold a low number of seats. Each product had its own pricing model, so teams could add products a la carte. Most of them started with a free trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-816 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2017-12-22-at-1.45.15-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2236&quot; height=&quot;604&quot; srcset=&quot;https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2017-12-22-at-1.45.15-PM.png 2236w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2017-12-22-at-1.45.15-PM-300x81.png 300w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2017-12-22-at-1.45.15-PM-768x207.png 768w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2017-12-22-at-1.45.15-PM-1024x277.png 1024w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2017-12-22-at-1.45.15-PM-1200x324.png 1200w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2017-12-22-at-1.45.15-PM-450x122.png 450w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 2236px) 100vw, 2236px&quot;/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20150821011848/https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20150821011848/https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira', 'Jira pricing in 2015.');&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Jira pricing in 2015.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty soon their flywheel would kick into effect as more team members were onboarded, more teams and users got pulled in, and teams realized that trying to work &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; the Atlassian tools would be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal was for the sum of the parts to create a sticky, all-consuming whole. And in terms of acquisition efficiency, it worked. Atlassian spent &lt;a href=&quot;http://tomtunguz.com/atlassian-s-1/&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://tomtunguz.com/atlassian-s-1/', 'between 12 and 21% of their yearly revenue on CAC');&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;between 12 and 21% of their yearly revenue on CAC&lt;/a&gt; from 2012-2015, compared to the SaaS industry median of 50-100%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding products helped Atlassian finding new ways to hook users into the Jira suite—like with Bitbucket for developers and Hipchat for non-developer teams. This led to steep user and revenue growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-817 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2017-12-01-at-6.42.18-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1572&quot; height=&quot;852&quot; srcset=&quot;https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2017-12-01-at-6.42.18-PM.png 1572w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2017-12-01-at-6.42.18-PM-300x163.png 300w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2017-12-01-at-6.42.18-PM-768x416.png 768w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2017-12-01-at-6.42.18-PM-1024x555.png 1024w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2017-12-01-at-6.42.18-PM-1200x650.png 1200w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2017-12-01-at-6.42.18-PM-450x244.png 450w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1572px) 100vw, 1572px&quot;/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650372/000155837015001685/c372-20150821x20fg002.jpg&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650372/000155837015001685/c372-20150821x20fg002.jpg', 'Source');&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first few Atlassian products, like Jira and Confluence, brought in revenue at a steady trickle. The acquisitions allowed Atlassian to compound growth with each additional product. Right before Atlassian’s IPO, they announced $320 million in annual sales, which was up 60% from the year before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atlassian nailed their distribution flywheel and acquisition/integration machine. They were primed to widen the top of their funnel and try to win over even more teams in enterprise organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2015-Present: Expanding to competitive and lucrative markets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a lot of SaaS companies, Atlassian looks like the “end goal.” They’ve grown into a giant, public, global company with a complex and integrated suite of products for many different verticals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Atlassian understands that success is a continuum. They’re burning brightly, but unless they can keep up their growth going and maintain a stronghold over their markets, they’ll flare out. The goal is no longer to just build out a best-in-class suite of tools for developer teams. Rather, it’s getting an entire company—and all of the teams within it—using relevant products in the Atlassian suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Atlassian works to offer products to many different teams within an organization, the company still needs to find a way to stay relevant to small teams. Many of their moneymaking products are getting unnecessarily complex for small teams. Instead of wasting time building lightweight versions, they’re using their successful acquisition and integration strategy to add lightweight products to the Atlassian suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a closer look at exactly how their acquisitions and integrations over the past few years have helped them widen their funnel and expand into more lucrative and competitive markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015:&lt;/strong&gt; Atlassian held its IPO in December and started trading shares with a market cap of &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2015/12/10/atlassian-ipo-leap/&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://fortune.com/2015/12/10/atlassian-ipo-leap/', 'nearly $5.8 billion');&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;nearly $5.8 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s plan after their IPO was to continue expanding sales aggressively by investing in research and development. At the time, they invested &lt;a href=&quot;http://tomtunguz.com/atlassian-s-1/&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://tomtunguz.com/atlassian-s-1/', 'over 40% of their revenue into R&amp;amp;D');&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;over 40% of their revenue into R&amp;amp;D&lt;/a&gt; and wanted to keep up their &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2015/12/10/atlassian-ipo-leap/&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://fortune.com/2015/12/10/atlassian-ipo-leap/', '30% YoY growth');&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;30% YoY growth&lt;/a&gt; for the suite of products. This in turn drove more revenue, which they could put back into R&amp;amp;D and acquisitions to continue fueling their flywheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016:&lt;/strong&gt; To build itself out into an even more ubiquitous tool provider and help companies maintain their software, Atlassian &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/14/atlassian-acquires-statuspage/&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/14/atlassian-acquires-statuspage/', 'acquired Statuspage');&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;acquired Statuspage&lt;/a&gt;, which allows businesses to keep users updated about the status of their online services. Atlassian already had a relationship with Statuspage because they were an early user of Hipchat, and because they already hosted their own statuses with Statuspage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atlassian’s president, Jay Simons, said that he thought the product filled a natural need within Atlassian’s offerings, especially alongside Jira’s issue-tracking services. It was a complementary product for users already using Jira and other products within the suite—but it was also a way to attract different users with a more broad use-case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017:&lt;/strong&gt; Recently, Atlassian took a big step to target smaller teams by acquiring the lightweight project management tool Trello. I’ve already &lt;a href=&quot;https://producthabits.com/why-trello-failed-to-build-a-1-billion-business/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;talked about Atlassian’s acquisition of Trello&lt;/a&gt; from the perspective of Trello’s potential—but the acquisition is also a really important recent step in Atlassian’s journey. Trello is a much simpler project management tool than Jira, and the simple Kanban board covers much broader use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atlassian needed a simple product that could fill the small-company gap in their distribution strategy as Jira moved upmarket and got more complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trello is use-case agnostic, and is a good simple alternative to developer-specific Jira. The addition of Trello directly widens the funnel through which Atlassian can pull new, broader bases of users into their suite—and then cross-sell and upsell them to different products as their needs grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the year, Atlassian made another huge product move by pivoting Hipchat’s services into an &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/atlassian-launches-stride-its-slack-competitor/&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/atlassian-launches-stride-its-slack-competitor/', 'Atlassian-branded product called Stride');&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Atlassian-branded product called Stride&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a Slack competitor for team-wide messaging, which means it has some predictable features like text-based messaging and video and audio conferencing. It also has some unique additions like Focus Mode, an “away” setting while you’re at work, and &lt;em&gt;Actions&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Decisions&lt;/em&gt;, which show highlights from conversations that happened when you were away. According to Atlassian, the goal is to make teams more productive in ways that competitive products don’t do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-822 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2017-12-06-at-5.53.41-PM-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1304&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; srcset=&quot;https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2017-12-06-at-5.53.41-PM-1.png 1304w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2017-12-06-at-5.53.41-PM-1-300x166.png 300w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2017-12-06-at-5.53.41-PM-1-768x424.png 768w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2017-12-06-at-5.53.41-PM-1-1024x565.png 1024w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2017-12-06-at-5.53.41-PM-1-1200x663.png 1200w, https://producthabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2017-12-06-at-5.53.41-PM-1-450x248.png 450w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1304px) 100vw, 1304px&quot;/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/atlassian-launches-stride-its-slack-competitor/&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/atlassian-launches-stride-its-slack-competitor/', 'Source');&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atlassian’s recent product decisions, specifically around Trello and Stride, show that they are still finding new ways to target different teams within companies of all sizes. Both Trello and Stride are freemium products—&lt;a href=&quot;https://producthabits.com/why-trello-failed-to-build-a-1-billion-business/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;this was Trello’s Achilles heel&lt;/a&gt;, but the free plans will be key for acquiring smaller teams that can’t afford to pay for enterprise products with enterprise functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of Atlassian’s most recent product acquisitions—Trello, Stride, or Statuspage—have market-specific use cases. They’re all springboards into virtually any team within an organization of any size. And they all have potential for horizontal adoption across teams once there’s buy-in with one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These recent moves show that Atlassian is being very smart about growing product offerings for more wide-spread use cases in more competitive and lucrative markets. They’re turning acquisitions into additional product offerings—but at the same time, they’re clearing out potential disruptors and protecting the lock-in they’ve already established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where Atlassian can go from here&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atlassian’s pattern of acquisition—and their success with product additions—is very atypical. Looking forward, they have all of the pieces in place to continue edging out into even more additional markets through acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With its acquisition/integration machine in place, here are some specific ways Atlassian can expand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Trello to land in new companies:&lt;/strong&gt; The acquisition of Trello is all about finding a way to land in new areas within organizations. One of the biggest opportunities for Atlassian with Trello is to gain support among product managers on teams that aren’t yet using Jira or other Atlassian tools. Because Trello is so simple, there is much less friction, making it easier for teams to adopt the product. But it has a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/trello-power-ups-for-atlassian-suite&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/trello-power-ups-for-atlassian-suite', 'powerful integrations with Atlassian tools');&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;powerful integrations with Atlassian tools&lt;/a&gt; that simplify workflows across teams. This adds another point of entry for teams into the Atlassian suite. If Atlassian can onboard PMs to Trello, they may be able to get those they collaborate with, like dev teams, using Trello as well. Exposure to Trello will make these dev teams aware of integrated products like Jira, and may motivate them to use the more developer-specific tools if they aren’t already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Stride to connect all elements of team collaboration:&lt;/strong&gt; Messenger tools are important layers in any company’s ability to collaborate—and they have the potential to reach every single team in a company. Atlassian knows that it can’t give away this precious and far-reaching potential to Slack, which has integrations that allow users to plug in workplace tools. Stride is a defensive move, but it has potential to be really useful to Atlassian users and pull more users throughout a company into the Atlassian suite. Less back and forth and manual transfer of information would make work much more productive and painless, so Atlassian has to make sure their integrations and marketing around Stride tap into that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build out designer tools:&lt;/strong&gt; Atlassian provides users with &lt;a href=&quot;https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/', 'Atlaskit');&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Atlaskit&lt;/a&gt;, which is the company’s official UI library. It contains all of the tools needed to build in Atlassian’s design style. But Atlassian can expand to build out more agnostic front-end developer tools that can be used for UI design and UX testing. They have the potential to compete with Invision and build a better integrated tool for designers. They could kickstart the effort by purchasing a full stack UX design platform like UXPin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Atlassian team bought themselves a lot of time to make careful decisions by building a healthy business that could stand on its own legs, become profitable, and go public. Moving forward, if they continue to make calculated decisions, they could be the main provider of the most helpful workplace tools for SaaS companies of all sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3 key lessons from Atlassian’s growth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The co-founders know that Atlassian is different than other SaaS companies. A lot of their decisions have been unconventional and really specific to their constraints. They’ve said to other companies, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2016/9/8/12854474/atlassian-mike-cannon-brookes-australia-recode-decode-podcast-transcript&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.recode.net/2016/9/8/12854474/atlassian-mike-cannon-brookes-australia-recode-decode-podcast-transcript', 'don’t try to copy us');&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;don’t try to copy us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bigger point for those growing their own businesses is that you shouldn’t and can’t copy any of Atlassian’s decisions because each company has to find ways to succeed based on their specific goals and challenges. But you can learn from the way that Atlassian approached their problems and how they looked for opportunities. These skills are vital to success and growth—without them, you’re dead in the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the key lessons that anyone building a company should take away from Atlassian:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Focus on capital efficiency early on&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many SaaS companies try to bootstrap their way to profitability. What made Atlassian’s journey so unique—and so successful—is that they pioneered a lot of unprecedented ways of doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, Atlassian used a freemium distribution model starting in 2002 because they couldn’t afford a sales team. There weren’t a lot of enterprise software companies doing this at the time. But this made sales and marketing spend from the outset very low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important step towards capital efficiency was aggressively adding more products very early on. This was risky because many companies gain their footing by focusing on a single product. Atlassian started building out a suite very early, which bolstered revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main mechanics that contribute to better capital efficiency: &lt;strong&gt;lower CAC&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;higher revenue&lt;/strong&gt;. Atlassian found specific ways to lower their CAC and grow their revenue that worked for them, and you can do the same by looking at your unique constraints and considering the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.profitwell.com/the-complete-saas-guide-to-calculating-and-reducing-cac&quot; onclick=&quot;__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://blog.profitwell.com/the-complete-saas-guide-to-calculating-and-reducing-cac', 'lower CAC');&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;lower CAC&lt;/a&gt; by targeting more effective marketing channels, onboarding freemium users more effectively to paid accounts, and focusing on inbound marketing through content and free trials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can grow revenue by increasing your prices, adding additional revenue streams from new products, and cross-selling users to other products and add-ons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital efficiency was vital to Atlassian’s early growth and success, and it’s a good mentality and practice for any SaaS company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Own a particular customer segment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atlassian put down roots in developer teams. From there, it had a point of entry within enterprise organizations to expand to other teams. Having a stronghold over developer teams who loved using Jira and wouldn’t want to switch was essential to onboarding other teams to auxiliary Atlassian tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://producthabits.com/salesforce-built-10-billion-empire-crm/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Salesforce has done the same thing in the sales market&lt;/a&gt;. Even though they’re now expanding out into almost every market in enterprise businesses, they started with just a CRM and got lock-in within sales teams. Winning over one department is key to playing the long game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re just starting out, it’s hard to win over broad use cases because it’s difficult to hone in on one specific value proposition and get anyone’s attention. Instead, &lt;strong&gt;focus on one department&lt;/strong&gt; within an organization and evangelize your product to that specific group of people. There are some specific steps you can take to grow this evangelism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Offer workshops and networking conferences with early groups of users in one specific market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk to early customers within your target market about what specific problems your product solves, and make sure that your marketing reflects these pain points and solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you start building add-ons and new features, make sure they’re specifically related to your target market before expanding out to other segments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Choose the style of business you want to master&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to build a great company. Some choose to focus more on product innovation. Others, like Atlassian, put more emphasis on strategic acquisitions. A company like Salesforce chose to focus on delivery method and industry disruption. Some, like Basecamp, focus on single product simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no one-size-fits-all path, but there is a common theme among all of these successful companies. They all developed a concept to master early on, and they stuck with it and followed through in all of their decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deciding what is more important for your company to master early on is challenging but it gives you sharp focus. Two important factors will shape this early decision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is your initial vision for your company and product?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;What do you want to accomplish with your company in 5, 10, and 20 years?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Buck convention and build your own growth engine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a long-term company is challenging because you’re going to face so many different constraints at different points in your business. The same factors won’t necessarily drive your growth at every stage. But if you know how you want to grow and have a strategy around what steps you’ll take to do it, you can develop a framework for making decisions in many different circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atlassian’s strategy—acquisition, integration, and organic distribution—was particularly special because not many other companies have done it (and done it well). Your’s may look different from other companies, too. The goal is to develop a framework that helps you win with the cards you’re dealt.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: Sapper.js – towards a better web app framework</title>
<link>https://svelte.technology/blog/sapper-towards-the-ideal-web-app-framework</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://svelte.technology/blog/sapper-towards-the-ideal-web-app-framework</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;standfirst&quot; svelte-1097777898=&quot;&quot;&gt;Taking the next-plus-one step&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;byline&quot; svelte-1097777898=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris&quot;&gt;Rich Harris&lt;/a&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2017-12-31&quot;&gt;Sun Dec 31 2017&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;3.3802816901408&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quickstart for the impatient: &lt;a href=&quot;https://sapper.svelte.technology&quot;&gt;the Sapper docs&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper-template&quot;&gt;starter template&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you had to list the characteristics of the perfect Node.js web application framework, you'd probably come up with something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It should do server-side rendering, for fast initial loads and no caveats around SEO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a corollary, your app's codebase should be universal — write once for server &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; client&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The client-side app should &lt;em&gt;hydrate&lt;/em&gt; the server-rendered HTML, attaching event listeners (and so on) to existing elements rather than re-rendering them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigating to subsequent pages should be instantaneous&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offline, and other Progressive Web App characteristics, must be supported out of the box&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only the JavaScript and CSS required for the first page should load initially. That means the framework should do automatic code-splitting at the route level, and support dynamic &lt;code&gt;import(...)&lt;/code&gt; for more granular manual control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No compromise on performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First-rate developer experience, with hot module reloading and all the trimmings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The resulting codebase should be easy to grok and maintain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should be possible to understand and customise every aspect of the system — no webpack configs locked up in the framework, and as little hidden 'plumbing' as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning the entire framework in under an hour should be easy, and not just for experienced developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zeit/next.js&quot;&gt;Next.js&lt;/a&gt; is close to this ideal. If you haven't encountered it yet, I strongly recommend going through the tutorials at &lt;a href=&quot;https://learnnextjs.com&quot;&gt;learnnextjs.com&lt;/a&gt;. Next introduced a brilliant idea: all the pages of your app are files in a &lt;code&gt;your-project/pages&lt;/code&gt; directory, and each of those files is just a React component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything else flows from that breakthrough design decision. Finding the code responsible for a given page is easy, because you can just look at the filesystem rather than playing 'guess the component name'. Project structure bikeshedding is a thing of the past. And the combination of SSR (server-side rendering) and code-splitting — something the React Router team &lt;a href=&quot;https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/code-splitting&quot;&gt;gave up on&lt;/a&gt;, declaring 'Godspeed those who attempt the server-rendered, code-split apps' — is trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's not perfect. As churlish as it might be to list the flaws in something &lt;em&gt;so, so good&lt;/em&gt;, there are some:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Next uses something called 'route masking' to create nice URLs (e.g. &lt;code&gt;/blog/hello-world&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;/post?slug=hello-world&lt;/code&gt;). This undermines the guarantee about directory structure corresponding to app structure, and forces you to maintain configuration that translates between the two forms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All your routes are assumed to be universal 'pages'. But it's very common to need routes that only render on the server, such as a 301 redirect or an &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.technology/api/blog/sapper-towards-the-ideal-web-app-framework&quot;&gt;API endpoint&lt;/a&gt; that serves the data for your pages, and Next doesn't have a great solution for this. You can add logic to your &lt;code&gt;server.js&lt;/code&gt; file to handle these cases, but it feels at odds with the declarative approach taken for pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To use the client-side router, links can't be standard &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags. Instead, you have to use framework-specific &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Link&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; components, which is impossible in the markdown content for a blog post such as this one, for example&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real problem, though, is that all that goodness comes for a price. The simplest possible Next app — a single 'hello world' page that renders some static text — involves 66kb of gzipped JavaScript. Unzipped, it's 204kb, which is a non-trivial amount of code for a mobile device to parse at a time when performance is a critical factor determining whether or not your users will stick around. And that's the &lt;em&gt;baseline&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can do better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-compiler-as-framework-paradigm-shift&quot;&gt;The compiler-as-framework paradigm shift&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.technology/blog/frameworks-without-the-framework&quot;&gt;Svelte introduced a radical idea&lt;/a&gt;: what if your UI framework wasn't a framework at all, but a compiler that turned your components into standalone JavaScript modules? Instead of using a library like React or Vue, which knows nothing about your app and must therefore be a one-size-fits-all solution, we can ship highly-optimised vanilla JavaScript. Just the code your app needs, and without the memory and performance overhead of solutions based on a virtual DOM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JavaScript world is &lt;a href=&quot;https://tomdale.net/2017/09/compilers-are-the-new-frameworks/&quot;&gt;moving towards this model&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://stenciljs.com&quot;&gt;Stencil&lt;/a&gt;, a Svelte-inspired framework from the Ionic team, compiles to web components. &lt;a href=&quot;https://glimmerjs.com&quot;&gt;Glimmer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; compile to standalone JavaScript (the pros and cons of which deserve a separate blog post), but the team is doing some fascinating research around compiling templates to bytecode. (React is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/trueadm/status/944908776896978946&quot;&gt;getting in on the action&lt;/a&gt;, though their current research focuses on optimising your JSX app code, which is arguably more similar to the ahead-of-time optimisations that Angular, Ractive and Vue have been doing for a few years.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if we use the new model as a starting point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;introducing-sapper&quot;&gt;Introducing Sapper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://sapper.svelte.technology/guide#why-the-name-&quot;&gt;name comes from&lt;/a&gt; the term for combat engineers, and is also short for &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;velte &lt;strong&gt;app&lt;/strong&gt; mak&lt;strong&gt;er&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sapper.svelte.technology&quot;&gt;Sapper&lt;/a&gt; is the answer to that question. &lt;strong&gt;Sapper is a Next.js-style framework that aims to meet the eleven criteria at the top of this article while dramatically reducing the amount of code that gets sent to the browser.&lt;/strong&gt; It's implemented as Express-compatible middleware, meaning it's easy to understand and customise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same 'hello world' app that took 204kb with React and Next weighs just 7kb with Sapper. That number is likely to fall further in the future as we explore the space of optimisation possibilities, such as not shipping any JavaScript &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; for pages that aren't interactive, beyond the tiny Sapper runtime that handles client-side routing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about a more 'real world' example? Conveniently, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld&quot;&gt;RealWorld&lt;/a&gt; project, which challenges frameworks to develop an implementation of a Medium clone, gives us a way to find out. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://svelte-realworld.now.sh/&quot;&gt;Sapper implementation&lt;/a&gt; takes 39.6kb (11.8kb zipped) to render an interactive homepage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;Code-splitting isn't free — if the reference implementation used code-splitting, it would be larger still&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entire app costs 132.7kb (39.9kb zipped), which is significantly smaller than the reference React/Redux implementation at 327kb (85.7kb), but even if was as large it would &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; faster because of code-splitting. And that's a crucial point. We're told we need to code-split our apps, but if your app uses a traditional framework like React or Vue then there's a hard lower bound on the size of your initial code-split chunk — the framework itself, which is likely to be a significant portion of your total app size. With the Svelte approach, that's no longer the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But size is only part of the story. Svelte apps are also extremely performant and memory-efficient, and the framework includes powerful features that you would sacrifice if you chose a 'minimal' or 'simple' UI library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;trade-offs&quot;&gt;Trade-offs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest drawback for many developers evaluating Sapper would be 'but I like React, and I already know how to use it', which is fair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're in that camp, I'd invite you to at least try alternative frameworks. You might be pleasantly surprised! The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sveltejs/realworld&quot;&gt;Sapper RealWorld&lt;/a&gt; implementation totals 1,201 lines of source code, compared to 2,377 for the reference implementation, because you're able to express concepts very concisely using Svelte's template syntax (which &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.technology/guide#template-syntax&quot;&gt;takes all of five minutes to master&lt;/a&gt;). You get &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.technology/blog/the-zen-of-just-writing-css&quot;&gt;scoped CSS&lt;/a&gt;, with unused style removal and minification built-in, and you can use preprocessors like LESS if you want. You no longer need to use Babel. SSR is ridiculously fast, because it's just string concatenation. And we recently introduced &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.technology/guide#state-management&quot;&gt;svelte/store&lt;/a&gt;, a tiny global store that synchronises state across your component hierarchy with zero boilerplate. The worst that can happen is that you'll end up feeling vindicated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are trade-offs nonetheless. Some people have a pathological aversion to any form of 'template language', and maybe that applies to you. JSX proponents will clobber you with the 'it's just JavaScript' mantra, and therein lies React's greatest strength, which is that it is infinitely flexible. That flexibility comes with its own set of trade-offs, but we're not here to discuss those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there's &lt;em&gt;ecosystem&lt;/em&gt;. The universe around React in particular — the devtools, editor integrations, ancillary libraries, tutorials, StackOverflow answers, hell, even job opportunities — is unrivalled. While it's true that citing 'ecosystem' as the main reason to choose a tool is a sign that you're stuck on a local maximum, apt to be marooned by the rising waters of progress, it's still a major point in favour of incumbents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;roadmap&quot;&gt;Roadmap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're not at version 1.0.0 yet, and a few things may change before we get there. Once we do (soon!), there are a lot of exciting possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe the next frontier of web performance is 'whole-app optimisation'. Currently, Svelte's compiler operates at the component level, but a compiler that understood the boundaries &lt;em&gt;between&lt;/em&gt; those components could generate even more efficient code. The React team's &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/trueadm/status/944908776896978946&quot;&gt;Prepack research&lt;/a&gt; is predicated on a similar idea, and the Glimmer team is doing some interesting work in this space. Svelte and Sapper are well positioned to take advantage of these ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Glimmer, the idea of compiling components to bytecode is one that we'll probably steal in 2018. A framework like Sapper could conceivably determine which compilation mode to use based on the characteristics of your app. It could even serve JavaScript for the initial route for the fastest possible startup time, then lazily serve a bytecode interpreter for subsequent routes, resulting in the optimal combination of startup size and total app size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly, though, we want the direction of Sapper to be determined by its users. If you're the kind of developer who enjoys life on the bleeding edge and would like to help shape the future of how we build web apps, please join us on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitter.im/sveltejs/svelte&quot;&gt;Gitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;US Customs and Border Protection, a component of the Department of Homeland Security, today &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dhs.gov/publication/border-searches-electronic-devices&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; a revised &lt;span class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;CBP Directive 3340-049A_Border-Search-of-Electronic-Media.pdf&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CBP%20Directive%203340-049A_Border-Search-of-Electronic-Media.pdf&quot; type=&quot;application/pdf; length=1110939&quot;&gt;policy on Border Searches of Electronic Devices &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;and a &lt;span class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;privacy-pia-cbp008-bordersearcheselectronicdevices-january2018.pdf&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/privacy-pia-cbp008-bordersearcheselectronicdevices-january2018.pdf&quot; type=&quot;application/pdf; length=549214&quot;&gt;Privacy Impact Assessment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of some of the changes made by the new policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBP has received (and largely ignored) &lt;a href=&quot;https://knightcolumbia.org/content/knight-institute-v-dhs-foia-suit-border-searches-electronic-devices&quot;&gt;numerous complaints&lt;/a&gt; by travelers who have been detained and told they wouldn’t be allowed to go unless they told CBP the passwords to their smartphones, laptop computers, or other electronic devices. Electronic devices have been seized and copied, and in some cases returned only long afterward and/or in altered or damaged condition. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-eff-sue-over-warrantless-phone-and-laptop-searches-us-border&quot;&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; challenging suspicionless searches and seizures of data stored on travelers’ electronic devices, brought by EFF and the ACLU, is pending in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal courts have generally been overly deferential to government claims to the existence of a general exception to the Fourth Amendment making it &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt; “reasonable” to search or seize anything at or “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/other/constitution-100-mile-border-zone&quot;&gt;near&lt;/a&gt;” a border or at an international airport, regardless of whether there is any basis to suspect a traveler of anything except international travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;span class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;CBP Directive 3340-049A_Border-Search-of-Electronic-Media.pdf&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CBP%20Directive%203340-049A_Border-Search-of-Electronic-Media.pdf&quot; type=&quot;application/pdf; length=1110939&quot;&gt;new CBP policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; stretches the government’s claim of authority for warrantless, suspicionless, searches and seizures of electronic devices and data even further than its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/privacy_pia_cbp_laptop.pdf&quot;&gt;2009 predecessor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the new PIA correctly notes, “The 2009 policy was silent regarding CBP’s handling of passcode-protected or encrypted information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBP now says as follows, without citing any basis for this assertion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Travelers are obligated to present electronic devices and the information contained therein in a condition that allows inspection of the device and its contents… Passcodes or other means of entry may be requested and retained as needed&lt;/strong&gt; to facilitate the examination of an electronic device or information contained on an electronic device, including information on the device that is accessible through software applications present on the device. &lt;strong&gt;If an Officer is unable to complate an inspection of an electronic device because it is protected by a passcode or encryption, the Officer may… detain the device&lt;/strong&gt; pending a determination as to its admissibility, exclusion, or other disposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, CBP is now claiming the authority to confiscate your cellphones, laptops, memory cards, and any other electronic devices if you won’t tell CBP your passwords, and to retain the passwords you give them as well as the contents of those devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, this applies to U.S. citizens and permanent residents as well as visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-12071&quot;/&gt;The PIA admits that, as a general “Principle of Purpose Specification” for fair information practices, “DHS should specifically articulate the authority which permits the collection of PII [Personally Identifiable Information] and specifically articulate the purpose or purposes for which the PII is intended to be used.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the DHS dismisses these concerns: “There is no privacy risk to purpose specification. The legal precedent is clear, and all information is maintained, stored, and disseminated consistent with published systems of records notices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claim about this all being consistent with published notices sounds plausible and perhaps reassuring — until you look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dhs.gov/system-records-notices-sorns&quot;&gt;notices&lt;/a&gt; in question. CBP says that passwords for electronic devices, and images of data extracted from electronic devices, will be stored  in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://papersplease.org/wp/hasbrouck-v-cbp/&quot;&gt;Automated Targeting System&lt;/a&gt; (ATS). But there’s no mention of passwords or device images in the most recent (or any previous) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-05-22/html/2012-12396.htm&quot;&gt;system of records notice (SORN) for ATS&lt;/a&gt;. Nor is there any “catch-all” category in that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-05-22/html/2012-12396.htm&quot;&gt;SORN&lt;/a&gt; that would appear to include this data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the public had been given proper notice, the Privacy Act permits the collection of information about how individuals exercise rights protected by the First Amendment only if this has been &lt;em&gt;explicitly&lt;/em&gt; authorized by Federal law. No Federal statute mentions the collection by CBP or DHS of passwords for, or data from, travelers’ electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pursuant to the Privacy Act, it’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/32/505.12&quot;&gt;crime&lt;/a&gt; for a federal agency or official to maintain a system of records without having first published a SORN  giving notice of all of the categories of information included in the syatem. If CBP officials have been storing passwords to travelers electronic devices, or data obtained from those devices, in ATS, any CBP agents responsible for those actions are criminals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We won’t hold our breath waiting for these CBP officers to be prosecuted, but travelers shouldn’t think that any of this is within what is allowed by existing laws and court precedents, much less what should be allowed by the First and Fourth Amendments to the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should you do if officers of CBP or other DHS components ask you for the password to your electronic device or want to confiscate it or copy data from it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First&lt;/strong&gt;, don’t disclose your password(s) and don’t consent to any search or seizure. Telling an officer your password might be construed as giving them permission to use that password to make a complete copy of all of the data on your device.  Police at borders or elsewhere have the legal authority to conduct some searches without your consent, but you are never required to consent. That’s what “consent” means. If they are going to do it anyway, they will do it with or without your consent. Consenting to a search or seizure they are going to carry out anyway can only make your situation worse, not better. Make clear that if they search or seize your device or data, it will be a nonconsensual search. If you are given a receipt for your device(s) or some other form to fill out or sign, use it as a chance to put your denial of consent in writing in a way that will make be harder for them later to claim that you consented. Write, “I did not and I do not consent to this search or seizure.” It’s generally a bad idea to sign anything without first consulting a lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second&lt;/strong&gt;, if they ask you for your password or other data, ask them for the Paperwork Reduction Act notice including the “OMB Control Number” applicable to this collection of information. “What is the password to this device?” is a verbal collection of information, which is prohibited by the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) unless it has been approved in advance by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB),  a “control number” has been assigned by OMB, and individuals from whom information is to be collected are given notice of this. Neither CBP nor DHS has ever requested or received OMB approval for collection of device passwords or images, so these agencies are forbidden by the PRA from imposing any sanctions on individuals who decline to provide this information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third&lt;/strong&gt;, tell the officers if any or all of your devices contain privileged data, and invoke your rights under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://papersplease.org/wp/2017/02/15/searches-at-airports-and-us-borders/&quot;&gt;Privacy Protection Act&lt;/a&gt;. If you intend to post some of your photos or descriptions of events on social media, your documents and digital materials are covered by the Privacy Protection Act — but only if the officers conducting the search or seizure know that the device contains privileged information. So tell them. Consider putting a copy of this &lt;a href=&quot;https://papersplease.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/readme.pdf&quot;&gt;notice and copy of the law&lt;/a&gt; on each of your devices as a “README” file, and carrying a paper copy of at least the first page in your wallet or somewhere handy. This probably won’t stop the border cops, but it might get them to pause while they ask for higher-level approval for the search or seizure. &lt;a href=&quot;https://papersplease.org/wp/2017/02/15/searches-at-airports-and-us-borders/&quot;&gt;As we’ve discussed previously&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a partial exception to the Privacy Protection Act for &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; border searches, but it’s limited. And if they search or seize your device anyway, knowing that it contains material prvileged by the Privacy Protection Act, you can go after them personally for money damages.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>MacBook Pro? No</title>
<link>http://shahidkamal.com/macbook-pro-no/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://shahidkamal.com/macbook-pro-no/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Let me count the way my latest MacBook Pro is not suitable for professional use, but before I do that, you should know that I’ve been buying and recommending Macs since 2001. I’ve spent a fortune on them. I love them, but I only &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; my latest MacBook Pro (a 2016 model with the Radeon Pro 460). I write this with a heavy heart and a malfunctioning keyboard.  This is a story about unrequited hardware love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The keyboard on my MBP has begun to fail, with the ‘b’ key sometimes giving me doubled characters and sometimes none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cursor keys are in that awful cluster configuration where the up and down arrow keys, the ones I use the most, have half the space they should have and consequently make it next to impossible to navigate using them. Not so much cluster as clusterfuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also feel different to the other keys, less responsive, if that were possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This £2800 laptop has a distinctly unprofessional keyboard. It’s not a whole lot better than the membrane keyboard on the first computer I owned, the Atari 400 back in 1982. I wouldn’t be surprised if the travel was shorter than that on the rubber keyboard of the ZX Spectrum. I don’t mind the feel, but that’s not good enough for a £2800 laptop. I should &lt;em&gt;adore&lt;/em&gt; the keyboard. It doesn’t need much more travel, but it does need it. I don’t expect a Matias Tactile Pro, but I could do with a Magic Keyboard and I’ll take the extra thickness in return for a usable primary input method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, where’s my damned Esc key? I go for that so often, and miss. Putting it on the Touch Bar was a stupid idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? The only thing of any use is the TouchID sensor, but you don’t need a whole keyboard-level touch screen for that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a touch typist, if you’re going to have a touchable surface, it might as well be the screen. I don’t want to look at the keyboard, ever; I want to look at the screen. Looking down at that pointless strip that offers me no feedback when I interact with it and which has no delineated edges is an extra cognitive burden that I just don’t need and therefore, as a professional, never use, unless I’m forced to. You know that a design has failed when you’re forced into using it. The Touch Bar is Apple’s Clippy. An embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s too big. I never use all of that space, and I keep accidentally triggering it with my wrists when I don’t want to. Why not give the keyboard some extra height so I can have some proper cursor keys and while you’re at it, make those keys tactile and replaceable? It’s not a Wacom for crying out loud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like USB Type C, I really do, but like many people with a MacBook Pro, I have a camera and like most decent cameras, it has an SD card slot, except that Apple saw fit to remove this slot. Professional photographers have used the MacBook Pro for as long as they’ve been made. Only now, they need an accursed dongle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d understand and forgive this on a lesser machine, like one without the “Pro” moniker, but not having an SD card on this £2800 machine strikes me as totally stupid. Rather than use another expensive adapter, I just use the iMac, which makes that the professional machine, and this one just a designer’s wet dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a professional laptop, but I can’t tell it’s charging unless I open the lid, gain entry and look at the tiny power indicator in the menu bar. Which genius thought this would be a Pro touch? I know it makes a sound when you plug it in; fine, genius, but what if I didn’t hear the sound? How do I tell when it’s fully charged? You took off the MagSafe, which was a genuinely useful innovation and gave us USB C charging — fine, but add a little adapter that has a charge indicator, and yes, if you must, charge for it, though you really shouldn’t if you want to call this a “Pro”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we’re on the subject of lights, I miss the glowing Apple logo at the back of the machine. Bring that back please. Why are you cutting costs on a £2800 machine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, why don’t we get a power extension cable like we used to? Don’t know about you, but I find it hard to find power sockets near me all the time and this is just another tight move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You claim five hours. I can offer you some more realistic benchmarks. Not five. Sometimes not four. It’s a Pro machine, right? Don’t go backwards then. Give me 8 hours or give me death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Apple wants to make a MacBook Pro, they should quit with the design fundamentalism on a machine costing £2800 (£2800 is a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of money for an ordinary laptop, which apart from the display, this is) and quit with what seem like cost-cutting measures in the name of power efficiency. This machine is no doubt powerful. It never struggles with software, everything runs at a decent clip (when the power is plugged in) and it’s stable, but it’s not a Pro machine — just about any decent PC laptop at not much more than &lt;em&gt;half the price of my MacBook Pro&lt;/em&gt; will give me “Pro” functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say make it faster, make the battery bigger, make the laptop slightly thicker, make the keyboard decent (heck just make it like the Magic Keyboard), get rid of the Touch Bar, make the display a 16” 4K HDR OLED, bring back some kind of MagSafe, bring the lit Apple logo back, bring back the SD card slot, add three USB 3 slots, make the trackpad smaller, beef up the GPU so that it can handle VR and games, and make it £4000. I’ll buy it. In the meantime, drop the price on this experiment and stop calling it a Pro. It doesn’t feel any more Pro than the standard MacBook.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Tea if by sea, cha if by land: Why the world only has two words for tea</title>
<link>https://qz.com/1176962/map-how-the-word-tea-spread-over-land-and-sea-to-conquer-the-world/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://qz.com/1176962/map-how-the-word-tea-spread-over-land-and-sea-to-conquer-the-world/</guid>
<description>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a few minor exceptions, there are really only two ways to say “tea” in the world. One is like the English term—&lt;em&gt;té&lt;/em&gt; in Spanish and &lt;em&gt;tee&lt;/em&gt; in Afrikaans are two examples. The other is some variation of &lt;em&gt;cha&lt;/em&gt;, like &lt;em&gt;chay&lt;/em&gt; in Hindi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both versions come from China. How they spread around the world offers a clear picture of how globalization worked before “globalization” was a term anybody used. The words that sound like “cha” spread across land, along the Silk Road. The “tea”-like phrasings spread over water, by Dutch traders bringing the novel leaves back to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/tea-map1.png?w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/tea-map1.png?w=320 320w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/tea-map1.png?w=640 640w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/tea-map1.png?w=940 940w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/tea-map1.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/tea-map1.png?w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/tea-map1.png?w=2872&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 320px, (max-width: 640px) 640px, (max-width: 940px) 940px, 100vw&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;em&gt;cha&lt;/em&gt; (茶) is “Sinitic,” meaning it is common to many varieties of Chinese. It began in China and made its way through central Asia, eventually becoming “chay” (چای) in Persian. That is no doubt due to the trade routes of the Silk Road, along which, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/28/silk-road-even-older-than-thought-ancient-tea-suggests&quot;&gt;recent discovery&lt;/a&gt;, tea was traded over 2,000 years ago. This form spread beyond Persia, becoming &lt;em&gt;chay&lt;/em&gt; in Urdu, &lt;em&gt;shay&lt;/em&gt; in Arabic, and &lt;em&gt;chay&lt;/em&gt; in Russian, among others. It even it made its way to sub-Saharan Africa, where it became &lt;em&gt;chai&lt;/em&gt; in Swahili. The Japanese and Korean terms for tea are also based on the Chinese &lt;em&gt;cha&lt;/em&gt;, though those languages likely adopted the word even before its westward spread into Persian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t account for “tea.” The Chinese character for tea, 茶, is pronounced differently by different varieties of Chinese, though it is written the same in them all. In today’s Mandarin, it is &lt;em&gt;chá&lt;/em&gt;. But in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.omniglot.com/chinese/min.htm&quot;&gt;Min Nan&lt;/a&gt; variety of Chinese, spoken in the coastal province of Fujian, the character is pronounced &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;te&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The key word here is “coastal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;te&lt;/em&gt; form used in coastal-Chinese languages spread to Europe via the Dutch, who became the primary traders of tea between Europe and Asia in the 17th century, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://wals.info/chapter/138&quot;&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; in the World Atlas of Language Structures. The main Dutch ports in east Asia were in Fujian and Taiwan, both places where people used the &lt;em&gt;te&lt;/em&gt; pronunciation. The Dutch East India Company’s expansive tea importation into Europe gave us the French &lt;em&gt;thé&lt;/em&gt;, the German &lt;em&gt;tee&lt;/em&gt;, and the English &lt;em&gt;tea&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the Dutch were not the first to Asia. That honor belongs to the Portuguese, who are responsible for the island of Taiwan’s colonial European name, Formosa. And the Portuguese traded not through Fujian but Macao, where &lt;em&gt;chá&lt;/em&gt; is used&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; That’s why, on the map above, Portugal is a pink dot in a sea of blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few languages have their own way of talking about tea. These languages are generally in places where tea grows naturally, which led locals to develop their own way to refer to it. In Burmese, for example, tea leaves are &lt;em&gt;lakphak&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The map demonstrates two different eras of globalization in action: the millenia-old overland spread of goods and ideas westward from ancient China, and the 400-year-old influence of Asian culture on the seafaring Europeans of the age of exploration. Also, you just learned a new word in nearly every language on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook Overhauls News Feed to Focus on What Friends and Family Share</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;197&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2224&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;“When people are engaging with people they’re close to, it’s more meaningful, more fulfilling,” said David Ginsberg, director of research at Facebook. “It’s good for your well-being.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;539&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2763&quot;&gt;Facebook has been under fire for months over what it shows people and whether its site has negatively influenced millions of its users. The company has been dogged by questions about how its algorithms may have prioritized misleading news and misinformation in News Feeds, influencing the 2016 American presidential election as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/18/technology/fake-news-on-facebook-in-foreign-elections-thats-not-new.html&quot;&gt;political discourse in many countries&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/technology/facebook-russian-political-ads.html&quot;&gt;Facebook disclosed&lt;/a&gt; that Russian agents had used the social network to spread divisive and inflammatory posts and ads to polarize the American electorate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;275&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3038&quot;&gt;Those issues have landed Facebook in front of lawmakers, who have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/us/politics/facebook-twitter-google-hearings-congress.html&quot;&gt;grilled the company about its influence&lt;/a&gt; last year. Next Wednesday, Facebook is set to appear at another hearing on Capitol Hill, along with Twitter and YouTube, about the online spread of extremist propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;532&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3570&quot;&gt;The repercussions from Facebook’s new News Feed changes will almost certainly be far-reaching. Publishers, nonprofits, small business and many other groups rely on the social network to reach people, so de-emphasizing their posts will most likely hurt them. Adam Mosseri, vice president of product management at Facebook, who is responsible for running the News Feed, acknowledged that “there will be anxiety” from partners and publishers who often complain about the constant changes in what will be shown across the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;Photo&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/12/business/12FACEBOOK-1/12FACEBOOK-1-master675.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;media-viewer-candidate&quot; data-mediaviewer-src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/12/business/12FACEBOOK-1/12FACEBOOK-1-superJumbo.jpg&quot; data-mediaviewer-caption=&quot;Facebook said it would prioritize what users&amp;#x2019; friends and family share and comment on in the News Feed while de-emphasizing content from publishers and brands.&quot; data-mediaviewer-credit=&quot;&quot; itemprop=&quot;url&quot; itemid=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/12/business/12FACEBOOK-1/12FACEBOOK-1-master675.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Facebook said it would prioritize what users’ friends and family share and comment on in the News Feed while de-emphasizing content from publishers and brands.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;442&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4012&quot;&gt;The change may also work against Facebook’s immediate business interests. The company has long pushed users to spend more time on the social network. With different, less viral types of content surfacing more often, people could end up spending their time elsewhere. Mr. Zuckerberg said that was in fact Facebook’s expectation, but that if people end up feeling better about using the social network, the business will ultimately benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;513&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4525&quot;&gt;Changes to Facebook’s News Feed are not new. The Silicon Valley company constantly experiments with what shows up in the News Feed, and in the past it has also said it would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/30/technology/facebook-to-change-news-feed-to-focus-on-friends-and-family.html?_r=0&quot;&gt;prioritize posts from users’ friends and family&lt;/a&gt;. But Thursday’s shift goes beyond previous changes by prioritizing posts that have generated substantive interactions. A long comment on a family member’s photo, for instance, might be highlighted in the News Feed above a video that has fewer comments or interactions between people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;307&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4832&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;Facebook has conducted research and worked with outside academics for months to examine the effects that its service has on people. The work was spurred by criticism from politicians, academics, the media and others that Facebook had not adequately considered its responsibility for what it shows its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;417&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5249&quot;&gt;After the 2016 election, for instance, Mr. Zuckerberg initially shrugged off qualms about Facebook’s effect on the outcome, even as outsiders pointed to the proliferation of fake news stories on the site that had attacked Hillary Clinton. Mr. Zuckerberg later said he had been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104067130714241?pnref=story&quot;&gt;too hasty and dismissive of the concerns&lt;/a&gt;. More recently, he began signaling that Facebook was rethinking what it shows people on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;282&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5531&quot;&gt;Last week, he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104380170714571&quot;&gt;posted on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; about his goals for 2018, including “making sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent” and adding that “this will be a serious year of self-improvement and I’m looking forward to learning from working to fix our issues together.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;198&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5729&quot;&gt;On Thursday, he said many of the discussions about Facebook’s responsibilities had prompted the company “to get a better handle on some of the negative things that could happen in the system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;188&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5917&quot;&gt;“Just because a tool can be used for good and bad, that doesn’t make the tool bad — it just means you need to understand what the negative is so that you can mitigate it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;290&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6207&quot;&gt;Facebook and other researchers have particularly homed in on passive content. In surveys of Facebook users, people said they felt the site had shifted too far away from friends and family-related content, especially amid a swell of outside posts from brands, publishers and media companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;210&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6417&quot;&gt;“This big wave of public content has really made us reflect: What are we really here to do?” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “If what we’re here to do is help people build relationships, then we need to adjust.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;272&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6689&quot;&gt;Mr. Zuckerberg said he was now focusing his company around the new approach. Product managers are being asked to “facilitate the most meaningful interactions between people,” rather than the previous mandate of helping people find the most meaningful content, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;262&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6951&quot;&gt;Mr. Zuckerberg added that his way of running Facebook has shifted since the birth of his two daughters, Maxima and August, in recent years. He said he had rethought the way he views his and Facebook’s legacy, even if it will cost the company in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>YC Bio</title>
<link>https://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-bio/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-bio/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-content&quot; readability=&quot;65.203905801264&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m excited to announce a new experiment we’re going to try: YC Bio. YC Bio is a new way for us to fund early-stage life science companies that are still in the lab phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because biology is such a large field, we’re going to try concentrating on one sub-area at a time (we’ve found the companies working in similar areas get a lot of value from being around each other). The first area we’re going to focus on is healthspan and age-related disease—we think there’s an enormous opportunity to help people live healthier for longer, and that it could be one of the best ways to address our healthcare crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve been funding bio companies for a little while now, and we’ve learned a bit about what works and doesn’t. We will try to design the program in light of what we’ve learned, and almost certainly we’ll make a lot of changes as we go along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be a special track like YC AI—the companies will go through the regular YC batch, but there will be a few differences. Instead of the standard deal for YC companies (which is $120,000 invested for 7% ownership) we’ll offer these companies any amount between $500k and $1 million for 10-20% ownership, scaling linearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll also offer the companies free lab space (we’re still looking for one lab space partner, and we’d love for interested partners to get in touch.) In addition, we’ll have a number of other special deals for YC bio companies, and access to a wide range of experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a specific RFS in our application system for companies to indicate they’re interested in this system. Other bio companies are of course welcome to apply for the standard YC program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:ycbio@ycombinator.com&quot;&gt;ycbio@ycombinator.com&lt;/a&gt; with any questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Protecting Google Cloud customers without impacting performance</title>
<link>https://www.blog.google/topics/google-cloud/protecting-our-google-cloud-customers-new-vulnerabilities-without-impacting-performance/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+blogspot%2FMKuf+%28The+Keyword+%7C+Official+Google+Blog%29</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.blog.google/topics/google-cloud/protecting-our-google-cloud-customers-new-vulnerabilities-without-impacting-performance/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FMKuf+%28The+Keyword+%7C+Official+Google+Blog%29</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been keeping up on the latest tech news, you’ve undoubtedly heard about the CPU security flaw that &lt;a href=&quot;https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html&quot;&gt;Google’s Project Zero disclosed&lt;/a&gt; last Wednesday. On Friday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.google/topics/google-cloud/answering-your-questions-about-meltdown-and-spectre/&quot;&gt;we answered some of your questions&lt;/a&gt; and detailed how we are protecting Cloud customers. Today, we’d like to go into even more detail on how we’ve protected Google Cloud products against these speculative execution vulnerabilities, and what we did to make sure our Google Cloud customers saw minimal performance impact from these mitigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern CPUs and operating systems protect programs and users by putting a “wall&quot; around them so that one application, or user, can’t read what’s stored in another application’s memory. These boundaries are enforced by the CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as we disclosed last week, Project Zero discovered techniques that can circumvent these protections in some cases, allowing one application to read the private memory of another, potentially exposing sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vulnerabilities come in three variants, each of which must be protected against individually. Variant 1 and Variant 2 have also been referred to as “Spectre.” Variant 3 has been referred to as “Meltdown.” Project Zero &lt;a href=&quot;https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html&quot;&gt;described these in technical detail&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://security.googleblog.com/&quot;&gt;Google Security blog&lt;/a&gt; described how we’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://security.googleblog.com/2018/01/todays-cpu-vulnerability-what-you-need.html&quot;&gt;protecting users across all Google products&lt;/a&gt;, and we explained how we’re protecting Google Cloud customers and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.google/topics/google-cloud/answering-your-questions-about-meltdown-and-spectre/&quot;&gt;provided guidance on security best practices for customers who use their own operating systems&lt;/a&gt; with Google Cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, these vulnerabilities have been present in most computers for nearly 20 years. Because the vulnerabilities exploit features that are foundational to most modern CPUs—and were previously believed to be secure—they weren’t just hard to find, they were even harder to fix. For months, hundreds of engineers across Google and other companies worked continuously to understand these new vulnerabilities and find mitigations for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, we began deploying solutions for both Variants 1 and 3 to the production infrastructure that underpins all Google products—from Cloud services to Gmail, Search and Drive—and more-refined solutions in October. Thanks to extensive performance tuning work, these protections caused no perceptible impact in our cloud and required no customer downtime in part due to Google Cloud Platform’s Live Migration technology. No GCP customer or internal team has reported any performance degradation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While those solutions addressed Variants 1 and 3, it was clear from the outset that Variant 2 was going to be much harder to mitigate. For several months, it appeared that disabling the vulnerable CPU features would be the only option for protecting all our workloads against Variant 2. While that was certain to work, it would also disable key performance-boosting CPU features, thus slowing down applications considerably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only did we see considerable slowdowns for many applications, we also noticed inconsistent performance, since the speed of one application could be impacted by the behavior of other applications running on the same core. Rolling out these mitigations would have negatively impacted many customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the performance characteristics uncertain, we started looking for a “moonshot”—a way to mitigate Variant 2 without hardware support. Finally, inspiration struck in the form of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7625886&quot;&gt;Retpoline&lt;/a&gt;”—a novel software binary modification technique that prevents branch-target-injection, created by Paul Turner, a software engineer who is part of our Technical Infrastructure group. With Retpoline, we didn't need to disable speculative execution or other hardware features. Instead, this solution modifies programs to ensure that execution cannot be influenced by an attacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Retpoline, we could protect our infrastructure at compile-time, with no source-code modifications. Furthermore, testing this feature, particularly when combined with optimizations such as software branch prediction hints, demonstrated that this protection came with almost no performance loss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We immediately began deploying this solution across our infrastructure. In addition to sharing the technique with industry partners upon its creation, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7625886&quot;&gt;open-sourced&lt;/a&gt; our compiler implementation in the interest of protecting all users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By December, all Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services had protections in place for all known variants of the vulnerability. During the entire update process, nobody noticed: we received no customer support tickets related to the updates. This confirmed our internal assessment that in real-world use, the performance-optimized updates Google deployed do not have a material effect on workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that Retpoline-based protection is the best-performing solution for Variant 2 on current hardware. Retpoline fully protects against Variant 2 without impacting customer performance on all of our platforms. In sharing our research publicly, we hope that this can be universally deployed to improve the cloud experience industry-wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of vulnerabilities was perhaps the most challenging and hardest to fix in a decade, requiring changes to many layers of the software stack. It also required broad industry collaboration since the scope of the vulnerabilities was so widespread. Because of the extreme circumstances of extensive impact and the complexity involved in developing fixes, the response to this issue has been one of the few times that Project Zero made &lt;a href=&quot;https://security.googleblog.com/2015/02/feedback-and-data-driven-updates-to.html&quot;&gt;an exception to its 90-day disclosure policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these vulnerabilities represent a new class of attack, they're just a few among the many different types of threats our infrastructure is designed to defend against every day. Our infrastructure includes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/cloud/security/infrastructure/&quot;&gt;mitigations by design and defense-in-depth&lt;/a&gt;, and we’re committed to ongoing research and contributions to the security community and to protecting our customers as new vulnerabilities are discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/4529280Z:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Dropbox Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, the file-sharing private company valued at $10 billion, has filed confidentially for a U.S. initial public offering, people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GS:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/JPM:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co.&lt;/a&gt; will lead the potential listing, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the filing wasn’t public. Dropbox is talking to other banks this month to fill additional roles on the IPO, the people said. The company is aiming to list in the first half of this year, one of the people said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Representatives for Dropbox, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;A share sale by San Francisco-based Dropbox, one of a closely watched group of high-profile private tech companies with multibillion-dollar valuations, would follow Snap Inc.’s disappointing step into the public markets. How the stock fares post-listing will be an ongoing focus for both Wall Street and the tech community. Snap shares are down 15 percent from its IPO last March.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike money-losing Snap, Dropbox will come to the table with &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-10/dropbox-has-whipped-itself-into-shape-but-going-public-won-t-be-easy&quot; title=&quot;Dropbox Has Whipped Itself Into Shape, but Going Public Won’t Be Easy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;annualized sales&lt;/a&gt; of more than $1 billion, Chief Executive Officer Drew Houston said in an interview last year. It’s also been profitable, excluding interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Those benchmarks are the product of more than two years of focusing the company, expanding its product suite for businesses and reining in expenses, Houston said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ADT, Spotify&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dropbox could be one of the biggest U.S. enterprise technology companies to list domestically in recent years. First Data Corp. went public at a market value of about $14 billion in 2015 -- the biggest such IPO in the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dropbox joins a growing list of large tech companies preparing to go public in the U.S. early this year. Apollo Global Management LLC’s security company &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/ADT:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;ADT Inc.&lt;/a&gt; is aiming to raise as much as &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-05/apollo-s-adt-seeks-to-raise-up-to-2-1-billion-in-u-s-ipo&quot; title=&quot;Apollo’s ADT Seeks to Raise Up to $2.1 Billion in U.S. IPO&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$2.1 billion&lt;/a&gt; in an IPO expected to price on Jan. 18. Spotify, owner of the world’s largest paid music service, plans to execute its unconventional direct listing this quarter, a person familiar with the matter said this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-public filings have become more common since July, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission began &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-30/sec-to-expand-confidential-ipo-filing-ability-to-all-companies&quot; title=&quot;SEC to Make Confidential IPO Filing Open to All Companies (2)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;allowing&lt;/a&gt; all companies to file early IPO documents confidentially -- a perk previously reserved for smaller businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dropbox achieved its $10 billion private valuation in its last private funding round in 2014. While it’s uncertain whether the company will be able to initially sell shares above that valuation, the stock could trade higher once it’s public, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cloud Pitch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of August, Dropbox had 500 million users, including 200,000 businesses, storing and sharing files online through its cloud service. The service lets companies keep documents in a commonly accessible place without having to build their own server farms. The company will have to show potential investors how it’s differentiating its core file-sharing products and newer collaboration tools from the likes of Google, Microsoft Corp. and &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BOX:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Box Inc.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dropbox is likely to tout its biggest investment in recent years: its own cloud. It’s spent hundreds of millions of dollars to build data centers and mostly wean itself off of Amazon.com Inc.’s servers, a rare feat for a software business with hundreds of millions of users. That’s made it easier for Dropbox to cut costs while speeding file transfers, Chief Operating Officer Dennis Woodside said in an &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-10/dropbox-has-whipped-itself-into-shape-but-going-public-won-t-be-easy&quot; title=&quot;Dropbox Has Whipped Itself Into Shape, but Going Public Won’t Be Easy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two lead banks have a history of working with Dropbox. Goldman Sachs advised the company on earlier funding rounds and extended the company credit, while JPMorgan led a $600 million credit line to Dropbox last year, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking on the risk of lending to a private company can typically help a firm’s chances in underwriting an eventual IPO. JPMorgan led a &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-30/dropbox-secures-600-million-credit-line-ahead-of-expected-ipo&quot; title=&quot;Dropbox Said to Secure $600 Million Credit Line Led by JPMorgan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;credit line&lt;/a&gt; extended to Dropbox, along with Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Corp., Deutsche Bank AG, Macquarie Group Ltd. and Royal Bank of Canada, people familiar with the matter said last March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had been helping the company &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-27/dropbox-is-said-likely-to-hire-goldman-sachs-for-possible-ipo&quot; title=&quot;Dropbox Is Said to Be Expected to Hire Goldman for IPO Plans (1)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;prepare&lt;/a&gt; IPO documents.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>House Votes to Renew Surveillance Law, Rejecting New Privacy Limits</title>

<description>&lt;p itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;“House votes on controversial FISA ACT today.” This is the act that may have been used, with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier, to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;With that being said, I have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office and today’s vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land. We need it! Get smart!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;House votes 256-164 to expand Trump's warrantless surveillance powers for the next six years. The vote to reform warrantless searches of Americans' phone calls and e-mails failed, needing the support of 26 more. Dems could have swung it, but 55 of them voted with the Trump camp.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

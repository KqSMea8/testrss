<title>Ending PHP Support, and the Future of Hack</title>
<link>https://hhvm.com/blog/2018/09/12/end-of-php-support-future-of-hack.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://hhvm.com/blog/2018/09/12/end-of-php-support-future-of-hack.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;HHVM v3.30 will be the last release series where HHVM aims to support PHP. The key dates are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2018-12-03: branch cut: expect PHP code to stop working with master and nightly builds after this date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2018-12-17: expected release date for v3.30.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2019-01-28: expected release date for v4.0.0, without PHP support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2019-11-19: expected end of support for v3.30&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we recommend that projects either migrate entirely to the Hack language, or entirely to PHP7 and the PHP runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect support for real-world PHP code to break rapidly: for example, we are likely to replace reference parameters (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;$foo&lt;/code&gt;) to builtins with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;inout&lt;/code&gt; parameters, make &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;INT64_MAX + 1 === INT64_MIN&lt;/code&gt; (instead of a float), among other changes. In the short term, we expect it to be fairly straightforward to migrate code to deal with these changes, but this will require that any dependencies written in PHP are either forked and migrated to Hack, or migrated away from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re extremely grateful to the users and developers of PHP, and are glad to have been part of those communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are proud of Hack, but there are still many areas where we want to make major improvements to the language; during the next 2-3 years, we will be working towards making Hack a language that builds on the best parts of its’ heritage to produce:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a consistent, statically typed language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the development speed and ease-of-use that’s traditionally associated with dynamically typed languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;During these 2-3 years, aggressive growth of our user base is not a primary goal: we want most people’s first exposure to Hack to be the improved language that we are working towards. However, we will be increasing our investment in Hack/HHVM open source, to continue to support our existing users, and aim to build a community ready to support growth in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we expect the language to evolve rapidly, we &lt;strong&gt;strongly&lt;/strong&gt; recommend using the regular releases instead of the LTS releases for large projects; while this does mean you need to upgrade more often, both us and our users have found that it is generally easier to catch up on 2 months worth of changes 3 times as often than 6 months of changes in one go. We will also be re-evaluating the length of our release cycle; one possibility is that we will move to releases every 4 weeks, with these releases being supported for 6-8 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this time period, most of Facebook’s Hack libraries and tools on GitHub will only target the latest release, not LTS versions; branches and fixes will be made as-needed, but these branches will be community supported, except for security issues reported via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/whitehat&quot;&gt;Facebook’s Whitehat Program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The priorities of the Hack/HHVM open source team are to support our existing users, and to reduce the pain of the removal of PHP support. This will involve creating additional projects, and polishing several existing projects to reach a state suitable for v1.x.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, plans include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hhvm/hh-apidoc&quot;&gt;hh-apidoc&lt;/a&gt;: improve ease of use, integrate with existing projects, improve readability and formatting of produced documents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hhvm/hacktest&quot;&gt;hacktest&lt;/a&gt;: improve ease of use, documentation, and use as a replacement for PHPUnit in all our existing projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hhvm/hack-router&quot;&gt;hack-router&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hhvm/hack-router-codegen&quot;&gt;hack-router-codegen&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebookexperimental/hack-http-request-response-interfaces/&quot;&gt;remove the dependency on PSR-7&lt;/a&gt;, revisit the API design for current best practices, improve documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we are investigating migrating away from Composer and Packagist; it currently seems likely that this is going to be a set of best practices or extensions to &lt;a href=&quot;https://yarnpkg.com/&quot;&gt;Yarn&lt;/a&gt;, using the NPM repository, with the goal of using a single package manager for both the JS and Hack parts of web-based projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hope to help the community build what is needed; please get in contact via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/hhvm.general/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/hacklang&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hacklang/&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, or in #hhvm on irc.freenode.net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, we expect this work to continue and expand in scope, and to provide more automated migrations to update code to deal with language changes.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Manhattan DA&amp;#039;s office drops more than 3,000 open marijuana cases</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-york-marijuana/manhattan-das-office-drops-more-than-3000-open-marijuana-cases-idUSKCN1LS2ID</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-york-marijuana/manhattan-das-office-drops-more-than-3000-open-marijuana-cases-idUSKCN1LS2ID</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance on Wednesday dropped more than 3,000 open marijuana smoking and possession cases dating back to 1978, saying the action would serve justice and address racial disparities in the prosecution of marijuana offenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PrimaryAsset_container&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. speaks at a news conference about dismissing some 3,000 marijunana smoking and possession cases in New York City, U.S., September 12, 2018. REUTERS/Jeenah Moon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vance moved to vacate 3,042 outstanding warrants and dismiss the underlying charges before New York City Criminal Court Judge Kevin McGrath. The judge said the cases must be sealed within 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The district attorney’s decision applies to misdemeanor and violation cases in which a warrant was issued because the defendant failed to appear in court. It does not apply to any cases where a defendant was convicted, or to more serious charges like selling marijuana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By vacating these warrants, we are preventing unnecessary future interactions with the criminal justice system,” Vance said in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We made the decision that it is really in the interest of justice,” Vance said at a press conference in court after making his motion. He added that dropping the charges would remove a burden from his office and the court system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have to actually look at what resources we have, what resources the court has,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vance announced earlier this year that his office would no longer prosecute marijuana smoking and possession cases. The decision was part of a nationwide trend among state and local governments to ease enforcement or legalize the drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marijuana remains illegal at the federal level.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google’s first all-hands after 2016 election [video]</title>
<link>https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/09/12/leaked-video-google-leaderships-dismayed-reaction-to-trump-election/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/09/12/leaked-video-google-leaderships-dismayed-reaction-to-trump-election/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;A video recorded by Google shortly after the 2016 presidential election reveals an atmosphere of panic and dismay amongst the tech giant’s leadership, coupled with a determination to thwart both the Trump agenda and the broader populist movement emerging around the globe.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video is a full recording of Google’s first all-hands meeting following the 2016 election (these weekly meetings are known inside the company as “TGIF” or “Thank God It’s Friday” meetings). Sent to Breitbart News by an anonymous source, it features co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, VPs Kent Walker and Eileen Naughton, CFO Ruth Porat, and CEO Sundar Pichai. It can be watched in full above. It can and should be watched in full above in order to get the full context of the meeting and the statements made.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/09/10/silent-donation-corporate-emails-reveal-google-executives-efforts-to-swing-election-to-hillary-clinton-with-latino-outreach-campaign/&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week that Google tried to boost turnout among the Latino population to help Hillary Clinton, only to be dismayed as the usually solid Democratic voting bloc switched to the GOP in record numbers. This video shows a similar level of dismay among Google’s most high-profile figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These individuals, who preside over a company with unrivaled influence over the flow of information, can be seen disparaging the motivations of Trump voters and plotting ways to use their vast resources to thwart the Trump agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-founder Sergey Brin can be heard comparing Trump supporters to fascists and extremists. Brin argues that like other extremists, Trump voters were motivated by “boredom,” which he says in the past led to fascism and communism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Google co-founder then asks his company to consider what it can do to ensure a “better quality of governance and decision-making.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VP for Global Affairs Kent Walker argues that supporters of populist causes like the Trump campaign are motivated by “fear, xenophobia, hatred, and a desire for answers that may or may not be there.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Later, Walker says that Google should fight to ensure the populist movement – not just in the U.S. but around the world – is merely a “blip” and a “hiccup” in a historical arc that “bends toward progress.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEO Sundar Pichai states that the company will develop machine learning and A.I. to combat what an employee described as “misinformation” shared by “low-information voters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key moments from the video can be found at the following timestamps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;(00:00:00 – 00:01:12) Google co-founder Sergey Brin states that the weekly meeting is “probably not the most joyous we’ve had” and that “most people here are pretty upset and pretty sad.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(00:00:24) Brin contrasts the disappointment of Trump’s election with his excitement at the legalization of cannabis in California, triggering laughs and applause from the audience of Google employees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(00:01:12) Returning to seriousness, Brin says he is “deeply offen[ded]” by the election of Trump, and that the election “conflicts with many of [Google’s] values.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(00:09:10) Trying to explain the motivations of Trump supporters, Senior VP for Global Affairs, Kent Walker concludes: “fear, not just in the United States, but around the world is fueling concerns, xenophobia, hatred, and a desire for answers that may or may not be there.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(00:09:35) Walker goes on to describe the Trump phenomenon as a sign of “tribalism that’s self-destructive [in] the long-term.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(00:09:55) Striking an optimistic tone, Walker assures Google employees that despite the election, “history is on our side” and that the “moral arc of history bends towards progress.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(00:10:45) Walker approvingly quotes former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s comparison between “the world of the wall” with its “isolation and defensiveness” and the “world of the square, the piazza, the marketplace, where people come together into a community and enrich each other’s lives.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(00:13:10) CFO Ruth Porat appears to break down in tears when discussing the election result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(00:15:20) Porat promises that Google will “use the great strength and resources and reach we have to continue to advance really important values.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(00:16:50) Stating “we all need a hug,” she then instructs the audience of Google employees to hug the person closest to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(00:20:24) Eileen Naughton, VP of People Operations, promises that Google’s policy team in DC is “all over” the immigration issue and that the company will “keep a close watch on it.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(00:21:26) Naughton jokes about Google employees asking, ‘Can I move to Canada?’ after the election. She goes on to seriously discuss the options available to Google employees who wish to leave the country.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(00:23:12) Naughton does acknowledge “diversity of opinion and political persuasion” and notes that she has heard from conservative Google employees who say they “haven’t felt entirely comfortable revealing who [they] are.” and urged “tolerance.” (Several months later, the company would fire James Damore allegedly for disagreeing with progressive narratives.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(00:27:00) Responding to a question about “filter bubbles,” Sundar Pichai promises to work towards “correcting” Google’s role in them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(00:27:30) Sergey Brin praises an audience member’s suggestion of increasing matched Google employee donations to progressive groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(00:34:40) Brin compares Trump voters to “extremists,” arguing for a correlation between the economic background of Trump supporters and the kinds of voters who back extremist movements. Brin says that “voting is not a rational act” and that not all of Trump’s support can be attributed to “income disparity.” He suggests that Trump voters might have been motivated by boredom rather than legitimate concerns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(00:49:10) An employee asks if Google is willing to “invest in grassroots, hyper-local efforts to bring tools and services and understanding of Google products and knowledge” so that people can “make informed decisions that are best for themselves.” Pichai’s response: Google will ensure its “educational products” reach “segments of the population [they] are not [currently] fully reaching.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(00:54:33) An employee asks what Google is going to do about “misinformation” and “fake news” shared by “low-information voters.” Pichai responds by stating that “investments in machine learning and AI” are a “big opportunity” to fix the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(00:56:12) Responding to an audience member, Walker says Google must ensure the rise of populism doesn’t turn into “a world war or something catastrophic … and instead is a blip, a hiccup.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(00:58:22) Brin compares Trump voters to supporters of fascism and communism, linking the former movement to “boredom,” which Brin previously linked to Trump voters. “It sort of sneaks up sometimes, really bad things” says Brin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(01:01:15) A Google employee states: “speaking to white men, there’s an opportunity for you right now to understand your privilege” and urges employees to “go through the bias-busting training, read about privilege, read about the real history of oppression in our country.” He urges employees to “discuss the issues you are passionate about during Thanksgiving dinner and don’t back down and laugh it off when you hear the voice of oppression speak through metaphors.” Every executive on stage – the CEO, CFO, two VPs and the two Co-founders – applaud the employee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(01:01:57) An audience member asks if the executives see “anything positive from this election result.” The audience of Google employees, and the executives on stage, burst into laughter. “Boy, that’s a really tough one right now” says Brin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update —&lt;/strong&gt; After Breitbart News published this article, a Google spokesperson replied to a request for comment with the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;gmail-docs-internal-guid-f386b419-7fff-b420-b3b6-04227e966676&quot;&gt;“At a regularly scheduled all hands meeting, some Google employees and executives expressed their own personal views in the aftermath of a long and divisive election season. For over 20 years, everyone at Google has been able to freely express their opinions at these meetings. Nothing was said at that meeting, or any other meeting, to suggest that any political bias ever influences the way we build or operate our products. To the contrary, our products are built for everyone, and we design them with extraordinary care to be a trustworthy source of information for everyone, without regard to political viewpoint.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Today, Europe Lost The Internet. Now, We Fight Back</title>
<link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/09/today-europe-lost-internet-now-we-fight-back</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/09/today-europe-lost-internet-now-we-fight-back</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today, in a vote that split almost every major EU party, Members of the European Parliament adopted every terrible proposal in the new Copyright Directive and rejected every good one, setting the stage for mass, automated surveillance and arbitrary censorship of the internet: text messages like tweets and Facebook updates; photos; videos; audio; software code -- any and all media that can be copyrighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three proposals passed the European Parliament, each of them catastrophic for free expression, privacy, and the arts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Article 13: the Copyright Filters. All but the smallest platforms will have to defensively adopt copyright filters that examine everything you post and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/09/how-eus-copyright-filters-will-make-it-trivial-anyone-censor-internet&quot;&gt;censor anything judged to be a copyright infringement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Article 11: Linking to the news using more than &lt;em&gt;one word&lt;/em&gt; from the article is prohibited unless you're using a service that bought a license from the news site you want to link to. News sites can charge anything they want for the right to quote them or refuse to sell altogether, effectively giving them the right to choose who can criticise them. Member states are permitted, but not required, to create exceptions and limitations to reduce the harm done by this new right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Article 12a: No posting your own photos or videos of sports matches. Only the &quot;organisers&quot; of sports matches will have the right to publicly post any kind of record of the match. No posting your selfies, or short videos of exciting plays. You are the audience, your job is to sit where you're told, passively watch the game and go home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the EU &lt;em&gt;rejected&lt;/em&gt; even the most modest proposals to make copyright suited to the twenty-first century:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. No &quot;freedom of panorama.&quot; When we take photos or videos in public spaces, we're apt to incidentally capture copyrighted works: from stock art in ads on the sides of buses to t-shirts worn by protestors, to building facades claimed by architects as their copyright. The EU &lt;em&gt;rejected&lt;/em&gt; a proposal that would make it legal Europe-wide to photograph street scenes without worrying about infringing the copyright of objects in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. No &quot;user-generated content&quot; exemption, which would have made EU states carve out an exception to copyright for using excerpts from works for &quot;criticism, review, illustration, caricature, parody or pastiche.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've spent much of the summer talking to people who are delighted with this outcome, trying to figure out why they think this could possibly be good for them. Here's what I've discovered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;* They don't understand filters. They really don't&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entertainment industry has convinced creators that there is a technology out there that can identify copyrighted works and prevent them from being shown without a proper license and that the only thing holding us back is the stubbornness of the platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that filters primarily stop legitimate users (including creators) from doing legitimate things, while actual infringers find them relatively easy to get around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put it this way: if your occupation is figuring out how filters work and tinkering with getting around them, you can become skilled in the art. The filters used by the Chinese government to block images, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/2018/08/cant-picture-this-an-analysis-of-image-filtering-on-wechat-moments/&quot;&gt;can be defeated&lt;/a&gt; by simple measures. Meanwhile, these filters that are bound to be thousands of times more effective than any copyright filter because they're doing a much more modest job with far more money and technical talent on hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you're a professional photographer, or just a regular person posting your own work, there's no time in your life to become a hardcore filter-warrior. When a filter mistakes your work for copyright infringement, you can't just bypass the filter with a trick from the copyright infringing underground: you have to send an appeal to the platform that blocked you, getting in line behind millions of other poor suckers in the same situation as you. Cross your fingers and hope that the overworked human reviewing the appeals decides that you're in the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the big entertainment and news companies aren't worried about this outcome: they have backchannels direct into the platforms, priority access to help-lines that will unstick their content when it gets stuck in a filter. Creators who align themselves with large entertainment corporations will be shielded from filters -- while independents (and the public) will have to fend for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;* They grossly underestimate the importance of competition for improving their lot in life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building the filters the EU just mandated will cost hundreds of millions of dollars. There are precious few companies in the world who have that kind of capital: the US-based tech giants, and the Chinese-based tech giants, and a few others, like Russia's VK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mandate to filter the Internet puts a floor on how small the pieces can be when antitrust regulators want to break up the big platforms: only the largest companies can afford to police the whole net for infringement, so the largest companies can't be made much smaller. The latest version of the Directive has exemptions for smaller companies, but they will have to stay small or constantly anticipate the day that they will have to take the leap to being copyright police. Today, the EU voted to increase the consolidation in the tech sector, and to make it vastly more difficult to function as an independent creator. We’re seeing two major industries, both with competitiveness problems, negotiate for a deal that works for them, but will decrease competition for the independent creator caught in the middle. What we needed were solutions to tackle the consolidation of both the tech and the creative industries: instead we got a compromise that works for them, but shuts out everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did this terrible state of affairs come to pass?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not hard to understand, alas. The Internet has become a part of everything we do, and so every problem we have has some intersection with the Internet. For people who don't understand technology very well, there's a natural way to solve those problems: &quot;fix the technology.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arthur C Clarke famously said that &quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&quot; Some technological accomplishments do seem like magic, and it's natural to witness these workaday miracles and assume that tech can do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An inability to understand what tech can and can't do is the source of &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/1425/&quot;&gt;endless mischief&lt;/a&gt;: from the people who blithely &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/09/04/election-results-voting-system/&quot;&gt;assert that networked voting machines can be made secure&lt;/a&gt; enough to run a national election; to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about/national-security/five-country-ministerial-2018/access-evidence-encryption&quot;&gt;officials who insist&lt;/a&gt; that we can make cryptography that stops crooks from breaking into our data, but allows the police to break into crooks' data; to the hand-waving insistence that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-45495960&quot;&gt;a post-Brexit Irish border can be &quot;solved&quot; with some undefined technical fix.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a few powerful entertainment industry figures were persuaded that filtering at scale was possible and consequence-free, it became an article of faith, and when technologists (including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/06/internet-luminaries-ring-alarm-eu-copyright-filtering-proposal&quot;&gt;a who's who of the world's top experts on the subject&lt;/a&gt;) say it's not possible, they're accused of mulish stubbornness and lack of vision, not a well-informed perspective on what is and isn't possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a familiar-enough pattern, but in the case of the EU's Copyright Directive, there were exacerbating factors. Tying a proposal for copyright filters to a proposal to transfer a few million euros from tech giants to newspaper proprietors guaranteed favorable coverage from the very press looking for a solution to its problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there's the problem that the Internet promotes a kind of tunnel vision in which we assume that the part of the net we interact with is the whole thing. The Internet handles trillions of articles of public communication every day: birthday wishes and messages of condolences, notices of upcoming parties and meetings, political campaigns and love notes. A tiny, sub-one-percent slice of those communications are the kind of copyright infringement that Article 13 seeks to address, but the advocates for Article 13 keep insisting that the &quot;primary purpose&quot; of the platforms is to convey copyrighted works of entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no doubt that people from the entertainment industry interact with a lot of entertainment works online, in the same way that the police see a lot of people using the Internet to plan crimes and fashionistas see a lot of people using the Internet to show off their outfits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet is more vast than any of us can know, but that doesn't mean we should be indifferent to all the other Internet users and the things they lose when we pursue our own narrow goals at the expense of the wider electronic world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's Copyright Directive vote not only makes life harder for creators, handing a larger share of their incomes to Big Content and Big Tech -- it makes life harder for all of us. Yesterday, a policy specialist for a creator's union that I'm a member of told me that their job isn't to &quot;protect people who want to quote Shakespeare&quot; (who might be thwarted by bogus registration of his works in the copyright filters) -- it was to protect the interests of the photographers in the union whose work is being &quot;ripped off.&quot; Not only did my union's support of this catastrophic proposal do no good for photographers -- it will also do enormous damage to anyone whose communications are caught in the crossfire. An error rate of even one percent will still mean tens of millions of acts of arbitrary censorship, every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is to be done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practically speaking, there are several more junctures where Europeans can influence their elected leaders on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Immediately: the Directive will now go into &quot;trilogues&quot; -- secretive, closed-door meetings between representatives from national governments and the European Union; these will be hard to influence, but they will determine the final language put before the Parliament for the next vote (Difficulty: 10/10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Next spring: The European Parliament will vote on the language that comes out of the trilogues. It's unlikely that they'll be able to revise the text any further, so this will probably come to a vote on whether to pass the Directive itself. It's very difficult to defeat the Directive at this stage. = (Difficulty: 8/10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* After that: 28 member states will have to debate and enact their own versions of the legislation. In many ways, it's going to be harder to influence 28 individual parliaments than it was to fix this at the EU level, but on the other hand, the parliamentarians in member states will be more responsive to individual Internet users, and victories in one country can be leveraged for others (&quot;See, they got it right in Luxembourg, let's do the same”) (Difficulty: 7/10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Somewhere around there: Court challenges. Given the far-reaching nature of these proposals, the vested interests involved, and the unresolved questions about how to balance all the rights implicated, we can expect this to rise — eventually — to the European Court of Justice. Unfortunately, court challenges are slow and expensive. (Difficulty: 7/10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, there are upcoming EU elections, in which EU politicians will have to fight for their jobs. There aren't many places where a prospective Member of the European Parliament can win an election by boasting about expansions of copyright, but there are lots of potential electoral opponents who will be too happy to campaign on &quot;Vote for me, my opponent just broke the Internet.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we've seen with Net Neutrality in the USA, the movement to protect the free and open Internet has widespread popular support and can turn into a potential third rail for politicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, this was never going to be a fight we &quot;won&quot; once and for all -- the fight to keep the Internet free, fair and open is ongoing. For so long as people have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) problems; that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) intersect with the Internet;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there will always be calls to break the Internet to solve them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We suffered a crushing setback today, but it doesn't change the mission. To fight, and fight, and fight, to keep the Internet open and free and fair, to preserve it as a place where we can organise to fight the other fights that matter, about inequality and antitrust, race and gender, speech and democratic legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this vote had gone the other way, we'd still be fighting today. And tomorrow. And the day after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fight to preserve and restore the free, fair and open Internet is a fight you commit yourself to, not a fight that you win. The stakes are too high to do otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The United States Is Now the Largest Global Crude Oil Producer</title>
<link>https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37053&amp;src</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37053&amp;src</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;white_box green_top&quot; readability=&quot;45.819154107924&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;September 12, 2018&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/images/2018.09.12/main.png&quot; alt=&quot;monthly crude oil production&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States likely surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the world’s largest crude oil producer earlier this year, based on preliminary estimates in EIA’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Short-Term Energy Outlook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (STEO). In February, U.S. crude oil production exceeded that of Saudi Arabia for the first time in more than two decades. In June and August, the United States surpassed Russia in crude oil production for the first time since February 1999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although EIA does not publish crude oil production forecasts for Russia and Saudi Arabia in STEO, EIA expects that U.S. crude oil production will continue to exceed Russian and Saudi Arabian crude oil production for the remaining months of 2018 and through 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. crude oil production, particularly from light sweet crude oil grades, has rapidly increased since 2011. Much of the recent growth has occurred in areas such as the Permian region in western Texas and eastern New Mexico, the Federal Offshore Gulf of Mexico, and the Bakken region in North Dakota and Montana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil price decline in mid-2014 resulted in U.S. producers reducing their costs and temporarily scaling back crude oil production. However, after crude oil prices increased in early 2016, investment and production began increasing later that year. By comparison, Russia and Saudi Arabia have maintained relatively steady crude oil production growth in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia's crude oil and other liquids production data are EIA internal estimates. Russian data mainly come from the Russian Ministry of Oil, which publishes crude oil and condensate numbers. Other sources used to inform these estimates include data from major producing companies, international organizations (such as the International Energy Agency), and industry publications, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principal contributors:&lt;/strong&gt; Candace Dunn, Tim Hess&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google is discontinuing Inbox</title>
<link>https://www.fastcompany.com/90235559/inbox-googles-playground-for-email-innovation-is-going-bye-bye</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.fastcompany.com/90235559/inbox-googles-playground-for-email-innovation-is-going-bye-bye</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;15.759197324415&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2014, the folks at Google responsible for Gmail did something unexpected: They introduced a new email app. On the back end, Inbox was the same thing as Gmail, and worked with your existing Gmail address. But as a user experience, as then senior VP Sundar Pichai explained in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/an-inbox-that-works-for-you/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Inbox was “designed to focus on what really matters.” It was conceived with mobile devices in mind and ditched a decade’s worth of Gmail cruft in favor of tools focused on email efficiency, such as the way it displayed attachments right in the inbox view and incorporated a built-in task manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;33.0495915986&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the subsequent years, Inbox been a proving ground for features—such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/product/smart-reply-in-inbox-by-gmail&quot;&gt;“Smart Reply”&lt;/a&gt;—which later made their way into Gmail, especially with the latter’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/40563009/heres-whats-new-in-gmails-big-productivity-boosting-update&quot;&gt;sweeping new upgrade&lt;/a&gt;. So much of Inbox has rubbed off on Gmail, in fact, that it shouldn’t come as a complete shock that Google has decided that Inbox has served its purpose. The company is announcing today that it’s decided to discontinue the app, which will fade away by the end of next March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90235701/the-new-apple-watch-4-face-is-a-design-crime&quot;&gt;Related: The new Apple Watch 4 face is a design crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never got addicted to Inbox myself, but am still saddened by its demise. It arrived during an era of refreshing email invention that had been kicked off by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/3028905/dropbox-now-has-275-million-users&quot;&gt;a slick, streamlined app called Mailbox&lt;/a&gt;; Inbox seemed like a side bet on Google’s part just in case the new contenders seriously threatened Gmail’s turf. Mailbox itself ended up being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/7/9862470/dropbox-shutting-down-mailbox-carousel-apps&quot;&gt;discontinued&lt;/a&gt; by Dropbox, which had acquired it, back in 2015. Gmail, meanwhile, just keeps rolling along. With that in mind, I can see why Google might consider Inbox to be a bit superfluous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m also sure that Inbox enthusiasts—some of whom used the app precisely because it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/40448852/hey-gmail-fans-heres-the-easy-way-to-switch-to-inbox-googles-most-productive-email&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;wasn’t&lt;/em&gt; Gmail&lt;/a&gt;—will take the news hard, even if Inbox’s influence on the current Gmail has been profound. (In April, my colleague Jesus Diaz bristled at the density of the new Inbox-inspired Gmail interface and advised people to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90169668/if-you-hate-the-new-gmail-heres-a-much-better-alternative&quot;&gt;abandon it for Inbox itself&lt;/a&gt;.) And I can’t help but wonder: By retiring Inbox, is Google losing a valuable ability to experiment with new email functionality in a way that’s tough to do with a billion-user mainstay? (Gmail will retain a setting that lets you turn on experimental features not otherwise available in the app.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Brave files adtech complaint against Google</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-privacy-complaint/mozilla-co-founders-brave-files-adtech-complaint-against-google-idUSKCN1LS2JL</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-privacy-complaint/mozilla-co-founders-brave-files-adtech-complaint-against-google-idUSKCN1LS2JL</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;COLOGNE, Germany (Reuters) - Brave, a privacy-focused web browser set up by Silicon Valley engineering guru Brendan Eich, filed privacy complaints in Britain and Ireland that could become a test case against search company Google and other digital advertising firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The petitioners say they want to trigger an article in the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requiring an EU-wide investigation, making it a test case for a new European Data Protection Board created to give the privacy regime more teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GDPR seeks to ensure that individuals have greater control over the data that companies hold about them. Brave and the co-plaintiffs say Google and others are playing fast and loose with people’s data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a massive and systematic data breach at the heart of the behavioral advertising industry. Despite the two-year lead-in period before the GDPR, adtech companies have failed to comply,” Brave’s chief policy officer Johnny Ryan told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint argues that when a person visits a website, intimate personal data that describe them and what they are doing online is broadcast to tens or hundreds of companies without their knowledge in order to auction and place ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, it says in the complaints filed on Wednesday, violates the GDPR’s requirement for personal data to be processed in a way that ensures they are properly secured, including against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google says it is has already implemented strong privacy protections in consultation with European regulators and is committed to complying with the GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brave operates as a private browser and ad blocker, preventing the use of trackers on web pages to harvest data about people’s online behavior - giving it detailed insight into the inner workings of the online ad industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brave &lt;a href=&quot;https://brave.com&quot;&gt;brave.com&lt;/a&gt;'s co-founder Eich is best known as the creator of the Javascript web programming language and was also a co-founder of Mozilla, the open-source web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new data privacy law could also have a huge impact on the small army of tech firms that comes between giants like Google and its users to harvest and crunch data from websites to form very specific consumer profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;HEAVY FINES&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were the regulator to find in favor of the plaintiffs, that could undermine the foundations of the data-driven model on with the online ad industry - forecast by research firm eMarketer to grow to $273 billion this year - depends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GDPR is the first data privacy regime that foresees heavy fines for serious violations - of up to 4 percent of a company’s global turnover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filing, on behalf of Ryan, Jim Killock of the Open Rights Group, a non-profit organization, and academic Michael Veale of University College London, coincided with the opening of a major digital marketing fair in Cologne, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A copy of the complaint seen by Reuters argues that Google and the adtech industry commit “wide-scale and systematic breaches of the data protection regime” through the way they place personalized online ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happens through a process called “real-time bidding” and does so through two main channels. One, called OpenRTB, is used by most players in the industry, while a second, called Authorised Buyers, is run by Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint argues that these gather and broadcast more personal data than could be justified for advertising purposes; that this data is then subject to further unauthorized processing; and that it can include sensitive information such as sexuality, ethnicity or political opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ravi Naik, a partner at ITN Solicitors in London who is representing the plaintiffs, said this case addressed a long-standing data-protection concern that “is likely to have far reaching and dramatic consequences, which may change our fundamental relationship with the Internet”.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Apple can delete purchased movies from your library without telling you</title>
<link>https://theoutline.com/post/6167/apple-can-delete-the-movies-you-purchased-without-telling-you</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://theoutline.com/post/6167/apple-can-delete-the-movies-you-purchased-without-telling-you</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;When you buy a movie on iTunes, it’s yours forever, until such a time as when Apple maybe loses the rights to distribute it, and then it will disappear from your library without a trace. This is what happened to Anders G. da Silva, who goes by @drandersgs on Twitter, and who &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/drandersgs/status/1039270646243414016&quot;&gt;tweeted about&lt;/a&gt; losing three movies bought on the iTunes Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When da Silva wrote to Apple to complain about the missing movies, Apple wrote back to him that “the content provider has removed these movies from the Canadian Store. Hence, these movies are not available in the Canada iTunes Store at this time.” For his trouble in notifying Apple that it had disappeared three of his ostensible belongings for incredibly dubious legal reasons, Apple offered da Silva not even a refund, but two credits for renting a movie on the iTunes Store “priced up to $5.99 USD.” After he argued that he was not in the market for rentals and would just like the movies he purchased, please, Apple tried to appease him with two more rental credits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be completely fair, the iTunes Store’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html&quot;&gt;Terms of Service&lt;/a&gt;, which surely no one has ever read, do address this kind of incident. Years ago, Apple began offering “cloud storage” for content purchased from its store, meaning that if a user deleted the content from any device, it could be re-downloaded to that same device, or a different authorized device, later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;7.5323076923077&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Me: Hey Apple, three movies I bought disappeared from my iTunes library.&lt;br/&gt;Apple: Oh yes, those are not available anymore. Thank you for buying them. Here are two movie rentals on us!&lt;br/&gt;Me: Wait... WHAT?? &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tim_cook?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@tim_cook&lt;/a&gt; when did this become acceptable? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/dHJ0wMSQH9&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/dHJ0wMSQH9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Anders G da Silva (@drandersgs) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/drandersgs/status/1039270646243414016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 10, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;7.311004784689&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Me: I see... So, that &quot;Buy&quot; button is meaningless? It should maybe be called: &quot;Feelin Lucky?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple: I see you are unhappy. Have two more rentals on us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3/7&lt;/p&gt;
— Anders G da Silva (@drandersgs) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/drandersgs/status/1039606415306833920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 11, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You may be able to redownload previously acquired Content (‘Redownload’) to your devices that are signed in with the same Apple ID (‘Associated Devices’),” says the TOS, but also, “Content may not be available for Redownload if that Content is no longer offered on our Services.” For reasons that are easy to guess, Apple has never widely advertised that, by deleting locally stored content, users are actually rolling the dice as to whether they will ever be able to get it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time tech overlords have made digital content rights inconsistent with any person’s normal understanding of what a “purchase” is. Back in 2009, Amazon customers noticed that their copies of &lt;em&gt;1984&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Animal Farm&lt;/em&gt; by George Orwell &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/18/technology/companies/18amazon.html&quot;&gt;were suddenly missing&lt;/a&gt;. It turned out the copies were created by a seller that did not have the rights to the books, and when Amazon found this out, it pulled the books directly off of all the Kindles that had downloaded them. Later, the company acknowledged this was maybe not the best course of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, Amazon decided to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/technolog/you-dont-own-your-kindle-books-amazon-reminds-customer-1C6626211&quot;&gt;terminate the account&lt;/a&gt; of another user who then lost access to 43 Kindle books she had purchased. When she protested, Amazon’s UK arm chided her, “Amazon.co.uk and its affiliates reserve the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit content, or cancel orders at their sole discretion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As da Silva and others have pointed out before, the “Buy” button in digital stores is, at best, mislabeled. You cannot truly buy any digital thing online; you can only rent it, and any online video store is little more than an expensive, glorified, extremely convenient Blockbuster. In conclusion, let’s go back to DVDs. We have requested comment from Apple and will update if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook open-sources LogDevice, a distributed storage for sequential data</title>
<link>https://logdevice.io/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://logdevice.io/</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Designed from the ground up for data logging of all types.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;LogDevice is designed from the ground up to serve many types of logs with high reliability and efficiency at scale. It is also highly tunable allowing each use case to be optimized for the right set of trade-offs in the durability-efficiency and consistency-availability space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;LogDevice is heavily used for high-durability low-latency streaming use cases as well as high-throughput machine-learning pipelines. The customizability that LogDevice offers makes it a versatile building block in many situations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

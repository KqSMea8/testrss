GENERAL NOTES
=============

A short summary of the file layout:

code/                                   Quake III Arena source code ( renderer, game code, OS layer etc. )
code/bspc                               bot routes compiler source code
lcc/                                    the retargetable C compiler ( produces assembly to be turned into qvm bytecode by q3asm )
q3asm/                                  assembly to qvm bytecode compiler
q3map/                                  map compiler ( .map -&amp;gt; .bsp ) - this is the version that comes with Q3Radiant 200f
q3radiant/                              Q3Radiant map editor build 200f ( common/ and libs/ are support dirs for radiant )

While we made sure we were still able to compile the game on Windows, GNU/Linux and Mac, this build didn't get any kind of extensive testing so it may not work completely right. Whenever an id game is released under GPL, several projects start making the source code more friendly to nowaday's compilers and environements. If you are picking up this release weeks/months/years after we uploaded it, you probably want to look around on the net for cleaned up versions of this codebase as well.

COMPILING ON WIN32
==================

VC7 / Visual C++ 2003 project files are provided:
code/quake3.sln
q3radiant/Radiant.sln

To compile the qvms, you need to run some batch files:
you will need to have lcc.exe q3cpp.exe q3rcc.exe and q3asm.exe in your path
( some precompiled binaries are provided in lcc/bin and code/win32/mod-sdk-setup/bin )
the qvm batch files are in code/game code/cgame code/q3_ui code/ui ..

COMPILING ON GNU/LINUX
==================

the build system using cons, which may be known as scons's perl ancestor now
you don't have to track it down though, the build script is provided in the tree
you will need nasm and gcc 2.95
make sure you have the X Direct Graphics Access and X Video Mode extensions headers for your X11
a typical compile command goes like this:
[..]/code$ ./unix/cons -- gcc=gcc-2.95 g++=g++-2.95

COMPILING ON MAC
================

project file for OSX compile is in code/macosx/Quake3.pbproj
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Russia Bans 1.8M Amazon and Google IPs in Attempt to Block Telegram</title>
<link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/government/russia-bans-18-million-amazon-and-google-ips-in-attempt-to-block-telegram/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/government/russia-bans-18-million-amazon-and-google-ips-in-attempt-to-block-telegram/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Russian flag&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2016/12/08/Russian-Flag.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1250&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roskomnadzor, Russia's telecommunications watchdog, banned today over 1.8 million IP addresses belonging to Amazon and Google's cloud infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following IP blocks have been reported as banned in Russia at the ISP level. The IP ranges account for 1,835,008 IPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;52.58.0.0/15
18.196.0.0/15
18.194.0.0/15
18.184.0.0/15
35.156.0.0/14
35.192.0.0/12&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;Inline update:&lt;/strong&gt; Te number of blocked IPs has now reached &lt;a href=&quot;https://2018.schors.spb.ru/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;over 16 million&lt;/a&gt;. New domains and IP ranges have been added today, April 17, to Russia's national blocklist. Newly banned domains and IPs can be tracked via &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zapret-info/z-i/commits&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;. We will not be keeping the above list up-to-date. Please refer to the GitHub repo instead.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move to ban these IP blocks is a response to Telegram moving some of its infrastructure to Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud servers over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roskomnadzor banned the Telegram instant messaging client inside Russia's border on Friday, April 13, after Telegram refused to hand over customers' encryption keys to the FSB, Russia's main intelligence service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By moving servers to Amazon and Google servers, Telegram was able to skirt the initial ban and provide service to Russian users over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many users ridiculed Roskomnadzor's decision on social media, and for good reasons, as the move to mass-ban so many IP addresses had secondary repercussions, as it also blocked many legitimate web services. Users reported many online games, mobile apps, and cryptocurrency services going dark over the course of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;9.3150289017341&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Telegram started using Amazon's AWS to bypass Russian censorship. Now, if you were &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/roscomnadzor?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;@roscomnadzor&lt;/a&gt; (highly unlikely because nobody's as dumb as these doorknobs), what would you do? Certainly not block 655352 IP addresses belonging to Amazon, right? That would be so stupid... oh &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/AxEHfRUGnU&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/AxEHfRUGnU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;7.6553846153846&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;So our blessed government blocked a bunch of Amazon IP addresses because they were used to circumvent the block on the Telegram messaging app. As a result, a whole bunch of MMOs and other multiplayer games using Amazon IPs stopped working. Idiocy still reigns supreme.&lt;/p&gt;
— The Old Man From Scene 24 (@Ariurotl) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Ariurotl/status/986005716715552768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;April 16, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;They've already blocked 2 millions of Amazon IPs, 1 million Google IPs and this is not the end. But the most funny in this mess that Telegram is still working without using VPN or Proxy...&lt;/p&gt;
— MashaSG (@MashaSnG) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MashaSnG/status/985992291226738688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;April 16, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;And these addresses include a lot of Amazon and Google services that sustain work of thousands of sites and other services that have nothing to do with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/telegram?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;@telegram&lt;/a&gt;. How far our dumb-ass idiots in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/roskomnadzor_rf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;@roskomnadzor_rf&lt;/a&gt; can go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;So, Telegram is officially banned in Russia now. To enforce this ban our government blocked over 2 million ip addresses today, mainly from Amazon AWS and Google subnets.&lt;br/&gt;What a time to be alive.&lt;/p&gt;
— Rannor Medved (@rannor_ru) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rannor_ru/status/985951150527647745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;April 16, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Apparently Russian communication governing body is run by retards because in a bid to block Telegram they've just fucking blocked half a million Amazon IP addresses and fucking crippled two major cellular carriers in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Whois public database is in breach of GDPR, according to European authorities</title>
<link>https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/04/14/whois_icann_gdpr_europe/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/04/14/whois_icann_gdpr_europe/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Whois public database of domain name registration details is dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/correspondence/jelinek-to-marby-11apr18-en.pdf&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; [PDF] sent this week to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/what-2012-02-25-en&quot;&gt;DNS overseer ICANN&lt;/a&gt;, Europe's data protection authorities have effectively killed off the current service, noting that it breaks the law and so will be illegal come 25 May, when GDPR comes into force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter also has harsh words for ICANN's proposed interim solution, criticizing its vagueness and noting it needs to include explicit wording about what can be done with registrant data, as well as introduce auditing and compliance functions to make sure the data isn't being abused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICANN now has a little over a month to come up with a replacement to the decades-old service that covers millions of domain names and lists the personal contact details of domain registrants, including their name, email and telephone number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;promo_article&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2018/04/10/embarrassed.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1&quot; width=&quot;174&quot; height=&quot;115&quot; alt=&quot;embarrassed&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 title=&quot;Internet registries and registrars provide terrible timeline&quot;&gt;Hey, so Europe's GDPR privacy deadline for Whois? We're going to miss it ... by a year or so&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/04/10/gdpr_whois_regulations/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;READ MORE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICANN has already acknowledged it has &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/04/10/gdpr_whois_regulations/&quot;&gt;no chance&lt;/a&gt; of doing so: a &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2018-04-12-en&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; by the company in response to the letter warns that without being granted a special temporary exemption from the law, the system will fracture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Unless there is a moratorium, we may no longer be able to give instructions to the contracted parties through our agreements to maintain Whois,&quot; it warns. &quot;Without resolution of these issues, the Whois system will become fragmented.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spoke with the president of ICANN's Global Domains Division, Akram Atallah, and he told us that while there was &quot;general agreement that having every thing public is not the right way to go&quot;, he was hopeful that the letter would not result in the Whois service being turned off completely while a replacement was developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;crosshead&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Justify my love&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think the Working Party is looking at this issue from a 'do you have the right justification?' perspective,&quot; he argued. &quot;So we need to dig into the justifications in terms of our bylaws and mission and remit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the Whois service may still publish some personal details once everything has been worked through, so long as there is a clear justification for it. It's uncertain at this stage what that would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Atallah's current focus is on persuading the authorities to grant ICANN a stay of execution while it comes up with an interim model. &quot;It is very important for us to have a moratorium and be able to say to our contracted parties 'if you implement this model, you will be in full compliance',&quot; he noted. &quot;We need some kind of relief.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was however unable to give an example of another industry that has been granted similar relief, relying on public statements from data protection authorities that they aren't seeking to punish people but want to work with organizations to improve privacy, as an argument for why ICANN should be exempted for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics point out that ICANN has largely brought these problems on itself, having ignored official warnings from the Article 29 Working Party for nearly a decade, and only taking the GDPR requirements seriously six months ago when there has been a clear two-year lead time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One company that is caught in the middle of the dispute is sanguine about the possible death of the service. &quot;Is this the end of public Whois? Yes, in its current form,&quot; CEO of Irish registrar Blacknight, Michele Neylon told us. &quot;But is it going to go completely dark? No.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neylon has long complained about ICANN's refusal to acknowledge European law when it comes to the Whois service: back in 2013, he refused to sign an updated version of the contract that domain name sellers have with ICANN until it gave him a legal waiver over its data retention requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;That decision probably cost us money, but if we have to choose between operating legally or illegally our path is clear,&quot; he wrote in a &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://blacknight.blog/game-over-for-public-whois-article-29-gives-icann-the-advice-it-asked-for.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; this week.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Text Embedding Models Contain Bias. Here's Why That Matters.</og:title>
<og:image>http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fWEPzhrhdqk/WKbYSrN1_8I/AAAAAAAATXE/m2-ZgsirkMYKc_YhcehEb0iUdyGtLs8KACK4B/s1600/lockup_google_developers_horizontal_knockout_wht.png</og:image>
<og:description>Human data encodes human biases by default. Being aware of this is a good start, and the conversation around how to handle it is ongoing. At Google, we are actively researching unintended bias analysis and mitigation strategies because we are committed to making products that work well for everyone. In this post, we'll examine a few text embedding models, suggest some tools for evaluating certain forms of bias, and discuss how these issues matter when building applications.</og:description>

<title>Microsoft built its own custom Linux kernel for its new IoT service</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/16/microsoft-built-its-own-custom-linux-kernel-for-its-new-iot-service/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/16/microsoft-built-its-own-custom-linux-kernel-for-its-new-iot-service/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;At a small press event in San Francisco, &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;microsoft&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; today &lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-microsoft-azure-sphere-secure-and-power-the-intelligent-edge/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the launch of a secure end-to-end IoT product that focuses on microcontroller-based devices — the kind of devices that use tiny and relatively low-powered microcontrollers (MCUs) for basic control or connectivity features. Typically, these kinds of devices, which could be anything from a toy to a household gadget or an industrial application, don’t often get updated and hence, security often suffers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-sphere/&quot;&gt;Azure Sphere&lt;/a&gt; is a new class of certified MCUs. As Microsoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith stressed in today’s announcement, Microsoft will license these new Azure Sphere chips for free, in hopes to jump-start the Azure Sphere ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it’s hard to secure a device you can’t update or get telemetry from, it’s no surprise that these devices will feature built-in connectivity. And with that connectivity, these devices can also connect to the Azure Sphere Security Service in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/lki7HOOkFjU?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you probably assume that these devices will run Windows, but you’re wrong. For the first time ever, Microsoft is launching a custom Linux kernel and distribution: the Azure Sphere OS. It’s an update to the kind of real-time operating systems that today’s MCUs often use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why use Linux? “With Azure Sphere, Microsoft is addressing an entirely new class of IoT devices, the MCU,” Rob Lefferts, Microsoft’s partner director for Windows enterprise and security told me at the event.” Windows IoT runs on microprocessor units (MPUs) which have at least 100x the power of the MCU. The Microsoft-secured Linux kernel used in the Azure Sphere IoT OS is shared under an OSS license so that silicon partners can rapidly enable new silicon innovations.” And those partners are also very comfortable with taking an open-source release and integrating that with their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the process started, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediatek.com/news-events/press-releases/mediatek-collaborates-with-microsoft-to-advance-innovation-and-security-for-the-intelligent-edge&quot;&gt;MediaTek&lt;/a&gt; is producing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediatek.com/products/azureSphere/mt3620&quot;&gt;the first set&lt;/a&gt; of these new MCUs. These are low-powered, single-core ARM-A7 systems that run at 500MHz and include WiFi connectivity as well as a number of other I/O options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as the open ecosystem goes, Smith also stressed that the devices can be used with services that run on any other cloud, no matter whether that’s AWS or the Alibaba Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Amazon’s AWS unit announced a somewhat similar project at &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/29/amazon-freertos-is-a-new-operating-system-for-microcontroller-based-iot-devices/&quot;&gt;its re:Invent conference last year&lt;/a&gt;. It’s probably no surprise that these large cloud providers are interested in MCUs, given that while the devices themselves are not bound to any cloud, the only way to get the full value out of them is in combination with cloud services, whether that’s for authenticating new devices, updating operating systems or managing the software that runs on them.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Teenager facing prison for downloading unsecured files from government website</title>
<link>http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/freedom-of-information-request-privacy-breach-teen-speaks-out-1.4621970</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/freedom-of-information-request-privacy-breach-teen-speaks-out-1.4621970</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The 19-year-old facing a criminal charge for downloading files from Nova Scotia's freedom-of-information portal sits in a sofa in his parent's living room in Halifax.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;His bedroom is upstairs. That's where police found him sleeping when 15 officers raided the family home last Wednesday morning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;His demeanour is polite, almost meek. When he speaks, his voice is quiet. He could easily pass for younger than 19.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Computers have been a part of me for a very long time,&quot; he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The teen has been charged with &quot;unauthorized use of a computer,&quot; which carries a possible 10-year prison sentence, for downloading approximately 7,000 freedom-of-information releases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;64.03&quot; class=&quot;imageEl storyImage loaded lazyImage smallImage&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.4619266.1523654694!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/ns-infrastructure-funding-20180410.jpg?imwidth=100&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;On Friday, Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil said the person who downloaded the documents 'stole' the information. (Canadian Press)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of these files were already publicly available, and had been redacted prior to release to remove any personal information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But about 250 of the reports were prepared for Nova Scotians requesting their own government files. These un-redacted records contained sensitive personal information, and were never intended for public release.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has faced continued questions since it announced the privacy breach last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, the premier accused the teenager of &quot;stealing&quot; the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in an interview with CBC News, the 19-year-old says he thought he was downloading an archive of public information that was supposed to be freely available on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anonymity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teenager has not been formally arraigned on the single charge, so his name is not yet public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the family's request, CBC News is granting him anonymity because of his hope the charge will be dropped and his reputation preserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don't know if I'll be able to get a job if this gets on my record.… I don't know what my future will be like,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Early talent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the teenager's earliest memories involve playing with MS Paint on the family computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he was around eight, he remembered playing around with the HTML of the Google search page, making the coloured letters spell out his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;6.5193370165746&quot;&gt;Around the same time, his Grade 3 class adopted an animal at a shelter, receiving an electronic adoption certificate.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That led to a discovery on the classroom computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The website had a number at the end, and I was able to change the last digit of the number to a different number and was able to see a certificate for someone else's animal that they adopted,&quot; he said. &quot;I thought that was interesting.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Researching teachers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teenager's current troubles arose because he used the same trick on Nova Scotia's freedom-of-information portal, downloading about 7,000 freedom-of-information requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says his interest stemmed from the government's recent labour troubles with teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I wanted more transparency on the teachers' dispute,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few searches for teacher-related releases on the provincial freedom-of-information portal, he didn't find what he was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;A lot of them were just simple questions that people were asking. Like some were information about Syrian refugees. Others were about student grades and stuff like that,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;56.29&quot; class=&quot;imageEl storyImage loaded lazyImage smallImage&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.3521317.1459867899!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/computer-code.jpg?imwidth=100&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;The teen said a single line of code was all it took to get the information. (CBC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead, he decided to download all the files to search later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I decided these are all transparency documents that the government is displaying. I decided to download all of them just to save,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says it took a single line of code and a few hours of computer time to copy 7,000 freedom-of-information requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I didn't do anything to try to hide myself. I didn't think any of this would be wrong if it's all public information. Since it was public, I thought it was free to just download, to save,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Passion for archiving&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn't the first website the 19-year-old had saved for general interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He estimates he has around 30 terabytes of online data on hard drives in his home, the equivalent of &quot;millions&quot; of web pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;5.4&quot;&gt;He usually copies online forums such as 4chan and Reddit, where posts are either quickly erased or can become difficult to locate.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I preserve things, I archive the internet. I have history on my computer, and all of that should be saved and preserved,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His mother vouches for her son's passion for organizing, even cataloguing his late grandfather's VHS collection of home video and recordings off the television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don't think he did anything wrong. He's a good boy and he saved stuff.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Police raid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family was going through its morning routine last Wednesday when the police banged on the front door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mother says she, her husband, and two of her kids were corralled in the living room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They read us our rights and told us not to talk,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our daughter, she was really traumatized, really bad — brought her to tears, the way they conducted this,&quot; said the father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She says at one point there were 15 officers in the home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;People were going into the kitchen, were going into the dining room, going upstairs. They went into the basement. They were [traipsing] through the house, everywhere,&quot; the mother said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;56.29&quot; class=&quot;imageEl storyImage loaded lazyImage smallImage&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.4615046.1523475512!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/supt-jim-perrin-said-police-rarely-charge-people-with-unauthorized-use-of-a-computer.jpg?imwidth=100&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;Supt. Jim Perrin said last week police rarely charge people with unauthorized use of a computer, but that it was the right offence in this case. (CBC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She says the family is still working through the mess they left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They rifled through everything. They turned over mattresses, they took drawers and emptied out drawers, they went through personal papers, pictures,&quot; she said. &quot;It was totally devastating and traumatic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She says police seized her son's computers, plus her husband's cellphone and work computers, which has left him unable to do his job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also seized her younger son's desktop computer, after he was arrested on the street walking to high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officers took her 13-year-old daughter to question her in a police car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My little ones are asking, 'Will I be able to get a job because we were arrested?'&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 19-year-old accused says he's been passing his time watching TV and doing paper crosswords because he's not allowed to access the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's worried he'll lose his academic year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I've been feeling kind of sick the whole past week. Haven't been eating much. Haven't been doing much at all,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;3.4041095890411&quot;&gt;He says this is his first time he's ever been in this kind of trouble.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have never been in the legal system ever in my life.… This is the first time for me. All this is first, and it's all new, and I don't know what to do.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teenager says since he was downloading public records off a public website, it all feels unfair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I just had no malicious intent and I shouldn't be charged for this,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What Data Does Facebook Collect When I’m Not Using Facebook, and Why?</title>
<link>https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/data-off-facebook/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/data-off-facebook/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Hard Questions is &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/06/hard-questions/&quot;&gt;a series&lt;/a&gt; from Facebook that addresses the impact of our products on society.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/david.baser&quot;&gt;David Baser&lt;/a&gt;, Product Management Director&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Mark Zuckerberg testified in front of the US Congress. He answered more than 500 questions and promised that we would get back on the 40 or so questions he couldn’t answer at the time. We’re following up with Congress on these directly but we also wanted to take the opportunity to explain more about the information we get from other websites and apps, how we use the data they send to us, and the controls you have. I lead a team focused on privacy and data use, including GDPR compliance and the tools people can use to control and download their information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When does Facebook get data about people from other websites and apps?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many websites and apps use Facebook services to make their content and ads more engaging and relevant. These services include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social plugins&lt;/em&gt;, such as our Like and Share buttons, which make other sites more social and help you share content on Facebook;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook Login,&lt;/em&gt; which lets you use your Facebook account to log into another website or app;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook Analytic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;, which helps websites and apps better understand how people use their services; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook ads and measurement tools,&lt;/em&gt; which enable websites and apps to show ads from Facebook advertisers, to run their own ads on Facebook or elsewhere, and to understand the effectiveness of their ads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you visit a site or app that uses our services, we receive information even if you’re logged out or don’t have a Facebook account. This is because other apps and sites don’t know who is using Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many companies offer these types of services and, like Facebook, they also get information from the apps and sites that use them. Twitter, Pinterest and LinkedIn all have similar Like and Share buttons to help people share things on their services. Google has a popular analytics service. And Amazon, Google and Twitter all offer login features. These companies — and many others — also offer advertising services. In fact, most websites and apps send the same information to multiple companies each time you visit them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kind of data does Facebook get from these websites and apps?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apps and websites that use our services, such as the Like button or Facebook Analytics, send us information to make their content and ads better. To understand more about how this happens, it helps to know how most websites and apps work. I’ll use websites as an example, but this generally applies to apps, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you visit a website, your browser (for example Chrome, Safari or Firefox) sends a request to the site’s server. The browser shares your IP address so the website knows where on the internet to send the site content. The website also gets information about the browser and operating system (for example Android or Windows) you’re using because not all browsers and devices support the same features. It also gets cookies, which are identifiers that websites use to know if you’ve visited before. This can help with things like saving items in your shopping cart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A website typically sends two things back to your browser: first, content from that site; and second, instructions for the browser to send your request to the other companies providing content or services on the site. So when a website uses one of our services, your browser sends the same kinds of information to Facebook as the website receives. We also get information about which website or app you’re using, which is necessary to know when to provide our tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happens for any other service the site is using. For example, when you see a YouTube video on a site that’s not YouTube, it tells your browser to request the video from YouTube. YouTube then sends it to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does Facebook use the data it receives from other websites and apps?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/policy.php&quot;&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; explains in detail what we do with the information we receive — and we just &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/terms-and-data-policy/&quot;&gt;updated&lt;/a&gt; the policy to make it easier to read. There are three main ways in which Facebook uses the information we get from other websites and apps: providing our services to these sites or apps; improving safety and security on Facebook; and enhancing our own products and services. I’ll share a little more about each of these, but first I want to be clear: We don’t sell people’s data. Period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Providing Our Services&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social plugins and Facebook Login&lt;/em&gt;. We use your IP address, browser/operating system information, and the address of the website or app you’re using to make these features work. For example, knowing your IP address allows us to send the Like button to your browser and helps us show it in your language. Cookies and device identifiers help us determine whether you’re logged in, which makes it easier to share content or use Facebook to log into another app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook Analytics.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://analytics.facebook.com&quot;&gt;Facebook Analytics&lt;/a&gt; gives websites and apps data about how they are used. IP addresses help us list the countries where people are using an app. Browser and operating system information enable us to give developers information about the platforms people use to access their app. Cookies and other identifiers help us count the number of unique visitors. Cookies also help us recognize which visitors are Facebook users so we can provide aggregated demographic information, like age and gender, about the people using the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ads&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/business/products/audience-network&quot;&gt;Facebook Audience Network&lt;/a&gt; enables other websites and apps to show ads from Facebook advertisers. When we get a request to show an Audience Network ad, we need to know where to send it and the browser and operating system a person is using. Cookies and device identifiers help us determine whether the person uses Facebook. If they don’t, we can show an ad encouraging them to sign up for Facebook. If they do, we’ll show them ads from the same advertisers that are targeting them on Facebook. We can also use the fact that they visited a site or app to show them an ad from that business – or a similar one – back on Facebook. &lt;em&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Updated April 16, 2018 at 5:30PM&lt;/strong&gt; to clarify that people with Facebook accounts will see Audience Network ads from the same advertisers targeting them on Facebook.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ad Measurement&lt;/em&gt;. An advertiser can choose to add the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-ads-pixel&quot;&gt;Facebook Pixel&lt;/a&gt;, some computer code, to their site. This allows us to give advertisers stats about how many people are responding to their ads — even if they saw the ad on a different device — without us sharing anyone’s personal information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Keeping Your Information Secure&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also use the information we receive from websites and apps to help protect the security of Facebook. For example, receiving data about the sites a particular browser has visited can help us identify bad actors. If someone tries to log into your account using an IP address from a different country, we might ask some questions to verify it’s you. Or if a browser has visited hundreds of sites in the last five minutes, that’s a sign the device might be a bot. We’ll ask them to prove they’re a real person by completing additional security checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Improving Our Products and Services&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information we receive also helps us improve the content and ads we show on Facebook. So if you visit a lot of sports sites that use our services, you might see sports-related stories higher up in your News Feed. If you’ve looked at travel sites, we can show you ads for hotels and rental cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What controls do I have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Mark said last week, we believe everyone deserves good privacy controls. We require websites and apps who use our tools to tell you they’re collecting and sharing your information with us, and to get your permission to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give you a number of controls over the way this data is used to provide more relevant content and ads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.com/help/371675846332829&quot;&gt;News Feed preferences&lt;/a&gt; lets you choose which content you see first and hide content you don’t want to see in your feed. You can also view your News Feed &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.com/help/218728138156311&quot;&gt;chronologically&lt;/a&gt; instead of ranked by what Facebook predicts you might be most interested in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.com/ads/preferences&quot;&gt;Ad preferences&lt;/a&gt; shows you the advertisers whose ads you might be seeing because you visited their sites or apps. You can remove any of these advertisers to stop seeing their ads.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In addition, you can opt out of these types of ads entirely — so you never see ads on Facebook based on information we have received from other websites and apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, if you don’t want us to use your Facebook interests to show you ads on other websites and apps, there’s a control for that too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s information from apps and websites, or information you share with other people on Facebook, we want to put you in control — and be transparent about what information Facebook has and how it is used. We’ll keep working to make that easier.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Distributed architecture concepts I learned when building a large payment system</title>
<link>http://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/distributed-architecture-concepts-i-have-learned-while-building-payments-systems/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/distributed-architecture-concepts-i-have-learned-while-building-payments-systems/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I joined Uber two years ago as a mobile software engineer with some backend experience. I ended up building the payments functionality in the app - and &lt;a href=&quot;https://eng.uber.com/new-rider-app/&quot;&gt;rewriting the app&lt;/a&gt; on the way. Afterwards, I ended up &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/things-ive-learned-transitioning-from-engineer-to-engineering-manager/&quot;&gt;moving into engineering management&lt;/a&gt;, heading up the team itself. This meant getting exposed to more backend, as my team is responsible for many of the backend systems that enable payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before working at Uber, I had little to no distributed systems experience.&lt;/strong&gt; My background is a traditional computer science degree and a decade of full stack software development. However, while I was able to draw boxes and talk tradeoffs, I did not have much understanding or appreciation of distributed concepts like consistency, availability or idempotency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I am summarizing some of the concepts that I have found essential to learn and apply when building a large scale, highly available and distributed system: the payments system that powers Uber. This is a system with a load of up to thousands of requests per second, where critical payments functionality needs to work correctly, even if parts of the system are down. Is this a complete list? Probably not. But it's the stuff that would have made my life easier, had I known them earlier. So let's dive into things like SLAs, consistency, data durability, message persistence, idempotency and some other things I needed to learn on the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sla&quot;&gt;SLA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With large systems, that process millions of events per day, some things are bound to go wrong. Before diving into planning a system, I have found the most important thing to decide what a system that is &quot;healthy&quot; means. &quot;Healthy&quot; should be something that is &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; measurable. The common way to measure &quot;healthy&quot; is with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement&quot;&gt;SLAs&lt;/a&gt;: service level agreements. Some of the most common SLAs I have seen used are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Availability&lt;/strong&gt;: the percentage of the time the service is operational. While it is tempting to want to have a system that has 100% availability, achieving this can be really difficult, as well as expensive. Even large and critical systems like the VISA card network, Gmail or internet providers don't have 100% availability - over years, they will be down for seconds, minutes or hours. For many systems, the four nines availability (99.99%, or about &lt;a href=&quot;https://uptime.is/&quot;&gt;50 minutes downtime&lt;/a&gt; per year) is considered high availability. Just getting to this level is quite the work usually, to get to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accuracy&lt;/strong&gt;: is it ok for some of the data in the system to be inaccurate or lost? If so, what percentage is acceptable? For the payments sytems that I worked on, accuracy needed to be 100%, meaning no data was allowed to be lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capacity&lt;/strong&gt;: what expected load should the system be able to support? This is usually expressed in requests per second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Latency&lt;/strong&gt;: in what time should the system respond? What is the time that 95% of the requests and 99% of the requests should be served? Systems usually have a lot of noisy requests, hence the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-is-p99-latency&quot;&gt;p95 and p99 latencies&lt;/a&gt; are more practical usage in the real world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why did SLAs matter when building a large payments system?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We put together a new system, replacing an existing one. To make sure we build the right thing, a system that is &quot;better&quot; than it's successor, we used SLAs to define expectations. Availability was one of our top requirements. Once defining the target, we needed to consider the tradeoffs in the architecture to be able to meet this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;horizontalvsverticalscaling&quot;&gt;Horizontal vs vertical scaling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming the business using a newly built system grows, the load will only increase. At some point, the existing setup will not be able to support more load and more capacity needs to be added. The two most common scaling strategies are vertical or horizontal scaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horizontal scaling is about adding more machines (or nodes) to the system, to increase capacity. Horizontal scaling is the most popular way to scale distributed systems, especially, as adding (virtual) machines to a cluster is often as easy as a click of a button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vertical scaling is basically &quot;buying a bigger/stronger machine&quot; - either a (virtual) machine with more cores, more processing, more memory. With distributed systems, vertically scaling is usually less popular as it can be more costly than scaling horizontally. However, some major sites, like Stack Overflow has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/InfoQ/scaling-stack-overflow-keeping-it-vertical-by-obsessing-over-performance&quot;&gt;successfully scaled vertically&lt;/a&gt; to meet demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why did the scaling strategy matter when building a large payments system?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We decided early on that we would build a system that scales horizontally. While vertical scaling is possible in some cases, our payments system was already at the projected load that we were pessimistic if a single, super-expensive mainframe could even handle it today, not to mention in the future. We also had engineers on our team who have worked at large payment providers where they tried - and failed - to scale vertically on the largest machines that money could buy at their time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;consistency&quot;&gt;Consistency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Availability of any system is important. Distributed systems are often built on top of machines that have lower availability. Let's say our goal is to build a system with a 99.999% availability (being down about 5 minutes/year). We are using machines/nodes that have, on average, 99.9% availability (they are down about 8 hours/year). A straightforward way to get our availability number is to add a bunch of these machines/nodes into a cluster. Even if some of the nodes are down, others will be up and the overall availability of the system will be higher, than the availability of the individual components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistency is a key concern in highly available systems. A system is consistent if all nodes see and return the same data, at the same time. Going back to the previous model, where we added a bunch of nodes to achieve higher availability, ensuring that the system stays consistent is not so trivial. To make sure that each node has the same information, they need to send messages to each other, to keep themselves in sync. However, messages sent to each other can fail to deliver, they can get lost and some of the nodes might be unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistency is a concept that I spent the most time understanding and appreciating. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_model&quot;&gt;several consistency models&lt;/a&gt;, the most common one used in distributed systems being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/0910/ConcDistS/11a-cons-tx.pdf&quot;&gt;strong consistency, weak consistency&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://sergeiturukin.com/2017/06/29/eventual-consistency.html&quot;&gt;eventual consistency&lt;/a&gt;. The Hackernoon article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/eventual-vs-strong-consistency-in-distributed-databases-282fdad37cf7&quot;&gt;eventual vs strong consistency&lt;/a&gt; gives a nice and practical overview of what the tradeoffs between these models are. Typically, the weaker the consistency required, the faster the system can be, but the more likely it will return not the latest set of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why did consistency matter when building a large payments system?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Data in the system needed to be consistent. But just how consistent? For some parts of the system, only strongly consistent data would do. For example, knowing if a payment has been initiated is something that needed to be stored in a strongly consistent way. For other parts, that were less mission-critical, eventual consistency is something that was considered as a reasonable tradeoff. A good example is listing recent transactions: these could be implemented with eventual consistency (meaning, the latest transaction might only show up in parts of the system after a while - in return, the operation will be return with lower latency or be less resource intensive).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;datadurability&quot;&gt;Data Durability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durability_(database_systems)&quot;&gt;Durability&lt;/a&gt; means that once data is successfully added to a data store, it will be available going forward. This will be the case even if nodes in the system go offline, crash or have their data corrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different distributed databases have different levels of durability. Some support machine/node level durability, some do this at cluster level and some just don't provide it out of the box. Some form of replication is usually used to increase durability - if the data is stored on multiple nodes, if one or more nodes go down, the data will still be available. &lt;a href=&quot;https://drivescale.com/2017/03/whatever-happened-durability/&quot;&gt;Here is a good article&lt;/a&gt; on why achieving durability in distributed systems can be challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/content/images/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-14-at-10.14.21-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why did data durability matter when building a payments system?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; For many parts of the system, no data could be lost, given this being something critical, like payments. The distributed data stores we built on needed to support cluster level data durability - so even if instances would crash, completed transactions would persist. These days, most distributed data storage services, like Cassandra, MongoDB, HDFS or Dynamodb all support durability at various levels and can be all configured to provide cluster level durability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;messagepersistenceanddurability&quot;&gt;Message Persistence and Durability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nodes in distributed systems perform computations, store data and send messages to each other. A key characteristic of sending messages is how reliably these messages arrive. For mission-critical systems, there is often a need for having zero messages being lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For distributed systems, messaging is usually done by some distributed messaging service, such as RabbitMQ, Kafka or others. These messaging services can support (or be configured to support) different levels of reliability in delivering messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Message persistence means that when some failure happens on a node that is processing the message, the message will still be there to process after the failure is resolved. Message durability is usually used at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue&quot;&gt;message queue&lt;/a&gt; level. With a durable message queue, if the queue (or node) goes offline when the message is sent, it will still get the message when it comes back online. An good article to read more on this topic is &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2016/08/10/persistence-vs-durability-in-messaging/&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/content/images/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-14-at-10.29.13-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why did message persistence and durability matter when building a large payments system?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We had messages that could not be afforded to be lost, such as the message that a person has initiated payment for their ride. This meant that the messaging system that we used needed to be lossless: every message needed to be delivered once. However, building a system that delivers each message &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; once or one that delivers &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; once is different complexity. We decided to implement a durable messaging system with at least once delivery and chose a messaging bus, on top of which we would build this (we ended up going with Kafka, setting up a lossless cluster for this case).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;idempotency&quot;&gt;Idempotency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With distributed systems, things can go wrong, such as connections could drop midway or requests can time out. Clients will often retry these requests. An idempotent system ensures that no matter, how many times a specific request is executed, the actual execution on this request only happens once. A good example is making a payment. If a client makes a request to pay, the request is successful, but the client times out, the client could retry this same request. With an idempotent system, the person paying would not get charged twice. With a non-idempotent system, they could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing for idempotent, distributed systems require some sort of distributed locking strategy. This is where some of the earlier distributed system concepts come into play. Let's say we intend to implement idempotency by having optimistic locking in place, to avoid concurrent updates. In order to have optimistic locking, the system needs to be strongly consistent - so that at the time of the operation, we can check if another operation has been initiated, using some sort of versioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are numerous ways to achieve idempotency, depending on the constraints of the system and the type of operation. Designing idempotent approaches is a nice challenge - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bennadel.com/blog/3390-considering-strategies-for-idempotency-without-distributed-locking-with-ben-darfler.htm&quot;&gt;Ben Nadel writes about different strategies he has used&lt;/a&gt;, both with distributed locks or database constraints. When designing distributed systems, idempotency can be one of the easily overlooked parts. I have come across scenarios, where my team was burned by not ensuring correct idempotency for some key operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why did idempotency matter when building a large payments system?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Most importantly: to avoid double charges or double refunds. Given that our messaging system has at least once, lossless delivery, we need to assume that all messages might be delivered multiple times and systems need to ensure idempotency. We chose to handle this with versioning and optimistic locking, having the sytems that implement idempotent behaviour use a strongly consistent store as their data source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;shardingandquorum&quot;&gt;Sharding and Quorum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distributed systems often have to store a lot more data, than a single node can do so. So how does one go about storing a bunch of data on a certain number of machines? The most common technique is using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_(database_architecture)&quot;&gt;sharding&lt;/a&gt;. Data is horizontally partitioned using some sort of hash to assign to a partition. While many distributed databases implement sharding under the hood, sharding is an interesting area to learn more about, especially around &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@jeeyoungk/how-sharding-works-b4dec46b3f6&quot;&gt;resharding&lt;/a&gt;. Foursquare had a 17 hour downtime in 2010 due to hitting a sharding edge case, where a &lt;a href=&quot;http://highscalability.com/blog/2010/10/15/troubles-with-sharding-what-can-we-learn-from-the-foursquare.html&quot;&gt;nice postmortem was shared&lt;/a&gt; on the root causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many distributed systems have data or computations replicated across multiple nodes. In order to make sure that operations are performed in a consistent way, a voting based approach is defined, where a certain number of nodes needs to get the same result, for the operation to be successful. This is called the quorum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why did quorum and sharding matter when building the payments system at Uber?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Both of these are basic concepts that are pretty commonly used. I personally came across this concept when looking into how we setup Cassandra replication. Cassandra (and other distributed systems) &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.datastax.com/en/archived/cassandra/3.x/cassandra/dml/dmlConfigConsistency.html#dmlConfigConsistency__about-the-quorum-level&quot;&gt;use quorum&lt;/a&gt; and local quorum to ensure consistency across clusters. As a funny side effect, on some of our meetings, when enough people are in the room, someone would ask: &quot;Can we start? Do we have a quorum?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;theactormodel&quot;&gt;The Actor Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual vocabulary of describing programming practices - things like variables, interfaces, calling methods - all assume single machine systems. When talking about distributed systems, we need to use a different set of approach. A common way of describing these systems is following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model&quot;&gt;actor model&lt;/a&gt;, where we think about the code in terms of communication. This model is popular, as it matches the mental model that we would think of, for example, when describing how people communicate in an organization. Another, also popular way of describing distributed systems is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes&quot;&gt;CSP - communicating sequential processes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actor model is based on actors sending messages to each other and reacting to them. Each actor can do a limited set of things - create other actors, send messages to others or decide what to do with the next message. With a few simple rules, complex, distributed systems can be described well, which can also repair themselves, after an actor crashes. For a short overview, I recommend the article &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brianstorti.com/the-actor-model/&quot;&gt;The actor model in 10 minutes&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/brianstorti&quot;&gt;Brian Storti&lt;/a&gt;. Many languages have implemented &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model#Actor_libraries_and_frameworks&quot;&gt;actor libraries or frameworks&lt;/a&gt;. For example, at Uber, we use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4/intro/what-is-akka.html&quot;&gt;Akka toolkit&lt;/a&gt; for some of our systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why did the actor model matter when building a large payments system?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We were building a system with many engineers, a lot of them haivng distributed experience. We decided to follow a standard distributed model over coming up with distributed concepts ourselves, potentially reinventing the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;reactivearchitecture&quot;&gt;Reactive Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When building large, distributed systems, the goal is usually to make them resilient, elastic and scalable. May this be a payments system or another, high load systems, the patterns in doing this can be similar. People in the industry have been discovering and sharing best practices that work well in these cases - and Reactive Architecture is a popular and widely used pattern in this space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started with Reactive Architecture, I suggest reading the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/&quot;&gt;Reactive Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; and watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lightbend.com/blog/understand-reactive-architecture-design-and-programming-in-less-than-12-minutes&quot;&gt;this 12-minute video&lt;/a&gt; on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why did Reactive Architecture matter when building a large payments system?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://akka.io/&quot;&gt;Akka&lt;/a&gt;, the toolkit we used to build much of our new payments system was heavily influenced by reactive architecture. Many of our engineer's building this system were also familiar of reactive best practices. Following reactive principles - building a responsive, resilient, elastic and message-driven system, thus came quite naturally. Having a model to fall back on and check that progress is on the right track was something that I found helpful and I'll be using this model when building future systems as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;closing&quot;&gt;Closing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been lucky enough to participate in the re-building a high-scale, distributed, mission-critical system: the one powering payments at Uber. By working in this environment, I picked up a lot of distributed concepts that I did not have to use previously. I've summarized these in the hope that others find this helpful to start or continue learning about distributed systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This write-up has been strictly focused on the planning and architecting of these systems. There is a whole lot of things to be said about building, deploying and migrating between high-load systems as well as operating them reliably. But all those topics are other posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;l-article__dek o-small-container&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Nearly 80 years ago, a construction standstill derailed the subway’s progress, leading to its present crisis. This is the story, decade by decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-1&quot; readability=&quot;78&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In the first decades of the 20th century, New York City experienced an unprecedented infrastructure boom. Iconic bridges, opulent railway terminals, and much of what was then the world’s largest underground and rapid transit network were constructed in just 20 years. Indeed, that subway system grew from a single line in 1904 to a network hundreds of miles long by the 1920s. It spread rapidly into undeveloped land across upper Manhattan and the outer boroughs, bringing a wave of apartment houses alongside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Then it stopped. Since December 16, 1940, New York has not opened another new subway line, aside from a handful of small extensions and connections. Unlike most other great cities, New York’s rapid transit system remains frozen in time: Commuters on their iPhones are standing in stations scarcely changed from nearly 80 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Indeed, in some ways, things have moved backward. The network is actually considerably smaller than it was during the Second World War, and today’s six million daily riders are facing constant delays, infrastructure failures, and alarmingly crowded cars and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-2&quot; readability=&quot;53&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Why did New York abruptly stop building subways after the 1940s? And how did a construction standstill that started nearly 80 years ago lead to the present moment of transit crisis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/Subway_Timeline_03-1/b04f2c2f2.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;Madison McVeigh/CityLab
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-3&quot; readability=&quot;71.101156069364&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Three broad lines of history provide an explanation. The first is the postwar lure of the suburbs and the automobile—the embodiment of modernity in its day. The second is the interminable battles of control between the city and the private transit companies, and between the city and the state government. The third is the treadmill created by rising costs and the buildup of deferred maintenance—an ever-expanding maintenance backlog that eventually consumed any funds made available for expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;To see exactly how and why New York’s subway went off the rails requires going all the way back to the beginning. What follows is a 113-year timeline of the subway’s history, organized by these three narratives (with the caveat that no history is fully complete). Follow along chronologically or thematically for the historical context of the system's sorry state, or use a playful “map” of the subway's decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1904: First subway opens&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The private Interborough Rapid Transit company opened the first underground subway line in 1904, stretching from West Harlem to Grand Central. After taking over the existing elevated railways, it created a near-monopoly on rapid transit in Manhattan and the Bronx. The Brooklyn Rapid Transit company dominated the elevated transit business in that borough, as well as its connections to Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-4&quot; readability=&quot;106&quot;&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1913: The “Dual Contracts”&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In an agreement called the “Dual Contracts,” the city entrusted the two private subway companies with a radical expansion of the system. Almost immediately, municipal leaders regretted the decision. Many were dissatisfied with the financial return from the investment of over $200 million—more than half the total cost of construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The dispute went beyond mere finance, however: The subway became a symbol of the battle between public and private interest, and a populist touchstone for a succession of mayors. Their most important leverage was control of the subway fare: By refusing to let the private companies charge more than a nickel for decades, inflation meant that in 1948 riders were effectively paying less than half what they had been paying in 1904.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/key_01-1/af32bcfb5.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1922: Independent Subway&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Opposition to the private transit duopoly was the centerpiece of Mayor John Hylan’s administration. He announced a vast new “Independent” subway system, to be built and owned by the municipal government. Unlike earlier subway lines, which pushed deep into undeveloped territory, many of the IND lines closely paralleled existing private routes in order to compete with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real estate industry was one of the most important constituencies supporting the development of the subway system in the early years. Developers enjoyed a symbiotic relationship with the subway, which was extended into empty fields that were then swiftly and profitably blanketed with apartment houses whose residents then filled the trains. With the construction of the IND, that bargain began to break down—they saw new subways as more of a tax burden than a generator of big speculative profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/key_02-1/e0fb7d386.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1939: World’s Fair&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;As visitors to New York’s 1939 World’s Fair gazed on General Motors’ vision of the world to come at its Futurama exhibit, they didn’t see new trains and subways. Instead, they saw cars traveling quickly on wide new superhighways to bungalows in a bucolic landscape. The car was viewed as the height of modernity; many dismissed public transit as a grimy relic of an earlier age. The postwar federal government would spend what it took to make the suburban dream come true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/key_03/3e1d5ddc0.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1940: City takes over the private subways&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia took advantage of the disastrous finances of the BMT and IRT, ravaged by the Depression and the ban on fare increases, to acquire both companies. That strained the city’s resources, with a total cost of $326,248,000. The cost was not much lower than that of building the entire IND network, and while it did unify the system, it didn’t produce a single additional mile of subway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/key_04/5d51dbfe8.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1940: Sixth Avenue subway opens&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The Sixth Avenue line was one of the core segments of the IND’s Manhattan network. It was to be followed soon after by the Second Avenue line, but New Yorkers ended up waiting over 70 years for even a tiny segment of that project to be completed. The Sixth Avenue subway was an astonishing engineering achievement: The work had to weave around both the PATH train tunnel and the supports for the busy elevated line above. Such wizardry did not come cheaply, and it was emblematic of the high standards—and costs—on all the new IND lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-5&quot; readability=&quot;74&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IND lines built by the municipal government cost an average of $9 million per mile, which was 125 percent higher than the earlier “Dual Contracts” lines. The cost per mile of Sixth Avenue was about four times as high as the original subway. This pattern of high construction cost persists to the present day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/key_04/5d51dbfe8.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1946: Subway ridership peaks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Subway ridership has never been as high as it was in 1946, and a precipitous decline began in the late 1940s as automobiles became widely available. The busiest station in the system, Times Square, saw its ridership drop from 102,511,841 riders in 1946 to 66,447,227 riders in 1953. Subway expansion would become increasingly difficult to justify as New Yorkers were abandoning the existing system—even though outward expansion was just what was needed to keep the subway as the region’s primary mode of transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/key_06/0ba6b9b12.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1947: End of the five-cent fare&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;With the subways now in municipal hands, a doubling of the fare was finally negotiated. Years of deferred maintenance by the cash-strapped private companies had become increasingly evident. But by then, fare hikes only exacerbated the problem of declining ridership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/key_07/c2a66fd78.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==&quot; title=&quot;Click and drag to move&quot; width=&quot;15&quot; height=&quot;15&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-6&quot; readability=&quot;59.765765765766&quot;&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1951: Transit Bond issue&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;After 1945, the City of New York found itself in constrained financial circumstances. The growth and modernization of its infrastructure necessitated substantial borrowing, but the city was already burdened by an enormous Depression-era debt and faced a state-mandated debt limit. In November 1948, the Board of Transportation recommended that the city seek a $500 million exemption from the debt limit to permit the revival of the Second Avenue Subway plan, along with several outer-borough projects like the Utica Avenue line that mayors since have continued to tout, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpa.org/article/is-mayor-bill-de-blasio%E2%80%99s-utica-avenue-brooklyn-subway-extension-dead&quot;&gt;most recently Bill de Blasio&lt;/a&gt;. (Indeed, the wish list for subway construction has changed little to the present day.) The request passed in a statewide referendum on November 6, 1951.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-7&quot; readability=&quot;87&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;But rather than being used as promised to continue the prewar pattern of expansion, most of the money was instead diverted to eroding the mountain of deferred maintenance that had built up during the war and the Depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/key_08/bb01530a0.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1953: Creation of the Transit Authority&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;To ensure that fare policy never again became captive to electoral politics, many civic leaders advocated for the creation of an independent state authority to administer the city’s transit system, comparable to the Port Authority or Robert Moses’ Triborough authority. The subways were thus handed over to the state-created Transit Authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;But the institutional reshuffle did not resolve the fundamental financial problems of a system; ridership continued to decline and maintenance remained deferred. The state and municipal governments were both unwilling to provide the subsidy that would have been needed to adequately sustain the system. Unlike highways, transit was still seen as a business that should make a profit, and not as a public service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/key_09/3fdb3d10f.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1956: The Interstate Highway Act&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;With the encouragement of President Eisenhower, Congress passed an act providing lavish federal funding for a cross-country network of expressways. The 1950s saw the construction of over a dozen major expressways and bridges in the New York region. This construction program rivaled or even exceeded the earlier subway boom. And unlike the subways, all of it benefited from federal largesse. Celebrating the completion of the Bruckner Expressway in the Bronx, Mayor Robert Wagner boasted, “This two and one-half mile stretch of elevated expressway cost more than $34 million, of which 90 percent was put up by the federal government.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/key_10/a5c8f9ec9.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1950s: Growth of the suburbs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;By the postwar period, the majority of population growth in the New York region was taking place outside of the five boroughs. New York City no longer dominated the region to the same extent that it once had, and the growing political power of the suburbs hindered funding requests for subway projects that many suburbanites believed did not benefit them. Manhattan and Brooklyn shrank from 1940 to 1960, while Nassau and Suffolk counties essentially tripled in population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-8&quot; readability=&quot;123.40206185567&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Yet New York City still planned subway projects as if the suburbs didn’t exist. In the postwar period, most greenfield real estate development shifted out of the city entirely and into the surrounding counties. Instead of being built around transit, new developments were centered on expressways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/key_10/a5c8f9ec9.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1965: Creation of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In an effort to address the geographic and financial limitations of the Transit Authority, Governor Nelson Rockefeller created a new regional authority that would ultimately control the subways and commuter railways. It was given the toll revenue from the Triborough Authority’s bridges and tunnels, which had been the financial basis of Robert Moses’ bureaucratic empire, to provide the revenue needed to subsidize the transit system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;But while the new authority’s service area stretched beyond the five boroughs for the first time, it never made efforts to turn the subway and commuter railroads into a combined regional transit system. (For such a model, consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2017/04/fixing-a-fractured-paris/521967/&quot;&gt;Paris’ Regional Express Network&lt;/a&gt;). New York may be an extraordinarily transit-oriented city, but once the municipal boundary is crossed into Nassau and Westchester, transit—especially other than commutes to Manhattan—is near as foreign a concept as it is in a wealthy Los Angeles suburb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/key_12/0df16b496.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1968: Program for Action&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The new MTA announced the last of its comprehensive plans to expand the network on the pharaonic scale of prewar construction. It proposed a number of new lines in the outer boroughs, a full Second Avenue subway, and a “superexpress” line along the LIRR in Queens. Construction began on several of the projects, but even those were only completed in truncated form or abandoned entirely. Never again would the MTA seriously plan major network expansion. Instead, the only discussion is of projects like the new Second Avenue line or 7 train extension, which are of a scale that would barely have registered on the city’s consciousness in the 1910s and ‘20s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/key_13/039d15197.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1973: Closure of the Third Avenue Elevated&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;As transit ridership dropped from prewar level, segments of the city’s subway and elevated system were abandoned entirely. While elevated lines had previously been closed to be replaced with adjacent subway lines, they were now closed without their promised replacements ever being built, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2016/12/mapping-the-history-of-the-second-ave-subway/511790/&quot;&gt;including, infamously, the Second Avenue elevated line in Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;. The Bronx segment of the Third Avenue Elevated was the last major segment of the system to be shut down without replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/key_14/bc835d870.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1975: Fiscal crisis and Second Avenue abandonment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The centerpiece of the Program for Action, the Second Avenue Subway, had begun construction in the early 1970s. But with the complete disintegration of the city’s finances, construction simply could no longer be supported. The disconnected tunnel segments have lain underused beneath the streets ever since. Several bond issues intended to finance subway expansion had also been defeated, and the limited funds that were available ended up being diverted to the system’s dilapidated trains and stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/key_15/a1b5eb42d.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1988: Opening of three-stop Jamaica extension&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The 1968 Program for Action proposed a number of projects intended to improve subway service in some of the neighborhoods that had sprouted up in the postwar years, particularly in Queens. Unfortunately, few of the projects were built. One small remnant was the extension of the E train to Jamaica; the J and Z trains were also moved off a nearby elevated line into the new tunnel along Archer Avenue. But a combination of limited funds and community opposition derailed more substantial expansion plans. Even simple extensions along existing rail corridors had become out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/key_16/258eb1a3c.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/Subway_Timeline_05/26eaf0509.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;Jonathan English/Madison McVeigh/CityLab
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;2017: First phase of the Second Avenue subway opens&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The Second Avenue Subway has been part of the city’s transit plans since the creation of the IND in the 1920s. It was intended to replace two elevated lines that shut down in the 1940s and 1950s respectively. An attempt to begin construction was abandoned due to the financial crisis of the 1970s and only a few tunnel segments were built. Over the years, plans were scaled down, and its length was trimmed to only three stops on the Upper East Side. The prospect for future phases remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/04/key_17/2faf9221e.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Beyond: The high cost of forgotten history&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many other world cities also slowed their pace of subway construction in the early postwar years. They, too, succumbed to the appeal of the automobile, or struggled with debt and destruction accumulated during the Depression and Second World War. But by the 1960s, this had changed. London opened two new Underground lines in the 1960s and 1970s. Paris began its vast RER project to connect all of its commuter rail lines, linking the rapidly growing suburbs with the historic core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-9&quot; readability=&quot;57.418864097363&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, New York’s subway system had deteriorated to such a dismal state that nearly all available funds had to be diverted to basic maintenance and overhaul. The city’s declining population and fiscal troubles made expansion nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Now, New York’s economy has turned around, the population is growing, and the city is in a relatively good financial position. Still, the maintenance backlog is devouring capital spending. Staggering subway construction costs—by far the highest in the world—mean that whatever funding is available does not go very far at all. Old problems that precluded subway construction in the past echo in the present day: There is still no meaningful integration between the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/nyregion/congestion-pricing-manhattan-albany-fail.html&quot;&gt;subway and suburban transit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gothamgazette.com/state/7607-after-forcing-city-to-fund-subway-plan-cuomo-forecasts-next-mta-budget-battle&quot;&gt;the mayor and governor carry on the same types of jurisdictional battles&lt;/a&gt;, and the subway has not managed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/mta-runs-low-on-funds-cuts-back-station-upgrade-program-1522747921&quot;&gt;step off the treadmill of deferred repairs&lt;/a&gt;. These problems have deep roots, and overcoming them will not be a simple matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;c-related-content u-full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;c-related-content__title&quot;&gt;Recommended&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-10&quot; readability=&quot;69&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Most challenging of all is the shockingly high cost of subway construction. Anyone would expect costs to have risen since the early days of the system, but the cost of the proposed Second Avenue line is nearly eight times what a comparable project cost in the 1980s, when adjusted for inflation.* Procurement problems and labor relations issues are partial explanations, but the most important factor may be the wholesale loss of experience resulting from the decade-long gaps in construction. One of the distinct characteristics of European systems with much lower building costs is continuous construction: Every time they complete a new line, they are able to apply the lessons from the one previous. But in New York, from the opening of the Archer Avenue Line in 1988 to the construction of the 7 train extension and Second Avenue lines in the 2010s, virtually all the experience and knowledge that had been built up in subway construction had atrophied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The same situation risks repeating itself, as the Second Avenue construction has been completed with no new construction immediately on the horizon. The subway’s cost-induced construction paralysis becomes more severe with every passing decade. We must learn from history in order to break it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;*CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that per-mile construction costs were double what they were in the 1980s.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Should I just stop attempting to make these trivial patches? (2004)</title>

<description>&lt;pre itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[ Linux-kernel added back into the cc, because I actually think this is &lt;br /&gt;important. ]&lt;p&gt;On Tue, 21 Dec 2004, Jesper Juhl wrote:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; Should I just stop attemting to make these trivial cleanups/fixes/whatever &lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; patches? are they more noice than gain? am I being a pain to more skilled &lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; people on lkml or can you all live with my, sometimes quite ignorant, &lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; patches?&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; I do try to learn from the feedback I get, and I like to think that my &lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; patches are gradually getting a bit better, but if I'm more of a bother &lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; than a help I might as well stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To me, the biggest thing with small patches is not necessarily the patch &lt;br /&gt;itself. I think that much more important than the patch is the fact that &lt;br /&gt;people get used to the notion that they can change the kernel - not just &lt;br /&gt;on an intellectual level (&quot;I understand that the GPL means that I have the &lt;br /&gt;right to change my kernel&quot;), but on a more practical level (&quot;Hey, I did &lt;br /&gt;that small change&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And whether it ends up being the right thing or not, that's how everybody&lt;br /&gt;starts out. It's simply not possible to &quot;get into&quot; the kernel without&lt;br /&gt;starting out small, and making mistakes. So I very much encourage it, even&lt;br /&gt;if I often don't have the time to actually worry about small patches, and &lt;br /&gt;I try to get suckers^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hother developers like Rusty to try to &lt;br /&gt;acts as quality control and a &quot;gathering place&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Btw, this is why even &quot;trivial patches&quot; really do take time - they often &lt;br /&gt;have trivial mistakes in them, and it's not just because there are more &lt;br /&gt;inexperienced people doing them - most of _my_ mistakes tend to be at the &lt;br /&gt;truly idiotic level, just because it &quot;looked obvious&quot;, and then there's &lt;br /&gt;something that I miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So at one level I absolutely _hate_ trivial patches: they take time and &lt;br /&gt;effort to merge, and individually the patch itself is often not really &lt;br /&gt;obviously &quot;worth it&quot;. But at the same time, I think the trivial patches &lt;br /&gt;are among the most important ones - exactly because they are the &quot;entry&quot; &lt;br /&gt;patches for every new developer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just try really hard to find somebody else to worry about them ;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(It's not a thankful job, btw, exactly because it _looks_ so trivial. It's&lt;br /&gt;easy to point to 99 patches that are absolutely obvious, and complain&lt;br /&gt;about the fact that they haven't been merged. But they take time to merge&lt;br /&gt;exactly because of that one patch that _did_ look obvious, but wasn't.  &lt;br /&gt;And actually, it's usually not 99:1, it's usually more like 10:1 or&lt;br /&gt;something).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So please don't stop. Yes, those trivial patches _are_ a bother. Damn, &lt;br /&gt;they are _horrible_. But at the same time, the devil is in the detail, and &lt;br /&gt;they are needed in the long run. Both the patches themselves, and the &lt;br /&gt;people that grew up on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linus&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;To unsubscribe from this list: send the line &quot;unsubscribe linux-kernel&quot; in&lt;br /&gt;the body of a message to majordomo@vger.kernel.org&lt;br /&gt;More majordomo info at  &lt;a href=&quot;http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html&quot;&gt;http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please read the FAQ at  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tux.org/lkml/&quot;&gt;http://www.tux.org/lkml/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

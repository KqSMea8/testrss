&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s funny how some things that hardly seem significant in their day dramatically change our lives. Or, in Steve’s case, the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, it was a phone call from a secretive little company of 22 people called General Magic. I was at NeXT, getting to do things with Steve Jobs that seemed crazier than the insane things I sometimes dream at night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, this little company with the world’s coolest name and logo, had the most compelling vision I had ever heard: a little battery-powered device that let you write electronic postcards that float up to what they called the cloud, and from there to a friend’s device. I have wondered 1,000 times how that call changed my world when I said yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Steve heard, he took me on a long walk around Redwood City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2:&lt;/strong&gt; As we walked, the most persuasive man alive made me feel the full weight of this decision.  Pixar had landed a deal with Disney to make a full-length movie. We had a design for a dual-processor computer that would solve our speed problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite our heated battles, I had grown fond of Steve. He gushed when he talked about his sister Mona, whom he hadn’t met until he was 27. It seemed like he was on the verge of crying as he talked about how she had become one of his very best friends. I thought he might burst into tears when he sat cross-legged on my office floor the morning his trusted VP of Engineering, Bud Tribble, left for our dreaded enemy Sun. They wrote a press release about Bud to rub salt in our wounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I told Steve that General Magic’s vision was so compelling that I had to be part of it, he told me how he admired the team. Four of them were core to the original Macintosh: Bill Atkinson, Andy Hertzfeld, Joanna Hoffman and Susan Kare. It was true; he stayed in touch with all four until his death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years after that walk, he would visit General Magic to play with our touch-screen device that had no physical keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Silicon Valley companies obsess over their cultures, but few of them have cultures so strong you know you’re at someplace unique when you work there. Apple, Google, Netflix, and Amazon have that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General Magic had it, and I think it came from Andy Hertzfeld, whom we called Yoda. In his booming voice and with his empathic way of speaking, he’d say “We poured…LOVE into the Mac and it…&lt;em&gt;radiated&lt;/em&gt; it BACK from the screen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that’s how we ended up with Tony Fadell. He went on to help Apple develop the iPod and iPhone, and then founded Nest. He didn’t know what General Magic was building when he applied. He only knew that Joanna, Andy and Bill were there and rumors were the product was super cool. He called every day and begged for a job. The Andy Hertzfeld culture of passion ruled the day and that’s how Tony got in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My jean jacket from back then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 4:&lt;/strong&gt; There is a saying among authors: you might be a nice person, but you must be mean to your protagonist. Readers want to know what happens when your protagonist faces an impossible situation.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought the universe had gone too far with its Steve Jobs story by the time he arrived for a demo with Andy and Bill. NeXT had been forced to get out of hardware and his dream of running a computer company was over. Pixar had struggled with Disney and Toy Story after years of trying to be a hardware and then a software company, burning a lot of Steve’s savings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt a little sad to see him in our lobby, knowing he would never achieve what he once had. He had wanted it so badly and had poured all of himself into it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc-attachments&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;cakedoc-lightbox-link&quot; href=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/4wMJL0krjM0F_1531240875683.png&quot; itemprop=&quot;sharedContent&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cakedoc-image&quot; src=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/4wMJL0krjM0F_1531240875683.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/4wMJL0krjM0F_1531240875683.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/4wMJL0krjM0F_1531240875683.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 5:&lt;/strong&gt; After the demo, Andy sent him home with a Teletouch. Putting one in Steve’s hand was entirely different from lending one to any other busy person. They might turn it on for 15 minutes to get the gist but Steve sent Telecards back and forth to Andy for a couple of weeks. He wasn’t one to miss any details. Steve told Andy that after using it he thought the touchscreen keyboard was a good design choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve would have seen the amazing stamps that Susan Kare designed to place on Telecards. Susan had been Apple’s first artist and was NeXT’s Creative Director before coming to General Magic. She designed our brilliant logo. Placing a thumbs-up icon on a message to show that you liked it felt like something which could catch on.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the first iPhone, we had applications and AT&amp;amp;T was building a marketplace on their network. My favorite was maps from StreetLight that gave you turn-by-turn directions. Oh my God. That felt like an app everyone would love. I don’t know whether Steve got to see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc-attachments&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;cakedoc-lightbox-link&quot; href=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/KbTW037GDphR_1531241213493.jpeg&quot; itemprop=&quot;sharedContent&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cakedoc-image&quot; src=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/KbTW037GDphR_1531241213493.jpeg?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/KbTW037GDphR_1531241213493.jpeg?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/KbTW037GDphR_1531241213493.jpeg?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 6:&lt;/strong&gt; The most persuasive man in tech no longer appeared to be Steve, but our CEO Marc Porat. Marc had produced a detailed vision of the product while at Apple. He collected a team of legends, persuaded brands like Apple, Sony, Motorola and AT&amp;amp;T to join, and prepared to take the company public on a concept, led by Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every great story needs a villain, and Steve’s was John Sculley. When Steve drove his new silver Mercedes to NeXT and showed it off in the parking lot, we glanced at each other and wondered if the first sign of middle age had arrived. He had two loud, black, air-cooled Porsche 911s that he drove like bats out of Hell, and we were cool with those. But this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it was Mike Slade who suggested a possible way to have him get rid of it: tell him we heard Sculley bought that model too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve’s nemesis had made General Magic possible by allowing Marc Porat to spin it out of Apple. Sculley served on General Magic’s board. He had been considered a marketing genius when the Mac regained momentum after Steve was forced out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He became General Magic’s villain too when he surprised us and released the Newton, which competed with us and discredited the category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc-attachments&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;cakedoc-lightbox-link&quot; href=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/bpG4H7K26x76_1531241327609.jpeg&quot; itemprop=&quot;sharedContent&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cakedoc-image&quot; src=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/bpG4H7K26x76_1531241327609.jpeg?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/bpG4H7K26x76_1531241327609.jpeg?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/bpG4H7K26x76_1531241327609.jpeg?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 7:&lt;/strong&gt; Popular Wharton business professor Adam Grant believes the most important employees are disagreeable givers. They are the ones who tell you what you don’t want to hear but need to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never wanted to play that role. I’d much rather be liked. But at General Magic, amidst the incredible passion and optimism, I came to believe that I had to be that guy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, we needed a cloud. Marc brilliantly persuaded AT&amp;amp;T to invest $100 million and we hired a huge team to write a special language called Telescript to make it go. I couldn’t understand why we needed that when AOL could easily send our Telecards. So Steve Case and I went watersliding one night at a Sheraton and, well, AOL made an application to deliver Telecards. Millions of customers already had AOL accounts. Win!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I ran into Bill Fallon in New York, the man in charge of building the AT&amp;amp;T cloud. He understandably griped about a mystery person at Magic who had betrayed them and did a deal with AOL. I sympathized because that must have been awful. It was a nice evening and, well, I didn’t get around to telling him what disagreeable jerk was responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love you, Bill. It wasn’t personal. Can you ever forgive me? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc-attachments&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;cakedoc-lightbox-link&quot; href=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/LvW1dT65FvsL_1531241456883.jpeg&quot; itemprop=&quot;sharedContent&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cakedoc-image&quot; src=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/LvW1dT65FvsL_1531241456883.jpeg?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/LvW1dT65FvsL_1531241456883.jpeg?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/LvW1dT65FvsL_1531241456883.jpeg?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, I am ready for Season Two. Get on with it! lol&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 8:&lt;/strong&gt; When it became clear we had a brilliant vision 10 years before it was technically possible, General Magic came to an excruciating end. Tony went on to build the iPhone, Andy Rubin built Android, Pierre Omidyar built eBay, Megan Smith became VP of Google and then America’s CTO, Kevin Lynch built apple Watch…I could keep going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So remarkable was the story, filmmaker Sarah Kerruish and lawyer Mike Stern (both former Magicians) formed a team to produce a powerfully emotional film about it. It premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival a few months ago to rave reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they called me to interview for the film, I believed I had buried my disagreeable personna I hated so much ages ago. I would be my most positive self on camera. But they tricked me. Steve Jarrett, the eager young intern I had hired there, wrote the questions the filmmakers asked. He knew how to ask the questions that forced me to talk about our weaknesses. AND THOSE ARE THE ANSWERS THEY USED IN THE FILM! Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it’s a great film (&lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/167120917&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;teaser&lt;/a&gt;) that will show &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/general-magic-bay-area-premiere-tickets-47486834400&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in San Jose on July 26th&lt;/a&gt;. Tell Netflix and Amazon it &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;needs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to be on their streaming services as a critical and fascinating part of Silicon Valley history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magicians: set the record straight where I got it wrong &amp;amp; fill in the important things I missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc-attachments&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;cakedoc-lightbox-link&quot; href=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/z3ZTxLwC6jrq_1531242086064.png&quot; itemprop=&quot;sharedContent&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cakedoc-image&quot; src=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/z3ZTxLwC6jrq_1531242086064.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/z3ZTxLwC6jrq_1531242086064.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/z3ZTxLwC6jrq_1531242086064.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WOW.....I hope this makes it to Netflix.....I can hardly wait to see it somehow.....I would be happy to coordinate a viewing in Las Vegas.....I am sure I could get Tony Hseih's interest and he would love to showcase this somewhere in Downtown Las Vegas (not the Strip).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great story. Did you then join Jobs at Apple?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks, wxwax. I've always wondered if Steve's interaction with General Magic influenced him at Apple. Maybe Tony or Andy would know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I helped my young sons start SmugMug, thinking the most important thing I could do in life was to help them achieve their dreams, and then Apple called me several times to see if I was interested in running MobileMe. It wasn't Steve or an offer, just an opportunity to interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I declined, another group called to see if they could acquire SmugMug. We had a couple of really good meetings but in the end we wanted to keep it as a family company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot wait to see this movie. This is Silicon Valley legend, and I really respect and like a lot of the characters I already know. Thanks for sharing your short story, Baldy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an amazing story!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love your stories about Silicone Valley even though, or maybe because, I have no real understanding of how computers or the internet actually works! How was it that so many innovative and brilliant all came together, seemingly out of nowhere, to be in the same place at the same time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another fascinating inside story. Thanks. I remember seeing the NeXT at a trade show and thinking it was the most brilliant computer ever. I tried to convince my boss that we needed some, but failed. I wonder how it would look to me today...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to see this sometime. Hope it does go to streaming!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brilliant !!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is amazing! I have always loved your stories, Chris. It is so incredible to have this view into your experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris: There were probably some hard feelings a couple of decades ago but none lingering, not even those that may have been there wouldn't have been squarely aimed at you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since you were in charge of dealing with 3'd party developers I think I always realized you had a hand in the onboarding of AOL, though until I read your post I always assumed the idea originated with Sony. In the end it didn't really matter - the presence of AOL on SONY MagicLink's did not generate device sales any more than our name did, and ultimately AT&amp;amp;T PersonaLink was utterly dependent on device sales and unlike AOL, spent a fair amount of money to actually attempt to actually generate device sales. As you'll see in point 2 below we saw an urgent need to diversify into a PC application about a year before the MagicLink launched, but as we both know that idea died a slow, agonizing death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two somewhat related points that I don't recall if we discussed or not which could have possibly (though not probably) reversed the fortunes of at least our part of the General Magic universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. AT&amp;amp;T spent all that money developing what we would today call a cloud based platform for &quot;communicating applications using General Magic's Telescript technology.&quot; Our deal with General Magic obligated us to be the first to develop any application that had anything to do with Telescript, and that was the GM/PersonaLink messaging application. If all General Magic wanted was a then current state of the art e-mail network, we could have made that available a week after our initial meeting with Marc Porat, Rich Miller and Bill Atkinson when they first visited us at a Bell Labs facility in NJ. No, it had to have Telescript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my recollection no 3'd party apps were ever developed using Telescript, including AOL's. In truth there wasn't much Telescript in the PersonaLink Mail application - I think it was primarily tied to authenticating users and providing a rather clever user directory, but it was a start, and again, a core contractual item we were obligated to meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While AT&amp;amp;T certainly had an issue with AOL, we never quite understood why General Magic didn't have an isssue with it (at least when we thought it was all Sony's doing), as it substantially compromised the value of it's whole Telescript proposition, which, despite various public pronouncements to the contrary, was obviously a distant second in importance internally to MagicCap. Various Magicians have indicated their disdain for John Sculley and Apple for upstaging General Magic's device - can you see the similarity AT&amp;amp;T saw for the introduction of an AOL messaging app on MagicCap devices to Apple's action? We had a similar reaction to Motorola's tie up with an outfit named RadioMail. Perhaps you were involved with that one also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. We campaigned long and hard for a MagicCap for PC's sofware app as it became apparent that Sony's $800+ device wasn't likely to fly off of store shelves and Motorola's $1500+ device might not ever make it to market, along with the phantom devices of other alliance members Panasonic and Philips. Rich a company as we were, AT&amp;amp;T could not afford to dole out Sony MagicLink's for free or very little to tens of thousands of customers, but we easily could have and would have distributed software to millions of customers for free, which we believe would have put tens of thousands of users on the PersonaLink network, generating revenue for both AT&amp;amp;T and General Magic, and perhaps providing a &quot;tandem&quot; device-computer solution that would have benefited device partners - which was ultimately the architecture that won that generation of handheld devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our requests went nowhere for quite awhile, and were ultimately undertaken by a too little, too late internal effort at General Magic that never produced a viable product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really interesting perspective. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HI Chris....I know you had already screened this at Tribeca, but, did you attend the screening last night in San Jose? Or, did anyone else on CAKE?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did!! Great theater, 1,100-person capacity crowd, big names were there + media, and I felt mobbed by people I knew until the wee hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone I saw there had read my various stories about Steve Jobs and were asking for more. Some conversations about Cake. Andy Hertzfeld is willing to sit down with us and give feedback on Cake's design, navigation, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great feedback about the movie. Hopefully it gets picked up by Netflix or Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I flew the flag and wore my General Magic T.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got invited to the movie premiere by @Chris at the California Theatre in downtown San Jose. I honestly didn't know what to expect so I came way too early, but all dressed up. While waiting for @Chris, Toni and @Kevin to come I snapped a photo of the billboard:&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Reddit Security Incident</title>
<link>https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/93qnm5/we_had_a_security_incident_heres_what_you_need_to/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/93qnm5/we_had_a_security_incident_heres_what_you_need_to/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;s570a4-10 iEJDri&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;s570a4-14 kYTLgH&quot;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;: A hacker broke into a few of Reddit’s systems and managed to access some user data, including some current email addresses and a 2007 database backup containing old salted and hashed passwords. Since then we’ve been conducting a painstaking investigation to figure out just what was accessed, and to improve our systems and processes to prevent this from happening again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s570a4-10 iEJDri&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;s570a4-14 kYTLgH&quot;&gt;What happened?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s570a4-10 iEJDri&quot;&gt;On June 19, we learned that between June 14 and June 18, an attacker compromised a few of our employees’ accounts with our cloud and source code hosting providers. Already having our primary access points for code and infrastructure behind strong authentication requiring two factor authentication (2FA), we learned that SMS-based authentication is not nearly as secure as we would hope, and the main attack was via SMS intercept. We point this out to encourage everyone here to move to token-based 2FA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s570a4-10 iEJDri&quot;&gt;Although this was a serious attack, the attacker did not gain write access to Reddit systems; they gained read-only access to some systems that contained backup data, source code and other logs. They were not able to alter Reddit information, and we have taken steps since the event to further lock down and rotate all production secrets and API keys, and to enhance our logging and monitoring systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s570a4-10 iEJDri&quot;&gt;Now that we've concluded our investigation sufficiently to understand the impact, we want to share what we know, how it may impact you, and what we've done to protect us and you from this kind of attack in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s570a4-10 iEJDri&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;s570a4-14 kYTLgH&quot;&gt;What information was involved?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s570a4-10 iEJDri&quot;&gt;Since June 19, we’ve been working with cloud and source code hosting providers to get the best possible understanding of what data the attacker accessed. We want you to know about two key areas of user data that was accessed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;s570a4-12 lnAcJj&quot; readability=&quot;-0.97607973421927&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;s570a4-11 fcAyyj&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s570a4-10 iEJDri&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;s570a4-14 kYTLgH&quot;&gt;All Reddit data from 2007 and before including account credentials and email addresses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;s570a4-12 lnAcJj&quot; readability=&quot;4.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;s570a4-11 fcAyyj&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s570a4-10 iEJDri&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;s570a4-15 bDsWbe&quot;&gt;What was accessed:&lt;/em&gt; A complete copy of an old database backup containing very early Reddit user data -- from the site’s launch in 2005 through May 2007. In Reddit’s first years it had many fewer features, so the most significant data contained in this backup are account credentials (username + salted &lt;em class=&quot;s570a4-15 bDsWbe&quot;&gt;hashed&lt;/em&gt; passwords), email addresses, and all content (mostly public, but also private messages) from way back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;s570a4-11 fcAyyj&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s570a4-10 iEJDri&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;s570a4-15 bDsWbe&quot;&gt;How to tell if your information was included:&lt;/em&gt; We are sending a message to affected users and resetting passwords on accounts where the credentials might still be valid. If you signed up for Reddit after 2007, you’re clear here. Check your PMs and/or email inbox: we will be notifying you soon if you’ve been affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;s570a4-11 fcAyyj&quot; readability=&quot;-0.94674556213018&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s570a4-10 iEJDri&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;s570a4-14 kYTLgH&quot;&gt;Email digests sent by Reddit in June 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;s570a4-12 lnAcJj&quot; readability=&quot;3.7728706624606&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;s570a4-11 fcAyyj&quot; readability=&quot;2.8695652173913&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s570a4-10 iEJDri&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;s570a4-15 bDsWbe&quot;&gt;What was accessed:&lt;/em&gt; Logs containing the email digests we sent between June 3 and June 17, 2018. The logs contain the digest emails themselves -- they &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;s570a4-27 koemcl&quot; href=&quot;https://i.redd.it/dtdpfncm6dd11.png&quot;&gt;look like this&lt;/a&gt;. The digests connect a username to the associated email address and contain suggested posts from select popular and safe-for-work subreddits you subscribe to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;s570a4-11 fcAyyj&quot; readability=&quot;4.6463022508039&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s570a4-10 iEJDri&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;s570a4-15 bDsWbe&quot;&gt;How to tell if your information was included:&lt;/em&gt; If you don’t have an email address associated with your account or your “email digests” user preference was unchecked during that period, you’re not affected. Otherwise, search your email inbox for emails from &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;s570a4-27 koemcl&quot; href=&quot;mailto:noreply@redditmail.com&quot;&gt;noreply@redditmail.com&lt;/a&gt; between June 3-17, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;s570a4-10 iEJDri&quot;&gt;As the attacker had read access to our storage systems, other data was accessed such as Reddit source code, internal logs, configuration files and other employee workspace files, but these two areas are the most significant categories of user data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s570a4-10 iEJDri&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;s570a4-14 kYTLgH&quot;&gt;What is Reddit doing about it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s570a4-10 iEJDri&quot;&gt;Some highlights. We:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;s570a4-12 lnAcJj&quot; readability=&quot;2.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;s570a4-11 fcAyyj&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s570a4-10 iEJDri&quot;&gt;Reported the issue to law enforcement and are cooperating with their investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;s570a4-11 fcAyyj&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s570a4-10 iEJDri&quot;&gt;Are messaging user accounts if there’s a chance the credentials taken reflect the account’s current password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;s570a4-11 fcAyyj&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s570a4-10 iEJDri&quot;&gt;Took measures to guarantee that additional points of privileged access to Reddit’s systems are more secure (e.g., enhanced logging, more encryption and requiring token-based 2FA to gain entry since we suspect weaknesses inherent to SMS-based 2FA to be the root cause of this incident.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;s570a4-10 iEJDri&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;s570a4-14 kYTLgH&quot;&gt;What can you do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s570a4-10 iEJDri&quot;&gt;First, check whether your data was included in either of the categories called out above by following the instructions there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s570a4-10 iEJDri&quot;&gt;If your account credentials were affected and there’s a chance the credentials relate to the password you’re currently using on Reddit, we’ll make you reset your Reddit account password. Whether or not Reddit prompts you to change your password, think about whether you still use the password you used on Reddit 11 years ago on any other sites today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s570a4-10 iEJDri&quot;&gt;If your email address was affected, think about whether there’s anything on your Reddit account that you wouldn’t want associated back to that address. You can find instructions on how to remove information from your account on this &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;s570a4-27 koemcl&quot; href=&quot;https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/using-reddit/your-reddit-account/removing-your-reddit-data&quot;&gt;help page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s570a4-10 iEJDri&quot;&gt;And, as in all things, a strong unique password and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;s570a4-27 koemcl&quot; href=&quot;https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/using-reddit/your-reddit-account/how-set-two-factor-authentication&quot;&gt;enabling 2FA&lt;/a&gt; (which we only provide via an authenticator app, not SMS) is recommended for all users, and be alert for potential phishing or scams.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Learning Math for Machine Learning</title>
<link>https://blog.ycombinator.com/learning-math-for-machine-learning/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.ycombinator.com/learning-math-for-machine-learning/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vincent Chen is a student at Stanford University studying Computer Science. He is also a Research Assistant at the Stanford AI Lab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not entirely clear what level of mathematics is necessary to get started in machine learning, especially for those who didn’t study math or statistics in school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this piece, my goal is to suggest the mathematical background necessary to build products or conduct academic research in machine learning. These suggestions are derived from conversations with machine learning engineers, researchers, and educators, as well as my own experiences in both machine learning research and industry roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To frame the math prerequisites, I first propose different mindsets and strategies for approaching your math education outside of traditional classroom settings. Then, I outline the specific backgrounds necessary for different kinds of machine learning work, as these subjects range from high school-level statistics and calculus to the latest developments in probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). By the end of the post, my hope is that you’ll have a sense of the math education you’ll need to be effective in your machine learning work, whatever that may be!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To preface the piece, I acknowledge that learning styles/frameworks/resources are unique to a learner’s personal needs/goals— your opinions would be appreciated in &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17664084&quot;&gt;the discussion on HN&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Note on Math Anxiety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It turns out that a lot of people — including engineers — are scared of math. To begin, I want to address the myth of “being good at math.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, people who are good at math have lots of practice doing math. As a result, they’re comfortable being stuck while doing math. A student’s mindset, as opposed to innate ability, is the primary predictor of one’s ability to learn math (as shown by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/10/the-myth-of-im-bad-at-math/280914/&quot;&gt;recent studies&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, it will take time and effort to achieve this state of comfort, but it’s certainly not something you’re born with. The rest of this post will help you figure out what level of mathematical foundation you need and outline strategies for building it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soft prerequisites, we assume basic comfortability with &lt;a href=&quot;http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-linalg.pdf&quot;&gt;linear algebra/matrix calculus&lt;/a&gt; (so you don’t get stuck on notation) and introductory &lt;a href=&quot;http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-prob.pdf&quot;&gt;probability&lt;/a&gt;. We also encourage basic programming competency, which we support as a tool to learn math in context. Afterwards, you can fine-tune your focus based on the kind of work you’re excited about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Learn Math Outside of School&lt;/strong&gt; I believe the best way to learn math is as a full-time job (i.e. as a student). Outside of that environment, it’s likely that you won’t have the structure, (positive) peer pressure, and resources available in the academic classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn math outside of school, I’d recommend study groups or lunch and learn seminars as great resources for committed study. In research labs, this might come in the form of a reading group. Structure-wise, your group might walk through textbook chapters and discuss lectures on a regular basis while dedicating a Slack channel to asynchronous Q&amp;amp;A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Culture plays a large role here — this kind of “additional” study should be encouraged and incentivized by management so that it doesn’t feel like it takes away from day-to-day deliverables. In fact, investing in peer-driven learning environments can make your long-term work more effective, despite short-term costs in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Math and Code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Math and code are highly intertwined in machine learning workflows. Code is often built directly from mathematical intuition, and it even shares the syntax of mathematical notation. In fact, modern data science frameworks (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.numpy.org/&quot;&gt;NumPy&lt;/a&gt;) make it intuitive and efficient to translate mathematical operations (e.g. matrix/vector products) to readable code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to embrace code as a way to solidify your learning. Both math and code depend on precision in understanding and notation. For instance, practicing the manual implementation of loss functions or optimization algorithms can be a great way to truly understanding the underlying concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example of learning math through code, let’s consider a practical example: implementing backpropagation for the ReLU activation in your neural network (&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@karpathy/yes-you-should-understand-backprop-e2f06eab496b&quot;&gt;yes, even if Tensorflow/PyTorch can do this for you!&lt;/a&gt;). As a brief primer, backpropagation is a technique that relies on the chain rule from calculus to efficiently compute gradients. To utilize the chain rule in this setting, we multiply upstream derivatives by the gradient of ReLU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin, we visualize the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_%28neural_networks%29&quot;&gt;ReLU&lt;/a&gt; activation, defined:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Math-for-ML-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Math-for-ML-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Math for ML 1&quot; width=&quot;377&quot; height=&quot;286&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1102706&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Math-for-ML-1.png 377w, https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Math-for-ML-1-300x228.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 377px) 100vw, 377px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compute the gradient (intuitively, the slope), you might visualize a piecewise function, denoted by the indicator function as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Math-for-ML-2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Math-for-ML-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Math for ML 2&quot; width=&quot;372&quot; height=&quot;290&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1102708&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Math-for-ML-2.png 372w, https://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Math-for-ML-2-300x234.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 372px) 100vw, 372px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NumPy lends us helpful, intuitive syntax here— our activation function (blue curve) is interpretable in code, where x is our input and relu is our output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;relu = np.maximum(x, 0)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gradient (red curve) follows, where grad describes the upstream gradient:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;grad[x &amp;lt; 0] = 0
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without first deriving the gradient yourself, this line of code might not be self-explanatory. In our line of code, set set all values in the upstream gradient &lt;code&gt;(grad)&lt;/code&gt; to 0 for all elements that satisfy the condition, &lt;code&gt;[h&amp;lt;0]&lt;/code&gt;. Mathematically, this is effectively equivalent to the piecewise-representation of ReLU’s gradient, which squashes all values less than 0 to 0 when multiplying by an upstream gradient!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we see here, walking through our basic understanding of calculus gives us a clear way to think through the code. The full example of this neural network implementation can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/pytorch_with_examples.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Math for Building Machine Learning Products&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To inform this section, I spoke to machine learning engineers to figure out where math was most helpful in debugging their systems. The following are examples of questions that engineers found themselves answering with mathematical insights. If you haven’t seen them, no worries— the hope is that this section will provide some context into specific kinds of questions you might find yourself answering!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What clustering method should I use to visualize my high-dimensional customer data?&lt;br/&gt;○ Approach: &lt;a href=&quot;https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/238538/are-there-cases-where-pca-is-more-suitable-than-t-sne&quot;&gt;PCA vs. tSNE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How should I calibrate a threshold (e.g. confidence-level 0.9 vs. 0.8?) for “blocking” fraudulent user transactions?&lt;br/&gt;○ Approach: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/calibration.html&quot;&gt;Probability calibration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s the best way to characterize the bias of my satellite data to specific regions of the world (Silicon Valley vs. Alaska)?&lt;br/&gt;○ Approach: Open research question. Perhaps, aim for demographic &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.mrtz.org/2016/09/06/approaching-fairness.html&quot;&gt;parity&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, statistics and linear algebra can be employed in some way for each of these questions. However, to arrive at satisfactory answers often requires a domain-specific approach. If that’s the case, how do you narrow down the kind of math you need to learn?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define Your System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no shortage of resources (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scikit-learn.org/stable/&quot;&gt;scikit-learn&lt;/a&gt; for data analysis, &lt;a href=&quot;https://keras.io/&quot;&gt;keras&lt;/a&gt; for deep learning) that will help you jump into writing code to model your systems. In doing so, try to answer the following questions about the pipeline you need to build:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the inputs/outputs of your system?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How should you prepare your data to fit your system?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you construct features or curate data to help your model generalize?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you define a reasonable objective for your problem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’d be surprised — defining your system can be hard! Afterwards, the engineering required for pipeline-building is also non-trivial. In other words, building machine learning products requires significant amounts of heavy lifting that don’t require a deep mathematical background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;• &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml/&quot;&gt;Best Practices for ML Engineering&lt;/a&gt; by Martin Zinkevich, Research Scientist at Google&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning Math as You Need It&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diving headfirst into a machine learning workflow, you might find that there are some steps that you get stuck at, especially while debugging. When you’re stuck, do you know what to look up? How reasonable are your weights? Why isn’t your model converging with a particular loss definition? What’s the right way to measure success? At this point, it may be helpful to make assumptions about the data, constrain your optimization differently, or try different algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, you’ll find that there’s mathematical intuition baked into the modeling/debugging process (e.g. selecting loss functions or evaluation metrics) that could be instrumental to making informed, engineering decisions. These are your opportunities to learn!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rachel Thomas from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fast.ai/&quot;&gt;Fast.ai&lt;/a&gt; is a proponent of this “on-demand” method — while educating students, she found that it was more important for her deep learning students to get far enough to become excited about the material. Afterwards, their math education involved filling in the holes, on-demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;• Course: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fast.ai/2017/07/17/num-lin-alg/&quot;&gt;Computational Linear Algebra&lt;/a&gt; by fast.ai&lt;br/&gt;• YouTube: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw&quot;&gt;3blue1brown&lt;/a&gt;: Essence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&amp;amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&quot;&gt;Linear Algebra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM&amp;amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr&quot;&gt;Calculus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;• Textbook: &lt;a href=&quot;http://linear.axler.net/&quot;&gt;Linear Algebra Done Right&lt;/a&gt; by Axler&lt;br/&gt;• Textbook: &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/&quot;&gt;Elements of Statistical Learning&lt;/a&gt; by Tibshirani et al.&lt;br/&gt;• Course: &lt;a href=&quot;http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus.html#opt&quot;&gt;Stanford’s CS229 (Machine Learning) Course Notes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Math for Machine Learning Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now want to characterize the type of mathematical mindset that is useful for research-oriented work in machine learning. The cynical view of machine learning research points to plug-and-play systems where more compute is thrown at models to squeeze out higher performance. In some circles, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1801/1801.00631.pdf&quot;&gt;researchers remain skeptical&lt;/a&gt; that empirical methods lacking in mathematical rigor (e.g. certain deep learning methods) can carry us to the holy grail of human-level intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s concerning that the research world might be building on existing systems and assumptions that don’t extend our fundamental understanding of the field. Researchers need to contribute primitives— new, foundational building blocks that can be used to derive entirely new insights and approaches to goals in the field. For instance, this might mean rethinking building blocks like Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification, as Geoff Hinton, “the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton&quot;&gt;Godfather&lt;/a&gt; of Deep Learning,” does in his recent Capsule Networks &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09829v1.pdf&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the next leaps in machine learning, we need to ask fundamental questions. This requires a deep mathematical maturity, which Michael Nielsen, author of the Deep Learning book, described to me as “playful exploration.” This process involves thousands of hours of being “stuck”, asking questions, and flipping problems over in pursuit of new perspectives. “Playful exploration” allows scientists to ask deep, insightful questions, beyond the combination of straightforward ideas/architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To state the obvious— in ML research, it is still impossible to learn &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;! To properly engage in “playful exploration” requires that you follow your interest, rather than worrying about the hottest new result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ML research is an incredibly rich field of study with pressing problems in fairness, interpretability, and accessibility. As true across all scientific disciplines, fundamental thinking is not an on-demand process— it takes patience to be able to think with the breadth of high-level mathematical frameworks required for critical problem solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;• Blog: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/devlin_10_00.html&quot;&gt;Do SWEs need mathematics?&lt;/a&gt; by Keith Devlin&lt;br/&gt;• Reddit Thread: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/73n9pm/d_confession_as_an_ai_researcher_seeking_advice/&quot;&gt;Confessions of an AI Researcher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;• Blog: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.people.vcu.edu/~dcranston/490/handouts/math-read.html&quot;&gt;How to Read Mathematics&lt;/a&gt; by Shai Simonson and Fernando Gouvea&lt;br/&gt;• Papers: &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.nips.cc/book/advances-in-neural-information-processing-systems-30-2017&quot;&gt;NIPS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/&quot;&gt;ICML&lt;/a&gt; recent conference papers&lt;br/&gt;• Essay: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf&quot;&gt;A Mathematician’s Lament&lt;/a&gt; by Paul Lockhart&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Democratizing Machine Learning Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I hope that I haven’t painted “research math” as too esoteric, because the ideas formulated using math should be presented in intuitive forms! Sadly, many machine learning papers are still &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03341&quot;&gt;rife with complex and inconsistent terminology&lt;/a&gt;, leaving key intuition difficult to discern. As a student, you can do yourself and the field a great service by attempting to translate dense papers into consumable chunks of intuition, via blog posts, tweets, etc. You might even take examples from &lt;a href=&quot;http://distill.pub&quot;&gt;distill.pub&lt;/a&gt; as an example of a publication focused on offering clear explanations of machine learning research. In other words, take the demystification of technical ideas as a means towards “playful exploration”— your learning (and machine learning Twitter) will thank you for it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I hope that I’ve provided a starting point for you to think about your math education for machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Different problems require different levels of intuition, and I would encourage you to figure out what your objectives are in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re hoping to build products, seek peers and study groups through problems and motivate your learning by diving into the end-goal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the research world, broad mathematical foundations can give you the tools to push the field forward by contributing new, fundamental building blocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In general, math (especially in research paper form) can be intimidating, but getting stuck is a huge part of the learning process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A rather pointed criticism about math education that details “playful exploration.” But I suspect that Lockhart would disagree with the thesis of this post — that math should be used for anything &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; fun!.&lt;a href=&quot;http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-prob.pdf&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Removed &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;BCryptPasswordHasher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; from the default &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;PASSWORD_HASHERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; setting&lt;a class=&quot;headerlink&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/releases/2.1/#removed-bcryptpasswordhasher-from-the-default-password-hashers-setting&quot; title=&quot;Permalink to this headline&quot;&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you used bcrypt with Django 1.4 or 1.5 (before &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;BCryptSHA256PasswordHasher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; was added in Django 1.6), you might have some passwords that use the &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;BCryptPasswordHasher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; hasher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check if that’s the case like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight-default notranslate&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;django.contrib.auth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;get_user_model&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;get_user_model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;objects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;password__startswith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'bcrypt$$'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to continue to allow those passwords to be used, you’ll have to define the &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/settings/#std:setting-PASSWORD_HASHERS&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;xref std std-setting docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;PASSWORD_HASHERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; setting (if you don’t already) and include &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;'django.contrib.auth.hashers.BCryptPasswordHasher'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix the lack of &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; when using &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;RadioSelect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;CheckboxSelectMultiple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;MultiWidget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;wrap_label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; context variable now appears as an attribute of each option. For example, in a custom &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;input_option.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; template, change &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;wrap_label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;widget.wrap_label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the new “view” permission, existing custom admin forms may raise errors when a user doesn’t have the change permission because the form might access nonexistent fields.

<title>Google Refuses to Remove the Pirate Bay&amp;#039;s Homepage</title>
<link>https://torrentfreak.com/google-categorically-refuses-to-remove-the-pirate-bays-homepage-180729/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://torrentfreak.com/google-categorically-refuses-to-remove-the-pirate-bays-homepage-180729/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/googlepiratebay.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;267&quot; height=&quot;257&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-128445&quot;/&gt;In recent years, Google has had to process an incredible number of takedown requests, aimed at ‘pirate’ sites in search results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most of these notices do indeed list links to copyright-infringing content, not all are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are the obvious errors, where Wikipedia, Justice.gov, or NASA are targeted, for example. But even sites with a clear pirate stigma have pages that are not directly infringing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take The Pirate Bay’s homepage, which contains the iconic pirate ship logo, a search box, as well as some other links. However, there is no direct mention of copyright-infringing content that warrants a ‘takedown.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t prevent copyright holders and various reporting agencies from trying to remove it from Google though. Data provided by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lumendatabase.org/&quot;&gt;Lumen team&lt;/a&gt;, which maintains an archive of all the DMCA notices Google search receives, shows that Pirate Bay’s homepage has been targeted dozens of times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year alone, at least 15 separate takedown notices ask Google to remove ThePirateBay.org from its index. Most of these are sent by the reporting agency Digimarc, on behalf of book publishers such as Penguin Random House, Kensington Publishing, and Recorded Books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent was sent just a &lt;a href=&quot;https://lumendatabase.org/notices/82420&quot;&gt;few days ago&lt;/a&gt;, accusing TPB’s homepage of hosting or linking to an infringing copy of “Star Wars: The Original Radio Drama.” A few days earlier a &lt;a href=&quot;https://lumendatabase.org/notices/16831653&quot;&gt;similar notice&lt;/a&gt; accused the same page of linking to the French version of Stephen King’s The Running Man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These notices also list other totally unrelated links which are hard to explain, as the image below shows. However, we won’t dwell on that here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the takedown attempts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/tpbdown.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;542&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-158757&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, The Pirate Bay’s homepage has been targeted more than 70 times. And even then we’re only counting the official domain names, ThePirateBay.org and ThePirateBay.se.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oldest &lt;a href=&quot;https://lumendatabase.org/notices/82420&quot;&gt;public notice&lt;/a&gt; we could find was sent by the American sports promotion company Zuffa. In January 2013 the company identified several infringing Pirate Bay links, but also added in the site’s homepage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there’s no shortage of reports, TPB’s homepage is still in Google’s index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since TPB’s homepage is not infringing, Google categorically refuses to remove it from its search results. While the site itself has been downranked, due to the high number of takedown requests Google receives for it, ThePirateBay.org remains listed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google did remove The Pirate Bay’s homepage in the past, by accident, but that was swiftly corrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Google received a (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) take-down request that erroneously listed Thepiratebay.org, and as a result, this URL was accidentally removed from the Google search index,” Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/google-removes-pirate-bay-frontpage-from-search-results-091002/&quot;&gt;said at the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are now correcting the removal, and you can expect to see Thepiratebay.org back in Google search results this afternoon,” the company added.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Google Categorically Refuses to Remove The Pirate Bay's Homepage - TorrentFreak</og:title>
<og:description>It's hard to spot consistent trends in the mass influx of DMCA takedown notices Google receives. One thing is pretty clear though, the search engine consistently refuses to remove The Pirate Bay's homepage from its index. This, despite dozens of attempts from a wide variety of copyright holders over the years.</og:description>

<title>How LeBron James&amp;#039; new public school is the first of its kind</title>
<link>https://www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/2018/7/31/17634370/lebron-james-school-akron-i-promise-different</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/2018/7/31/17634370/lebron-james-school-akron-i-promise-different</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Akron’s public schools have a major problem; its at-risk students &lt;a href=&quot;http://bireports.education.ohio.gov/Microstrategy/asp/Main.aspx?evt=2048001&amp;amp;documentID=93E59197428D9265383EB8A8DE95D1DE&amp;amp;elementsPromptAnswers=50C135904A900677342F92A91D6A8612;50C135904A900677342F92A91D6A8612%3A043489&amp;amp;hiddensections=header,path,dockTop,dockLeft,footer,links&amp;amp;visMode=0&quot;&gt;are falling well behind the rest of the K-12 population&lt;/a&gt; in the classroom. The question the district faces now is whether &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/296663/lebron-james&quot;&gt;LeBron James&lt;/a&gt; can fix that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/7/30/17629560/lebron-james-i-promise-school-akron&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Promise School&lt;/em&gt; opened Monday&lt;/a&gt; to serve low-income and at-risk students in his hometown, and the public school could be an agent of change in the eastern Ohio city. The institution is the intersection of James’ philanthropic Family Foundation and the &lt;em&gt;I Promise Network&lt;/em&gt; he helped kickstart. &lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; began as an Akron-based non-profit &lt;a href=&quot;http://lebronjamesfamilyfoundation.org/page/akronipromise&quot;&gt;aimed at boosting achievement for younger students from disadvantaged backgrounds&lt;/a&gt;. Now the movement has the means to educate these students year-round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are aspects of James’ school that are wholly unique. There are others that build on a tested network of educational reforms. Here’s why the &lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;School&lt;/em&gt; stands out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; is building from a model that’s shown success&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ohio.com/akron/news/education/i-promise-school-aims-to-educate-the-whole-child-and-their-families-too&quot;&gt;will feature longer school days&lt;/a&gt;, a non-traditional school year, and greater access to the school, its facilities, and its teachers during down time for students. That’s a formula aimed at replicating some of the at-home support children may be missing when it comes to schoolwork. The school has also anchored its curriculum in math and science-based teaching, dipping into the STEM — science, technology, engineering, and math — curriculum that prepares students for the jobs of the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This interweaving of community-building and future-focused learning isn’t new and has succeeded at other innovative schools across the country.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Several reform-minded schools have carved similar paths for &lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; to follow. The Knowledge is Power Program, better known as KIPP, has created the nation’s largest network of charter schools by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kipp.org/approach/&quot;&gt;catering to marginalized students with longer class hours, increasing access to teachers, and a tough but accommodating schedule for students&lt;/a&gt;. Rocketship Public Schools, another non-profit charter program with schools in California, Wisconsin, Tennessee, and Washington D.C., operates with a similarly non-traditional classroom. Rocketship emphasizes a STEM-based curriculum &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rocketshipschools.org/about/our-mission-and-model/&quot;&gt;while bringing a student’s home life into the classroom and continuing learning outside regular class hours&lt;/a&gt;. Both take aim at reducing the achievement gap between low-income students and their peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s still early, but reports from &lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; suggest the school will address Akron’s achievement gap by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ohio.com/akron/news/education/i-promise-school-aims-to-educate-the-whole-child-and-their-families-too&quot;&gt;running similar reforms&lt;/a&gt; as other successful national programs. It does not go as far as KIPP or Rocketship in those charges, but it’s clear &lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; is designed to operate at a level beyond the typical public school by creating a more comprehensive experience for students, not just one that begins at 7 a.m. and ends at 2 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; is a regular public school, not a charter or a voucher-receiving private school&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of wide reform is rare to see at a traditional neighborhood school. KIPP and Rocketship schools have been successful in larger cities across the nation, but typically operate outside the purview of their local school boards as charter schools. Several private schools, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.jsonline.com/news/education/henry-tyson-charted-unlikely-path-to-milwaukee-education-debates-b99336115z1-272631521.html&quot;&gt;Milwaukee’s St. Marcus Lutheran Schools&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gesuschool.org/&quot;&gt;Philadelphia’s Gesu School&lt;/a&gt;, have instituted reforms like these while enrolling students using publicly-funded vouchers or tax-credit scholarships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; is neither. As far as Akron’s records are concerned, it’s another neighborhood public school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That shows how badly James wanted his school to be a no-exceptions public school. &lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; could have helped students as a charter school with less local oversight and still served its community. It could have been a private school that enrolled Akron’s underserved students at no cost to them through the state’s low-income voucher program. In either case, the school would have operated as a separate entity from the school system in which James grew up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, &lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; is a full-fledged part of Akron Public Schools, the 29th elementary school in the district. This helps keep the institution inclusive to its local student body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also raises questions about funding. Per the state of Ohio, Akron’s schools &lt;a href=&quot;http://reportcard.education.ohio.gov/Pages/District-Report.aspx?DistrictIRN=043489&quot;&gt;were given just $10,028 in state and local funds per student&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 — more than the statewide average, but still a relatively low figure for a city of a little under 200,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not a lot of money to operate a school with such grand aspirations, which is where the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/296677/lebron-james&quot;&gt;LeBron James&lt;/a&gt; Family Foundation comes in. James’ nonprofit is the leader of a group of more than 120 donors, volunteers, and sponsors working to find the resources needed to keep exceptional educators on staff through a more demanding teaching schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; is a public school, that group also must have worked with Akron’s local teachers’ union to create a plan with which the coalition of teachers could agree. A quick look at the benefits available to those staffers shows the steps James and his cohort are making to attract and retain quality educators. From &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/la-sp-lakers-lebron-james-i-promise-20180729-htmlstory.html&quot;&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;’ profile on the school&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To truly provide emotional and psychological services for at-risk children and their families requires well-trained and supported teachers. The &lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; School gives teachers access to psychological services. Every Wednesday afternoon will be reserved for career development. James even hired a personal trainer to work with teachers who want a guided workout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All their supplies also are provided by the school. That was a pleasant surprise for Angela Whorton, an intervention specialist at the &lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; School. She’s been a teacher for 10 years and almost always had to spend her own money to properly stock the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten thousand dollars per student can’t cover those services, but the buy-in from the LeBron James Family Foundation can. That will make &lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; a destination for ambitious teachers in 2018 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; is starting in the middle and expanding outward&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school opened Monday with 240 students spread over two grades — third and fourth. From there, it will add second and fifth grades in 2019 and then expand to a first through eighth grade lineup (there are no current plans to offer kindergarten) by 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not unusual for new schools to start small and add grades over time. Most start at the beginning with a K-2 or K-3 lineup that introduces students to not only their school and curricula, but also to elementary education as a whole. From there, these institutions typically tack on their later grades year-by-year to accommodate matriculating students and ensure full coverage through the end of eighth or 12th grade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting at third grade is an interesting place to begin. It’s a logical extension of the &lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; Network, the foundation that laid the framework for the school by offering after-school and summer programing for more than 1,200 students in the city beginning after second grade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will create some challenges, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Promise School&lt;/em&gt; will be getting pupils who have spent their first three or four years in schools Ohio &lt;a href=&quot;http://reportcard.education.ohio.gov/Pages/District-Report.aspx?DistrictIRN=043489&quot;&gt;has given an “F” grade for student progress&lt;/a&gt;. Those first four years of early development are paramount to a child’s future success. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.educationcorner.com/learning-to-read-to-read-to-learn.html&quot;&gt;an oft-cited education adage goes&lt;/a&gt;; “before grade three, you’re learning to read. After grade three, you’re reading to learn.” State data suggests Akron’s students as a whole &lt;a href=&quot;http://reportcard.education.ohio.gov/Pages/District-Report.aspx?DistrictIRN=043489&quot;&gt;demonstrate below-average literacy skills as K-3 students&lt;/a&gt;. This threatens to create lapses in the early stages of of the new school as teachers struggle to accelerate student growth to meet &lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt;’s standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are safeguards in place to address this problem and boost these students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt; is going above and beyond to address the non-academic issues that affect classroom performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of &lt;em&gt;I Promise&lt;/em&gt;’s key tenets is building connections to its students and its community. Creating a comfortable home life is one of the school’s core beliefs, and it stretches beyond just the student. Parents can use the institution’s job and family services, study through its GED program, or design meals at the on-site food bank to cook at home. There are also counselors on staff to help children deal with the trauma that may arise in their daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think the missing link in public education is that family wraparound support,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/la-sp-lakers-lebron-james-i-promise-20180729-story.html&quot;&gt;said Brandi Davis, the school’s principal&lt;/a&gt;. “Because our students come to school and they’re worried about things at home. … We want to create that safe, that secure and that caring and loving environment for our families and our students so that our kids can focus on education.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These students will each receive a bicycle on their first day of class as well — the tool James used to escape dangerous parts of Akron and explore his neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;p-entry-hr&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last December, James &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ohio.com/akron/news/education/i-promise-school-aims-to-educate-the-whole-child-and-their-families-too&quot;&gt;laid the mission for his school out to Theresa Cottom of the Akron Beacon-Journal&lt;/a&gt;, painting a broad strokes explanation of why his school would be different. link&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to be on ’em like a school should be because we want them to be successful not only in the school, but successful in life,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ohio.com/akron/news/education/i-promise-school-aims-to-educate-the-whole-child-and-their-families-too&quot;&gt;James said&lt;/a&gt;. “We’re gonna give ’em everything that they need and give them criteria that they all can meet, depending on the individual. But it’s going to be pretty cool to see the kids at the school the first day we open.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now he’s seen it come to life, and he’s right. It was pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>My Own Car System, Rear Camera, Offline Maps and Routing with Go</title>
<link>https://blog.nobugware.com/post/2018/my_own_car_system_raspberry_pi_offline_mapping_map_matching_places_part2/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.nobugware.com/post/2018/my_own_car_system_raspberry_pi_offline_mapping_map_matching_places_part2/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This is my journey building an open source car system with Go &amp;amp; Qt, rear camera, live OpenGL map …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cross-compilation&quot;&gt;Cross compilation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.nobugware.com/post/2018/my_own_car_system_raspberry_pi_offline_mapping/&quot;&gt;In Part I&lt;/a&gt;, I had to patch qtmultimedia for the camera to work, but Qt compilation is ressource hungry, same goes for the osrm compilation, the memory of the Raspberry Pi is too small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to to set up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Distcc#Arch_Linux_ARM&quot;&gt;cross compilation system&lt;/a&gt; in my case for armv7h.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;qml-development&quot;&gt;QML Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since most of the application is in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QML&quot;&gt;QML&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve used the c++ &lt;code&gt;main.cpp&lt;/code&gt; launcher as long as possible for the development.&lt;br/&gt;At the moment I needed to inject data from the outside world (like the GPS location) to QML via Qt, so I switched to Go using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/therecipe/qt&quot;&gt;therecipe Qt Go bindings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Go bindings project is young but the main author is really active fixing issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes desktop applications easy to code without the assle of C++ (at least for me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About QML, by separating the logic and forms using &lt;code&gt;.qml.ui&lt;/code&gt; you still can edit your views with &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_Creator&quot;&gt;Qt Creator&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;That’s just the narrative, truth is Creator is really buggy and I edited the ui files by hand most of the time.&lt;br/&gt;I worked with Interface Builder on iOS for years, Qt is painful, lack of decent visual editor for QML really hurts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;serving-the-map-without-internet-access&quot;&gt;Serving the map without internet access&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.nobugware.com/post/2018/my_own_car_system_raspberry_pi_offline_mapping/&quot;&gt;In Part I&lt;/a&gt;, we talked about OpenMapTiles and OpenGL rendering, but I needed a web server capable of reading MBTiles format and serving the necessary assets for the map to be rendered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve created &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/akhenakh/mbmatch&quot;&gt;mbmatch&lt;/a&gt; in Go for that purpose so &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/akhenakh/mocs&quot;&gt;mocs&lt;/a&gt; can render the map without Internet access, it will also map match the positions in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;experimenting-with-another-touch-screen&quot;&gt;Experimenting with another touch screen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m using a less performant but smaller &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01I9DS2G8&quot;&gt;LANDZO 5 Inch Touch Display&lt;/a&gt; 800x480&lt;br/&gt;This touchscreen is handled as a one button mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be calibrate using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kergoth/tslib/&quot;&gt;tslib&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;ts_calibrate&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in your start env tell Qt to use tslib.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;TSLIB_TSDEVICE=/dev/input/event0
QT_QPA_GENERIC_PLUGINS=tslib:/dev/input/event0
QT_QPA_FB_TSLIB=1
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;gps&quot;&gt;GPS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said in &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.nobugware.com/post/2018/my_own_car_system_raspberry_pi_offline_mapping/&quot;&gt;part I&lt;/a&gt;, the Linux gps daemons are using obscure and over complicated protocols so &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/927/&quot;&gt;I’ve decided&lt;/a&gt; to write my own gps daemon in Go using a gRPC stream interface. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/akhenakh/gpsd&quot;&gt;find it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also not satisfied with the map matching of OSRM for real time display, I may rewrite one using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/akhenakh/mbmatch&quot;&gt;mbmatch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;pois&quot;&gt;POIs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve started POIs lookups with full text search and geo proximity using &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/blevesearch/bleve&quot;&gt;bleve&lt;/a&gt; by exposing an API compatible with the OSM API so it can be used directly by QML Locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;night-map&quot;&gt;Night Map&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a huge fan of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/altercation/solarized&quot;&gt;Solarized colors&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve made a style for the map you can find it &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/akhenakh/mocs/blob/master/external/solarized-dark.style&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.nobugware.com/img/mocssolarized.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Solarized&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;speeding-up-boot&quot;&gt;Speeding up boot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;systemctl mask systemd-udev-settle.service
systemctl mask lvm2-activation-net.service
systemctl mask lvm2-monitor.service
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;status&quot;&gt;Status&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is far from finished and not ready for everybody but it’s fun to play with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/akhenakh/mocs&quot;&gt;open sourced most of the code for Mocs on github&lt;/a&gt;, feel free to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google Plans to Launch Censored Search Engine in China, Leaked Documents Reveal</title>
<link>https://theintercept.com/2018/08/01/google-china-search-engine-censorship/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://theintercept.com/2018/08/01/google-china-search-engine-censorship/</guid>
<description>&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;193&quot; readability=&quot;192.45523336414&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google is planning&lt;/u&gt; to launch a censored version of its search engine in China that will blacklist websites and search terms about human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest, The Intercept can reveal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project – code-named Dragonfly – has been underway since spring of last year, and accelerated following a December 2017 meeting between Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai and a top Chinese government official, according to internal Google documents and people familiar with the plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teams of programmers and engineers at Google have created a custom Android app, different versions of which have been named “Maotai” and “Longfei.” The app has already been demonstrated to the Chinese government; the finalized version could be launched in the next six to nine months, pending approval from Chinese officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planned move represents a dramatic shift in Google’s policy on China and will mark the first time in almost a decade that the internet giant has operated its search engine in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s search service cannot currently be accessed by most internet users in China because it is blocked by the country’s so-called Great Firewall. The app Google is building for China will comply with the country’s strict censorship laws, restricting access to content that Xi Jinping’s Communist Party regime deems unfavorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;stylized pull-right&quot; data-shortcode-type=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-pull=&quot;right&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search app will “blacklist sensitive queries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government blocks information on the internet about political opponents, free speech, sex, news, and academic studies. It bans websites about the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, for instance, and references to “anticommunism” and “dissidents.” Mentions of books that negatively portray authoritarian governments, like George Orwell’s 1984 and Animal Farm, have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2018/02/sensitive-words-emperor-xi-jinping-ascend-throne/&quot;&gt;prohibited&lt;/a&gt; on Weibo, a Chinese social media website. The country also censors popular Western social media sites like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, as well as American news organizations such as the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documents seen by The Intercept, marked “Google confidential,” say that Google’s Chinese search app will automatically identify and filter websites blocked by the Great Firewall. When a person carries out a search, banned websites will be removed from the first page of results, and a disclaimer will be displayed stating that “some results may have been removed due to statutory requirements.” Examples cited in the documents of websites that will be subject to the censorship include those of British news broadcaster BBC and the online encyclopedia Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search app will also “blacklist sensitive queries” so that “no results will be shown” at all when people enter certain words or phrases, the documents state. The censorship will apply across the platform: Google’s image search, automatic spell check and suggested search features will incorporate the blacklists, meaning that they will not recommend people information or photographs the government has banned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within Google, knowledge about Dragonfly has been restricted to just a few hundred members of the internet giant’s 88,000-strong workforce, said a source with knowledge of the project. The source spoke to The Intercept on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to contact the media. The source said that they had moral and ethical concerns about Google’s role in the censorship, which is being planned by a handful of top executives and managers at the company with no public scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;stylized pull-none&quot; data-shortcode-type=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-pull=&quot;none&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m against large companies and governments collaborating in the oppression of their people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m against large companies and governments collaborating in the oppression of their people, and feel like transparency around what’s being done is in the public interest,” the source said, adding that they feared “what is done in China will become a template for many other nations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Poon, a Hong Kong-based researcher with human rights group Amnesty International, told The Intercept that Google’s decision to comply with the censorship would be “a big disaster for the information age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This has very serious implications not just for China, but for all of us, for freedom of information and internet freedom,” said Poon. “It will set a terrible precedent for many other companies who are still trying to do business in China while maintaining the principles of not succumbing to China’s censorship. The biggest search engine in the world obeying the censorship in China is a victory for the Chinese government – it sends a signal that nobody will bother to challenge the censorship any more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unclear whether Google will eventually launch a desktop version of its censored China search platform. For now, the company is focused on initially rolling out the Android app, which a large portion of China’s population will be able to access. Researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emarketer.com/Article/More-than-95-of-Internet-Users-China-Use-Mobile-Devices-Go-Online/1015155&quot;&gt;estimate&lt;/a&gt; that more than 95 percent of people accessing the internet in China use mobile devices to go online, and Android is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/262176/market-share-held-by-mobile-operating-systems-in-china/&quot;&gt;by far&lt;/a&gt; the most popular mobile operating system in the country, with 80 percent of the market share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents seen by The Intercept suggest that Google will operate the search app as part of a “joint venture” with an unnamed partner company, which will presumably be based in China. However, much of the work on the Dragonfly project is being carried out at Google’s Mountain View headquarters in California, about 14 miles northwest of San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley. Other teams participating in the project are based out of Google offices in New York, San Francisco, Sunnyvale, Santa Barbara, Cambridge, Washington, D.C., Shanghai, Beijing, and Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Previously, between 2006&lt;/u&gt; and 2010, Google had maintained a censored version of its search engine in China. At the time, the company faced severe criticism in the U.S. over its compliance with the Chinese government’s policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a February 2006 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.c-span.org/video/?191220-1/internet-china&quot;&gt;congressional hearing&lt;/a&gt; that focused on the activities of American technology companies in China, members of the House International Relations Committee called Google a “functionary of the Chinese government” and accused it of “abhorrent actions” for participating in censorship. “Google has seriously compromised its ‘don’t be evil’ policy,” declared Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J. “Indeed, it has become evil’s accomplice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy eventually became too much for Google. In March 2010, it announced that it was pulling its search service out of China. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/new-approach-to-china-update.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; published at the time, the company cited Chinese government efforts to limit free speech, block websites, and hack Google computer systems as reasons why it “could no longer continue censoring our results.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sergey Brin, Google’s co-founder, was born in the Soviet Union and seemed particularly sensitive to concerns around censorship, having had personal experience under a repressive regime. After Google ceased its search service in 2010, Brin &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/7503641/Sergey-Brin-My-upbringing-in-USSR-helped-shape-Googles-views-on-China.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that the company’s objection related to “forces of totalitarianism,” and added that he hoped the decision to pull the search platform out of the country would help lead to a “more open internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;stylized pull-right&quot; data-shortcode-type=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-pull=&quot;right&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Companies operating in China must be prepared to turn over user data to security agencies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, however, censorship and surveillance in China has become more pervasive. In 2016, the country’s government passed a new cybersecurity law, which Human Rights Watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/11/06/china-abusive-cybersecurity-law-set-be-passed&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; “strengthens censorship, surveillance, and other controls over the internet.” The government is using new &lt;a href=&quot;https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/01/technology/china-wechat-censorship-ai/index.html?iid=EL&quot;&gt;automated systems&lt;/a&gt; to monitor and censor the internet, and it has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2064587/chinas-move-clean-vpns-and-strengthen-great-firewall&quot;&gt;cracked down&lt;/a&gt; on privacy technologies that Chinese people were using to circumvent the restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It has been a requirement that companies operating in China must be prepared to police their users and turn over user data to security agencies upon request,” said Ron Deibert, director of Citizen Lab, an internet research group based at the University of Toronto. “We have also found overall that internet censorship [in China] is evolving towards less transparency, with less notification to users when messages are censored or removed across all platforms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the continued repression, opinions have changed at the highest levels of Google. China now has more than 750 million internet users, equivalent to the entire population of Europe. It therefore represents a potentially massive revenue stream for the internet giant, which is likely a factor in its decision to relaunch the search platform in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;203&quot; readability=&quot;47.455259711916&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason for the planned policy reversal may be that since Google last operated its search tool in China, the company’s leadership structure has markedly changed. Co-founders Brin and Larry Page have adopted less hands-on roles, though they still serve on the company’s board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s China rapproachment has been spearheaded by Pichai, Google’s current CEO, a 46-year-old Indian-American who took the helm in October 2015. At a June 2016 conference in southern California, Pichai made his intentions clear. “I care about servicing users globally in every corner. Google is for everyone,” he said. “We want to be in China serving Chinese users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2017, sources say Pichai traveled to China and attended a private meeting with Wang Huning, a leading figure in the Communist Party. Huning is President Xi’s top foreign policy adviser and has been described as “China’s Kissinger.” Pichai is said to have viewed the meeting as a success. The same month, Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/13/business/google-ai-china.html&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it was launching an artificial intelligence research center in Beijing. That was followed in May 2018 with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/31/technology/google-in-china-files-app/&quot;&gt;release&lt;/a&gt; of a Google file management app for Chinese internet users. Then, in July, Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://download.cnet.com/blog/download-blog/google-ai-guesses-what-youre-drawing-in-a-mini-app-released-for-wechat-in-china/&quot;&gt;rolled out&lt;/a&gt; a “Guess The Sketch” game on WeChat, a popular Chinese messaging and social media platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finale would be the launch of the search app — the Dragonfly project. According to sources familiar with the plans, timing for the app’s release will depend on two main factors: approval from the Chinese government and confidence within Google that its app will be better than the search service offered by its main competitor in China, Baidu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google insiders say that it is not known when the company will obtain the approval from officials in Beijing because an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China has slowed the process. However, Google’s search engine chief Ben Gomes told staff at a meeting last month that they must be ready to launch the Chinese search app at short notice, in the event that “suddenly the world changes or [President Donald Trump] decides his new best friend is Xi Jinping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google and the Chinese government’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to multiple requests for comment on this story.&lt;/p&gt;

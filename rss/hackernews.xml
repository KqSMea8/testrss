<title>Firefox 57 delays requests to tracking domains</title>
<link>https://www.janbambas.cz/firefox-57-delays-requests-tracking-domains/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.janbambas.cz/firefox-57-delays-requests-tracking-domains/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Firefox Quantum – version 57 – introduced number of changes to the network requests scheduler.  One of them is using data of the Tracking Protection database to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1358060&quot;&gt;delay load of scripts from tracking domains&lt;/a&gt; when possible during the time a page is actively loading and rendering – I call it &lt;strong&gt;tailing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has a positive effect on page load performance as we save some of the network bandwidth, I/O and CPU for loading and processing of images and scripts running on the site so the web page is complete and ready sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracking scripts are not disabled, we only delay their load for few seconds when we can.  Scripts are delayed only when added dynamically or as async.  Tracking images are always delayed.  This is legal according all HTML specifications and it’s assumed that well built sites will not be affected regarding functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, sites that are either &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1423373&quot;&gt;not well built&lt;/a&gt; or their &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1420885&quot;&gt;rendering is influenced by scripts&lt;/a&gt; from tracking domains there can be a visible or even functional effect.  Simply said some sites may need to be fixed to be able to adopt this change in scheduling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example is &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/optimize/&quot;&gt;Google’s Page-Hiding Snippet&lt;/a&gt;, which may cause a web page to be blank for whole 4 seconds since the navigation start.  What happens?  Google’s A/B testing initially hides the whole web page with opacity: 0.  The test script first has to do its job to prepare the page for the test and only then it unhides the page content.  The test script is dynamically loaded by the analytics.js script.  Both the analytics.js and the test script are loaded from www.google-analytics.com, a tracking domain, for which we engage the tailing delay.  As the result the page is blank until one of the following wins: 4 seconds timeout elapses or we load both the scripts and execute them.  For a common user this appears as a performance drawback and not a win.  One possible solution may be to self-host the scripts so they are not recognized as trackers, but this is more work for web administrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other example can be a web page referring an API of an async tracking script from a sync script, which obviously is a race condition, since there is no guarantee that an async script loads before a sync script.  There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/match/422947&quot;&gt;real life example&lt;/a&gt; of such not-well-built site using a Twitter API – window.twttr.  The twttr object is simply not there when the site’s script calls on it.  An exception is thrown and the rest of the site script is not executed breaking some of the page’s functionality.  That effected web page worked before tailing just because Twitter’s servers were fast to respond and executed sooner than the site script using the window.twttr object.  Hence, worked only by a lucky accident.  Note that sites with such race condition issues are 100% broken also when opened in Private Browsing windows or when Tracking Protection with just the default list is turned on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude on how useful the tailing feature is – unfortunately, at the moment I don’t have enough data to provide (it’s on its way, though.)  So far testing was made mostly locally and on our Web Page Test internal testing infrastructure.  The effect was unfortunately just hidden in the overall noise, hence more scientific and wide testing needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Thunder 57 “Photon” Visual Refresh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2306&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Thunderbird is going strong at version 52 (ESR) and 57, 58 beta&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;582f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;In April 2017 Thunderbird released its successful Extended Service Release (ESR) version 52. This release has just seen it’s fifth “dot update” 52.5.0, where fixes, stability and minor functionality improvements were shipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b373&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Thunderbird 57 beta was also very successful. While Thunderbird 58 is equally stable and offers further cutting-edge improvements to Thunderbird users, the user community is starting to feel the impact of Mozilla platform changes which are phasing out so-called legacy add-ons. The Thunderbird technical leadership is working closely with add-on authors who face the challenge of updating their add-ons to work with the Mozilla interface changes. With a few usually simple changes most add-ons can be made to work in Thunderbird 58 beta. &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird/Add-ons_Guide_57&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; data-href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird/Add-ons_Guide_57&quot;&gt;https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird/Add-ons_Guide_57&lt;/a&gt; explains what needs to be done, and Thunderbird developers are happy to lend a hand to add-on authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;e612&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;There has been some discussion about the modernisation of Thunderbird’s user interface. Thunderbird 57 is now following Mozilla’s Photon design, and there is also a new theme available based on the design by the Monterail team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8164&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;You can download the &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/channel/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/channel/&quot;&gt;current Thunderbird beta here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;17e2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf--leading&quot;&gt;New Staff at Thunderbird&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fc09&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Since November 2016 the Thunderbird project has contracted the services of long-time Thunderbird volunteer contributor Jörg Knobloch. Since Jörg moved from being a volunteer to being a contractor, his focus has changed from chasing his favourite pet-hate bugs to taking on responsibility for the product. As the continuous integration engineer, he guarantees that Thunderbird Daily is always in sync with Mozilla core changes to keep Daily in a working order. Jörg manages all code for releases (beta and ESR) and monitors regressions as reported at BMO. As a Thunderbird and Mailnews peer he reviews the work of others and is part of the Engineering Steering Committee which is in charge of the code base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;d33f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In March 2017 Andrei Hajdukewycz joined the project. Andrei is the project’s infrastructure engineer. He’s been working on transitioning the project from using Mozilla infrastructure to procuring its own. He administers all the websites used by the project. There are many: Thunderbird.net*), the ISPDB, websites for telemetry, updates and release notes. And last not least: Add-ons. Soon Thunderbird add-ons will transition to Thunderbird’s own add-ons site. Watch this space!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2f69&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In June 2017 Tom Prince joined the project as a build and release engineer. He makes sure that we can always build Daily, beta and ESR in en-US English and all localisations. He also helps out when diagnosing test and other miscellaneous failures. Most recently Tom has been migrating the Thunderbird build system from Buildbot to TaskCluster to future-proof this aspect of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;738f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The project’s last hire in December 2017 has been Ryan Sipes (the guy posting this) as Community Manager. His task is to organise the community of voluntary contributors including add-on authors, spread the good news about Thunderbird, engage with donors to guarantee a solid income stream and be in touch with Thunderbird users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1625&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;These four staff members are just the beginning. The project is currently in the process of hiring developers to address some technical debt, fix some sore points in the software and transition the codebase from a mix of C++, JavaScript, XUL and XPCOM to be increasingly based on web technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bfc0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;The Thunderbird project has taken control of the Thunderbird.net domain, of which the project will make increasing use. The &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://www.thunderbird.net&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.thunderbird.net&quot;&gt;www.thunderbird.net&lt;/a&gt; domain is being updated to be more helpful to users and eventually become Thunderbird’s home on the web. The in-product Thunderbird start page has already been served via this domain for several months. And, the members of the Thunderbird Council have received email accounts @ thunderbird.net, powered by Fastmail, a gift that we are very grateful for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

<title>WhatsApp told to stop sharing user data with Facebook by French authorities</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-whatsapp-privacy-france/french-privacy-watchdog-raps-whatsapp-over-facebook-data-sharing-idUSKBN1EC285</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-whatsapp-privacy-france/french-privacy-watchdog-raps-whatsapp-over-facebook-data-sharing-idUSKBN1EC285</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - France’s data privacy watchdog may fine messaging app WhatsApp if it does not comply with an order to bring its sharing of user data with parent company Facebook into line with French privacy law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French data protection authority - CNIL - said on Monday it had told WhatsApp to comply with the order within one month, and pay particular attention to obtaining users’ consent. If WhatsApp does not comply it could sanction the company, it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CNIL said WhatsApp did not have the legal basis to share user data with Facebook and had violated its obligation to cooperate with the French authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WhatsApp, bought by Facebook in 2014, said it would begin sharing some user data with the social media group in 2016, drawing warnings from European privacy watchdogs about getting the appropriate consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October, European Union privacy regulators criticized WhatsApp for not resolving their concerns over the messaging service’s sharing of user data with Facebook a year after they first issued a warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French regulator said WhatsApp had not properly obtained users’ consent to begin sharing their phone numbers with Facebook for “business intelligence” purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The only way to refuse the data transfer for “business intelligence” purpose is to uninstall the application,” the CNIL said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator accepted the transfer of user data for security purposes seemed to be essential to the functioning of the application. But the watchdog also said the same did not apply for “business intelligence” purposes which aim to improve the apps’ performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Privacy is incredibly important to WhatsApp. It’s why we collect very little data, and encrypt every message,” a spokeswoman for WhatsApp said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will continue to work with the CNIL to ensure users understand what information we collect, as well as how it’s used. And we’re committed to resolving the different, and at times conflicting, concerns we’ve heard from European Data Protection Authorities with a common EU approach before the General Data Protection Regulation comes into force in May 2018.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European data protection authorities can only impose small fines at the moment, but a new EU privacy law entering into force next year will increase fines to up to 4 percent of a company’s global turnover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CNIL said it had repeatedly asked WhatsApp to provide a sample of French users’ data transferred to Facebook but the company had explained it could not do so as it is located in the United States and “it considers that it is only subject to the legislation of this country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Germany’s cartel office said on Tuesday it had found Facebook had abused its dominant market position, in a ruling that questioned the company’s model of monetizing the personal data of its users through targeted advertising.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>In Raising the World’s I.Q., the Secret’s in the Salt (2006)</title>
<link>http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/16/health/16iodine.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/16/health/16iodine.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;243&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1884&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;The most visible and severe effects — disabling goiters, cretinism and dwarfism — affect a tiny minority, usually in mountain villages. But 16 percent of the world’s people have at least mild goiter, a swollen thyroid gland in the neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;302&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2186&quot;&gt;“Find me a mother who wouldn’t pawn her last blouse to get iodine if she understood how it would affect her fetus,” said Jack C. S. Ling, chairman of the International Council for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders, a committee of about 350 scientists formed in 1985 to champion iodization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;346&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2532&quot;&gt;The 1990 World Summit for Children called for the elimination of iodine deficiency by 2000, and the subsequent effort was led by Professor Ling’s organization along with Unicef, the World Health Organization, Kiwanis International, the World Bank and the foreign aid agencies of Canada, Australia, the Netherlands, the United States and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;156&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2688&quot;&gt;Largely out of the public eye, they made terrific progress: 25 percent of the world’s households consumed iodized salt in 1990. Now, about 66 percent do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;167&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2855&quot;&gt;But the effort has been faltering lately. When victory was not achieved by 2005, donor interest began to flag as &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/aids/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&quot; title=&quot;Recent and archival health news about AIDS/HIV.&quot; class=&quot;meta-classifier&quot;&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/avianinfluenza/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&quot; title=&quot;Recent and archival health news about avian influenza.&quot; class=&quot;meta-classifier&quot;&gt;avian flu&lt;/a&gt; and other threats got more attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;209&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3064&quot;&gt;And, like all such drives, it cost more than expected. In 1990, the estimated price tag was $75 million — a bargain compared with, for example, the fight against &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/poliomyelitis/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&quot; title=&quot;Recent and archival health news about polio.&quot; class=&quot;meta-classifier&quot;&gt;polio&lt;/a&gt;, which has consumed about $4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;266&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3330&quot;&gt;Since then, according to David P. Haxton, the iodine council’s executive director, about $160 million has been spent, including $80 million from Kiwanis and $15 million from the Gates Foundation, along with unknown amounts spent on new equipment by salt companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;239&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3569&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;“Very often, I’ll talk to a salt producer at a meeting, and he’ll have no idea he had this power in his product,” Mr. Haxton said. “He’ll say ‘Why didn’t you tell me? Sure, I’ll do it. I would have done it sooner.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;269&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3838&quot;&gt;In many places, like Japan, people get iodine from seafood, seaweed, vegetables grown in iodine-rich soil or animals that eat grass grown in that soil. But even wealthy nations, including the United States and in Europe, still need to supplement that by iodizing salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;122&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3960&quot;&gt;The cheap part, experts say, is spraying on the iodine. The expense is always for the inevitable public relations battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;206&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4166&quot;&gt;In some nations, iodization becomes tarred as a government plot to poison an essential of life — salt experts compare it to the furious opposition by 1950s conservatives to fluoridation of American water.&lt;/p&gt;

Small salt makers who fear extra expense often lobby against it. So do makers of iodine pills who fear losing their market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;237&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4657&quot;&gt;Rumors inevitably swirl: iodine has been blamed for AIDS, &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/diabetes/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&quot; title=&quot;Recent and archival health news about diabetes.&quot; class=&quot;meta-classifier&quot;&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, seizures, impotence and peevishness. Iodized salt, according to different national rumor mills, will make pickled vegetables explode, ruin caviar or soften hard cheese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;64&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4721&quot;&gt;Breaking down that resistance takes both money and leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;184&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5242&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-5&quot;&gt;In the 1990s, when the campaign for iodization began, the world’s greatest concentration of iodine-deficient countries was in the landlocked former Soviet republics of Central Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;222&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5464&quot;&gt;All of them — Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrghzstan — saw their economies break down with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Across the region, only 28 percent of all households used iodized salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;179&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5643&quot;&gt;“With the collapse of the system, certain babies went out with the bathwater, and iodization was one of them,” said Alexandre Zouev, chief Unicef representative in Kazakhstan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;231&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5874&quot;&gt;Dr. Toregeldy Sharmanov, who was the Kazakh Republic’s health minister from 1971 to 1982, when it was in the Soviet Union, said the problem was serious even then. But he had been unable to fix it because policy was set in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;139&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6013&quot;&gt;“Kazakh children were stunted compared to the same-age Russian children,” he said. “But they paid no attention. It was a scandal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;311&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6324&quot;&gt;In 1996, Unicef, which focuses on the health of children, opened its first office in Kazakhstan and arranged for a survey of 5,000 households. It found that 10 percent of the children were stunted, opening the way for international aid. (Stunting can have many causes, but iodine deficiency is a prime culprit.)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;327&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6651&quot;&gt;In neighboring Turkmenistan, President Saparmurat Niyazov — a despot who requires all clocks to bear his likeness and renamed the days of the week after his family — solved the problem by simply declaring plain salt illegal in 1996 and ordering shops to give each citizen 11 pounds of iodized salt a year at state expense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;334&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6985&quot;&gt;In Kazakhstan, the democratic credentials of President Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, who has ruled since 1991, have come under criticism, but he does not rule by decree. “Those days are over,” said Ms. Sivryukova of the confederation of Kazakh charities. “Businesses are private now. They don’t follow the president’s orders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;175&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7160&quot;&gt;Importantly, however, the president was supportive. But even so, as soon as Parliament began debating mandatory iodization in 2002, strong lobbies formed against the measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;327&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7487&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-6&quot;&gt;The country’s biggest salt company was initially reluctant to cooperate, fearing higher costs, a Unicef report said. Cardiologists argued against iodization, fearing it would encourage people to use more salt, which can raise &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/bloodpressure/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&quot; title=&quot;Recent and archival health news about blood pressure.&quot; class=&quot;meta-classifier&quot;&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;. More insidious, Dr. Sharmanov said, were private companies that sold iodine pills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;116&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7603&quot;&gt;“They promoted their products in the mass media, saying iodized salt was dangerous,” he said, shaking his head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;240&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7843&quot;&gt;So Dr. Sharmanov, the national Health Ministry, Ms. Sivryukova and others devised a marketing campaign — much of it paid for by American taxpayers, through money given to Unicef by the United States Agency for International Development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;145&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7988&quot;&gt;Comic strips starring a hooded crusader, Iodine Man, rescuing a slow-witted student from an enraged teacher were handed out across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;194&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8182&quot;&gt;A logo was designed for food packages certified to contain iodized salt: a red dot and a curved line in a circle, meant to represent a face with a smile so big that the eyes are squeezed shut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;186&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8368&quot;&gt;Also, Ms. Sivryukova’s network of local charity women stepped in. As in all ex-Soviet states, government advice is regarded with suspicion, while civic organizations have credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;183&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8551&quot;&gt;Her volunteers approached schools, asking teachers to create dictation exercises about iodized salt and to have students bring salt from home to test it for iodine in science class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;118&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8669&quot;&gt;Ms. Sivryukova described one child’s tears when he realized he was the only one in his class with noniodized salt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;152&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8821&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-7&quot;&gt;The teacher, she said, reassured him that it was not his fault. “Children very quickly start telling their parents to buy the right salt,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;243&quot; data-total-count=&quot;9064&quot;&gt;One female volunteer went to a bus company and rerecorded its “next-stop” announcements interspersed with short plugs for iodized salt. “She had a very sexy voice, and men would tell the drivers to play it again,” Ms. Sivryukova said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;279&quot; data-total-count=&quot;9343&quot;&gt;Even the former world chess champion Anatoly Karpov, who is a hero throughout the former Soviet Union for his years as champion, joined the fight. “Eat iodized salt,” he advised schoolchildren in a television appearance, “and you will grow up to be grandmasters like me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;275&quot; data-total-count=&quot;9618&quot;&gt;Mr. Karpov, in particular, handled hostile journalists adeptly, Mr. Zouev said, deflecting inquiries as to why he did not advocate letting people choose iodized or plain salt by comparing it to the right to have two taps in every home, one for clean water and one for dirty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;64&quot; data-total-count=&quot;9682&quot;&gt;By late 2003, the Parliament finally made iodization mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;31&quot; data-total-count=&quot;9713&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Aral, Mountains Made of Salt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;252&quot; data-total-count=&quot;9965&quot;&gt;Today in central Kazakhstan, a miniature mountain range rises over Aral, a decaying factory town on what was once the shore of the Aral Sea, a salt lake that has steadily shrunk as irrigation projects begun under Stalin drained the rivers that feed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;603&quot; data-total-count=&quot;10568&quot;&gt;Drive closer and the sharp white peaks turn out to be a small Alps of salt — the Aral Tuz Company stockpile. Salt has been dug here for centuries. Nowadays, a great rail-mounted combine chews away at a 10-foot-thick layer of salt in the old seabed, before it is towed 11 miles back to the plant, and washed and ground. Before it reaches the packaging room, as the salt falls through a chute from one conveyor belt to another, a small pump sprays iodine into the grainy white cascade. The step is so simple that, if it were not for the women in white lab coats scooping up samples, it would be missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;170&quot; data-total-count=&quot;10738&quot;&gt;The $15,000 tank and sprayer were donated by Unicef, which also used to supply the potassium iodate. Today Aral Tuz and its smaller rival, Pavlodar Salt, buy their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;350&quot; data-total-count=&quot;11088&quot;&gt;Asked about the Unicef report saying that Aral Tuz initially resisted iodization on the grounds that it would eat up 7 percent of profits, the company’s president, Ontalap Akhmetov, seemed puzzled. “I’ve only been president three years,” he said. “But that makes no sense.” The expense, he said, was minimal. “Only a few cents a ton.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;story-ad-6&quot; class=&quot;story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;285&quot; data-total-count=&quot;11373&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-8&quot;&gt;Kazakhstan was lucky. It had just the right mix of political and economic conditions for success: political support, 98 percent literacy, an economy helped along by rising prices for its oil and gas. Most important, perhaps, one company, Aral Tuz, makes 80 percent of the edible salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;226&quot; data-total-count=&quot;11599&quot;&gt;That combination is missing in many nations where iodine deficiency remains a health crisis. In nearby Pakistan, for instance, where 70 percent of households have no iodized salt, there are more than 600 small salt producers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;402&quot; data-total-count=&quot;12001&quot;&gt;“If a country has a reasonably well-organized salt system and only a couple of big producers who get on the bandwagon, iodization works,” said Venkatesh Mannar, a former salt producer in India who now heads the Micronutrient Initiative in Ottawa, which seeks to fortify the foods of the world’s poor with iodine, iron and other minerals. “If there are a lot of small producers, it doesn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;344&quot; data-total-count=&quot;12345&quot;&gt;Now that Kazakhstan has its law, Ms. Sivryukova’s volunteers have not let up their vigilance. They help enforce it by going to markets, buying salt and testing it on the spot. The government has trained customs agents to test salt imports and fenced some areas where people dug their own salt. Children still receive booklets and instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;498&quot; data-total-count=&quot;12843&quot;&gt;Experts agree the country is unlikely to slip back into neglect. Surveys find consumers very aware of iodine, and the red-and-white logo is such a hit that food producers have asked for permission to use it on foods with added iron or folic acid, said Dr. Sharmanov, the former Kazakh Republic health minister. And the salt is working. In the 1999 survey that found stunted children, a smaller sampling of urine from women of child-bearing age found that 60 percent had suboptimal levels of iodine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;166&quot; data-total-count=&quot;13009&quot;&gt;“We just did a new study, which is not released yet,” said Dr. Feruza Ospanova, head of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/diet/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&quot; title=&quot;Recent and archival health news about diet and nutrition.&quot; class=&quot;meta-classifier&quot;&gt;nutrition&lt;/a&gt; academy’s laboratory. “The number was zero percent.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Introduction to WebAssembly: why should we care?</title>
<link>https://tomassetti.me/introduction-to-webassembly/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://tomassetti.me/introduction-to-webassembly/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;There is a new weapon in the &lt;del&gt;great war against JavaScript&lt;/del&gt; the struggle to allow developers to choose their favorite style of programming while improve performance and their productivity. That weapon is &lt;strong&gt;WebAssembly&lt;/strong&gt;, that will revolutionize client-side web development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WebAssembly, or wasm, is a low-level bytecode format for in-browser client-side scripting&lt;/em&gt;. If you are writing a compiler for a programming language one option is to target a platform, like the JVM or .NET, and compile your language to the target bytecode. WebAssembly occupies the same role, so when you compiling to WebAssembly you are making your software available for all platforms where it is supported, in other words all browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, WebAssembly is implemented by browsers’ developers on the back of the existing JavaScript engine. Essentially, it is designed to substitute JavaScript as the destination of compilers and transpilers on the web. For instance, instead of compiling TypeScript to JavaScript, its developers could now compile to WebAssembly. In short, it is not a new virtual machine, it is a new format for the same JavaScript VM that is included in every browser. This will make possible to take advantage of the existing JavaScript infrastructure, without using JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design of the Minimum Viable Product was completed in March 2017 and now &lt;a href=&quot;https://caniuse.com/#feat=wasm&quot;&gt;there are implementations ready for every major browser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why it Matters?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters, the new WebAssembly format promise &lt;strong&gt;significant gains in terms of parsing performance:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kind of binary format being considered for WebAssembly can be natively decoded much faster than JavaScript can be parsed (experiments show more than 20× faster). On mobile, large compiled codes can easily take 20–40 seconds just to parse, so native decoding (especially when combined with other techniques like streaming for better-than-gzip compression) is critical to providing a good cold-load user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://webassembly.org/docs/faq/&quot;&gt;FAQ of WebAssembly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that we are talking about parsing performance, not necessarily execution performance. Because in many cases it will run on the existing JavaScript engine. However, this increase in parsing performance alone will permit to put on the web software that would have been impractical to develop before. For instance: &lt;a href=&quot;http://webassembly.org/docs/use-cases/&quot;&gt;virtual machines, virtual reality, image recognition, etc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first production users are probably going to be game engine developers, because they are always in search of the best performance. Before WebAssembly the best they could hope for was asm.js (a simplified JavaScript, optimized for speed), which is a cool technology, but it is not really usable for many games. I remember trying the famous demo Epic Citadel (now offline) by Unreal Technology. It actually ran smooth, but it took around 15 minutes to download and parse the code, which is obviously not good enough for a &lt;em&gt;quick game&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.mozilla.org/webassembly/&quot;&gt;Autodesk plans to support WebAssembly for their Stingray game engine&lt;/a&gt; and Unity Technologies, the creators of the Unity game engine, started &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/06/18/webgl-webassembly-and-feature-roadmap/&quot;&gt;experimenting with WebAssembly back in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. The Rust developer also are already working &lt;a href=&quot;https://users.rust-lang.org/t/compiling-to-the-web-with-rust-and-emscripten/7627&quot;&gt;to support WebAssembly to run Rust code on the web&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Can it Do For You&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the greater scheme of things, the arrival of WebAssembly means that &lt;strong&gt;you will not be forced anymore to use JavaScript for the web, because it is the only thing that run in the browser&lt;/strong&gt;. JavaScript has a bad reputation, but in reality is a good language for what is was designed for: quickly write small scripts. The problem is that currently you are forced to use for everything else you need to run on the web, and this is an issue for many large projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that you can use &lt;em&gt;better versions of JavaScript&lt;/em&gt;, like TypeScript, or even new languages like &lt;a href=&quot;https://superkotlin.com/kotlin-javascript/&quot;&gt;Kotlin&lt;/a&gt;. But, in the end they all have to compile down to JavaScript. In turns this has created issues to the developers of JavaScript, that have to support essentially all scenarios and all programming styles. WebAssembly will change that and allows everybody to concentrate on what they can do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is not all: &lt;strong&gt;it will be possible to port WebAssembly to other platforms&lt;/strong&gt;. This means that if you write software in a language that compiles to WebAssembly you might be able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hanselman.com/blog/NETAndWebAssemblyIsThisTheFutureOfTheFrontend.aspx&quot;&gt;run it on .NET&lt;/a&gt;. The fact that it allows to reuse the already existing JavaScript infrastructure on the web means that you can already use it in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is not the only option. You can create your own specific implementation for your needs. You could create an optimized compiler for your language. You could create it from scratch or add WebAssembly support to an existing compiler. Thus doing you could  take advantage of all the other WebAssembly modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, you could create a WebAssembly compiler for a DSL that you use internally on your company and make it run on the web, client-side, without the use of custom plugins like the Oracle Java Plug-in or Adobe Flash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How it Works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://webassembly.org/docs/high-level-goals/&quot;&gt;founding principle of WebAssembly&lt;/a&gt; is to integrate well with the existing JavaScript world. This ranges from technical things, such as inteoperability and sharing the security policies (same-origin), to tooling integration, such as as supporting the View Source functionality of web browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To accomplish this goal WebAssembly defines both a binary format and an equivalent text format, for tools and human readers. Technically the textual format uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression&quot;&gt;S-expressions&lt;/a&gt;, so it will look like the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;crayon:false&quot;&gt;
(func (param i32) (local f64)
  get_local 0
  get_local 1)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the tools will probably show something more similar to this representation (example from the documentation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;C++&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Binary&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Text&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;crayon:false&quot;&gt;
int factorial(int n) {
  if (n == 0)
    return 1;
  else
    return n * factorial(n-1);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may wonder why C++ is used as an example. That is because the objective of the initial release (MVP) of WebAssembly was to support C/C++. Other languages will come later; at moment they are in development. This was chosen for a couple of technical and practical reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The MVP of WebAssembly does not support garbage collection (&lt;a href=&quot;http://webassembly.org/docs/future-features/&quot;&gt;it is in the works&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The implementation of the C/C++ to WebAssembly compiler can rely on a ready to use and battle tested tool like LLVM (one of the most used set of compiler tools)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WebAssembly developers use the LLVM to cut the amount of work necessary to get a working product. Furthermore, this allowed them to easily integrate with other tools that work with LLVM, like Emscripten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an MVP there can be testing and usage by real programmers, which allows to improve WebAssembly accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WebAssembly Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, the official WebAssembly tools can compile only C/C++ to WebAssembly, although other developers have already started working on adding support to other languages and platforms (previously we mentioned .NET and Rust). However, even with official tools  you can already use it for web development it in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;writing WebAssembly in the text format and convert it to binary using the provided tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use a third-party tool that build upon these tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first choice is not really practical for common use, but it is the way to go if you want to get the feel of the format or start working in integrating it in your own tools. There are actually two toolkits: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt&quot;&gt;WebAssembly Binary Toolkit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen&quot;&gt;Binaryen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WABT&lt;/strong&gt; includes tools for development and/or use in tools meant to work with WebAssembly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;it perfectly supports the format specification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it can convert from/to the textual format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it include an interpreter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, it ensures a clean and easy access to the data in the WebAssembly format so that you can work with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, &lt;strong&gt;Binaryen&lt;/strong&gt; is an industrial-strength toolkit meant for usage in a compiler infrastructure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;it can work with WebAssembly code or a control flow graph form meant for compilers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it optimizes the code with many passes, both standard optimization and specific ones for WebAssembly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it can compile from/to asm.js (a subset of JavaScript), Rust MIR (an intermediate language for Rust) and LLVM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, this toolkit is ready to be integrated in your production backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, both allows you to create tools that manipulate WebAssembly, but WABT is designed for tool that are used during development (e.g., static analysis) while Binaryen is made to create production WebAssembly (e.g., compilers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tools are great for whoever develops tools and compiler-related products: they provide both development tools and ready-to-use production tools. However, they are not ideal for normal developers, for them there is an easier way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need to build such tools, there is also a second option: build everything from scratch. This is the way to go if you need a custom compiler or interpreter for your own language, need the best performance or a lightweight tool. Since we have already worked with WebAssembly, we have made a library to help you (and us) working with WebAssembly: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ftomassetti/wasmcompilerkit&quot;&gt;WasmCompilerKit&lt;/a&gt;. It is basically a Kotlin library that you can use to load WASM files, modify them and generating them. Given that it is written in Kotlin, you can use it also from Java and Scala. We are considering transforming it in a multi-platform Kotlin project targeting also JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using WebAssembly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are just a developer interested in using WebAssembly the suggested way of starting is to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/index.html&quot;&gt;Emscripten (SDK)&lt;/a&gt;. Emscripten is a toolchain already used to compile C/C++ in asm.js, a subset of JavaScript invented with similar goals to the ones of WebAssembly. With  Emscripten you can more easily use the previously mentioned Binaryen and integrate it with its own chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you installed Emscripten, or you have it compiled from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/juj/emsdk&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;, you must install binaryen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then compile to WebAssembly and see it in your browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first command will generate three files: a WASM module, an HTML file that shows the code in action and a JS file that setup the Module and take cares of all that is needed to run it. The &lt;code&gt;WASM=1&lt;/code&gt; indicates to Emscripten that we want to generate a WASM module, instead of of an asm.js file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also output your code inside a custom template, using the &lt;code&gt;--shell-file&lt;/code&gt; option. The Emscripten SDK installation contains the basic template in this location &lt;code&gt;(esmdk-folder)/emscripten/incoming/src/shell_minimal.html&lt;/code&gt;. Copy that file in your project and adapt it your needs (e.g., add the rest of your JS code).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also output directly a JS file, but this not recommended at the moment. That is because you need code to take care of low-level issues like memory allocation, memory leaks, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final objective is to make to load WebAssembly module as easy is to load JavaScript code, with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script type='module'&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; HTML code, but we are not there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interoperability Between C and JavaScript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interoperability between C and JavaScript is an issue for Emscripten. The first thing you have to do is to include the header file of emscripten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;crayon-5a39a82edc217620765512&quot; class=&quot;crayon-syntax crayon-theme-son-of-obsidian crayon-font-monaco crayon-os-pc print-yes notranslate&quot; data-settings=&quot; minimize scroll-mouseover wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-plain-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;textarea class=&quot;crayon-plain print-no&quot; data-settings=&quot;dblclick&quot; readonly=&quot;readonly&quot;&gt;
#include &amp;lt;emscripten.h&amp;gt;
&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-main&quot;&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;crayon-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;crayon-row&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;crayon-nums&quot; data-settings=&quot;show&quot;&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;crayon-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-pre&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-line&quot; id=&quot;crayon-5a39a82edc217620765512-1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-p&quot;&gt;#include &amp;lt;emscripten.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easier way to call JavaScript is simply to call the function &lt;code&gt;emscripten_run_script&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;crayon-5a39a82edc21a073032770&quot; class=&quot;crayon-syntax crayon-theme-son-of-obsidian crayon-font-monaco crayon-os-pc print-yes notranslate&quot; data-settings=&quot; minimize scroll-mouseover wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-plain-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;textarea class=&quot;crayon-plain print-no&quot; data-settings=&quot;dblclick&quot; readonly=&quot;readonly&quot;&gt;
// it is equivalent to call eval() in JavaScript
emscripten_run_script(&quot;alert('hello')&quot;);
&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-main&quot;&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;crayon-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;crayon-row&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;crayon-nums&quot; data-settings=&quot;show&quot;&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;crayon-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-pre&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-line&quot; id=&quot;crayon-5a39a82edc21a073032770-1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-c&quot;&gt;// it is equivalent to call eval() in JavaScript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-line crayon-striped-line&quot; id=&quot;crayon-5a39a82edc21a073032770-2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-e&quot;&gt;emscripten_run_script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-sy&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-s&quot;&gt;&quot;alert('hello')&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-sy&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-sy&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead to call a C function from JavaScript is slightly more complicated. First, you have to make it available from C/C++ code, because by default Emscripten makes unavailable all C functions, except for the main one. So, you have to add the modifier &lt;code&gt;EMSCRIPTEN_KEEP_ALIVE&lt;/code&gt; to all functions you want to use in JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;crayon-5a39a82edc21c886503721&quot; class=&quot;crayon-syntax crayon-theme-son-of-obsidian crayon-font-monaco crayon-os-pc print-yes notranslate&quot; data-settings=&quot; minimize scroll-mouseover wrap&quot;&gt;

&lt;textarea class=&quot;crayon-plain print-no&quot; data-settings=&quot;dblclick&quot; readonly=&quot;readonly&quot;&gt;
int EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE factorial(int n) {
  if (n == 0)
    return 1;
  else
    return n * factorial(n-1);
}
&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-main&quot;&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;crayon-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;crayon-row&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;crayon-nums&quot; data-settings=&quot;show&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-line crayon-striped-line&quot; id=&quot;crayon-5a39a82edc21c886503721-2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-h&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-st&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;crayon-sy&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;crayon-o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;crayon-cn&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-sy&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-line&quot; id=&quot;crayon-5a39a82edc21c886503721-5&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-h&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-st&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;crayon-o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;crayon-e&quot;&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-sy&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-cn&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-sy&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-sy&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you write in C++, remember to put any function you want to make available inside an &lt;code&gt;extern 'C'&lt;/code&gt; block, to avoid C++ mangling the name of the function (that is something that C++ does, it is not a WebAssembly or Emscripten bug).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, you have to compile the WebAssembly module with the option &lt;code&gt;NO_EXIT_RUNTIME&lt;/code&gt;, this avoid the shutdown of the runtime at the exit of the main function, which would make impossible to call C code from JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;crayon-5a39a82edc21f848723963&quot; class=&quot;crayon-syntax crayon-theme-son-of-obsidian crayon-font-monaco crayon-os-pc print-yes notranslate&quot; data-settings=&quot; minimize scroll-mouseover wrap&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, you cannot call your C function directly, but you have to use the following syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;crayon-5a39a82edc221766301024&quot; class=&quot;crayon-syntax crayon-theme-son-of-obsidian crayon-font-monaco crayon-os-pc print-yes notranslate&quot; data-settings=&quot; minimize scroll-mouseover wrap&quot;&gt;

             'number', // return type
             ['number'], // argument types
             [4] // arguments
);
&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;crayon-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;crayon-row&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;crayon-nums&quot; data-settings=&quot;show&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen a short introduction to WebAssembly: what it is, why you should care and how you can use it. It is going to be a great platform for the further evolution of the web: it will make developing for the web easier and more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its development is backed by people at Mozilla, Microsoft, Google and Apple. The attention to the tooling is another proof of the importance of WebAssembly: it is going to change the web fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use WebAssembly today and look at more in depth documentation on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly&quot;&gt;MDN website&lt;/a&gt;. If you are interested in knowing more details about the format you can read them on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://webassembly.org/&quot;&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt;. You could also look the &lt;a href=&quot;https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/index.html&quot;&gt;Emscripten documentation&lt;/a&gt; to understand issues related to interoperability between JavaScript and the C/C++ code.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Estonia is planning to launch Estcoin</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/were-planning-to-launch-estcoin-and-that-s-only-the-start-310aba7f3790</guid>
<description>&lt;p name=&quot;1c9c&quot; id=&quot;1c9c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;graf-dropCap&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he startup world is being rapidly transformed by Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4737&quot; id=&quot;4737&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Instead of giving up shares, many startups are now raising finance by issuing their own blockchain-based crypto coins to investors around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e34b&quot; id=&quot;e34b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The US, Singapore and Switzerland are currently the leading jurisdictions for entrepreneurs considering where to launch their ICOs, although all governments are still figuring out how to regulate ICOs. Unfortunately for both entrepreneurs and investors, that means ICOs continue to operate in what could be described as legal grey areas at best, while the lack of clarity and trust is holding back the benefits of this innovation in finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bec9&quot; id=&quot;bec9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Despite this, the amount of money being raised globally by startups through ICOs is now far in excess of the amount being raised through venture capital. Raising finance is only half the story of ICOs though. People who invest in crypto tokens issued by a startup are then strongly incentivised to support the development of that startup in other ways too and they tend to form an online community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d6f6&quot; id=&quot;d6f6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Estonia’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://e-resident.gov.ee/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://e-resident.gov.ee/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;e-Residency&lt;/a&gt; programme is also a fast growing startup — albeit a government startup — because we are constantly improving it based on the feedback of real e-residents, often with best practises that we’ve taken straight from the private sector. We also have our own fast growing community, which is increasingly looking for ways to connect and gain more value from the programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;756f&quot; id=&quot;756f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So in August we published an article on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/e-residency-blog&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/e-residency-blog&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;e-Residency blog&lt;/a&gt; asking what would happen if a country, such as Estonia, decided to launch its own crypto tokens with an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). We nicknamed these proposed tokens ‘estcoins’ and explained how e-Residency would provide the platform for distributing and trading them globally because it’s a secure digital identity that anyone in the world can apply for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b6fa&quot; id=&quot;b6fa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The article went viral almost instantly, generating a large amount of media coverage globally, including in most major publications. Our best estimate is that around 200 million people around the world read about the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3624&quot; id=&quot;3624&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Many people were enthusiastic and wrote about various options for how estcoins could be structured. Many people were also critical, including some who wondered if the whole thing was nothing more than a marketing stunt for the e-Residency programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6795&quot; id=&quot;6795&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We could have developed the idea behind closed doors first, but openness has always been the best policy for developing the e-Residency programme. Starting an open discussion at the earliest possible stage has been useful to gather both the feedback needed to refine the idea and the support needed to proceed with it. Both the supporters and the critics have been invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7d15&quot; id=&quot;7d15&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;My initial assumption was that the crypto community would be the most critical of any government involvement in their sector, but the opposite was true. Entrepreneurs and investors within the crypto world expressed enormous interest and largely seemed to welcome the idea, while traditional institutions were the most critical. Even European Central Bank President Mario Draghi voiced his concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;fe58&quot; id=&quot;fe58&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--mixtapeEmbed&quot;&gt;Much of the criticism of estcoin was based on the fact that Estonia simply can’t start its own cryptocurrency even if it wanted to. Estonia’s only currency is the euro and this is an essential feature of our EU membership, which we are proud to have. No one here is interested in changing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e082&quot; id=&quot;e082&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;That’s why we have always referred to estcoin as a proposed ‘crypto token’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;35b9&quot; id=&quot;35b9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Governments do need to consider the disruptive impact of how crypto tokens can be used as currency because they provide a more efficient means for exchanging value globally. However, crypto tokens have far more significance than their use as a currency and don’t necessarily fall into that category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ba8a&quot; id=&quot;ba8a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;From Estonia’s perspective, estcoins were proposed as a way to raise money and support for the development of our digital nation from more people around the world. We would also want to structure the tokens so that they help build our e-resident community and incentivise our own key objective, which is to increase the number of companies started in Estonia through e-Residency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;841d&quot; id=&quot;841d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This activity already has a major positive impact on Estonia as e-residents bring a significant amount of business to the Estonian economy. &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.err.ee/646254/deloitte-e-residency-brought-14-4-million-to-estonia-in-first-three-years&quot; data-href=&quot;http://news.err.ee/646254/deloitte-e-residency-brought-14-4-million-to-estonia-in-first-three-years&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;An independent report released this month by Deloitte&lt;/a&gt; revealed that e-residents have already brought €14.4 million back to Estonia in the first three years and this is predicted to rise to €1.8 billion by 2025, which is a return of €100 for every €1 invested in the programme. We will only achieve this though if we continue to provide real value to our e-residents around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1f5e&quot; id=&quot;1f5e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The purpose of estcoin is to accelerate this, while also providing additional funds and interest for the development of our digital nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;abfe&quot; id=&quot;abfe&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The question remains though — What problem does estcoin solve for people who hold estcoins? This is another key and commonly repeated criticism of the proposal that estcoin is ‘a solution looking for a problem’. Since the proposal was published, I’ve been repeatedly asking audiences if they would be interested in purchasing estcoins and the response is a resounding yes, even if they are not always sure why yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;e343&quot; id=&quot;e343&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;You might be surprised to hear this, but we completely agree with the criticism that estcoin is a solution looking for a problem. However, that is not necessarily a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f06f&quot; id=&quot;f06f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;E-Residency was also a solution looking for a problem when the programme was launched. The solution was to enable anyone in the world to apply for an Estonian ID digital ID card and then gain access to our e-services, but even many of the first e-residents were not sure what problems this would solve for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3c29&quot; id=&quot;3c29&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Three years (and almost 30,000 applications) later, we now have a very good understanding of the problems that e-Residency solves by helping democratise access to entrepreneurship globally and enabling the rise of location-independence. You can read more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/who-are-estonias-e-residents-f8c2ba2bee3d&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/who-are-estonias-e-residents-f8c2ba2bee3d&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;who are Estonia’s e-residents here&lt;/a&gt; or learn about some of their problems solved by the programme in this advert we made:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;ae61&quot; id=&quot;ae61&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Since the estcoin proposal was made, we’ve been carefully reading and listening to feedback from around the world. As a result, we do now have a better understanding of not just how estcoin could be structured, but also why people would want to hold them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7040&quot; id=&quot;7040&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Before I outline that though, I want to explain the one thing that we need to do first (and why) for our vision of estcoin to become reality: &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;we must make e-Residency the best option globally for launching a trusted ICO.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;e7df&quot; id=&quot;e7df&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h3-strong&quot;&gt;Trusted e-Residency ICOs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;57e6&quot; id=&quot;57e6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Blockchain technology has opened up a divide in the way we structure our world. On one side there are governments and traditional institutions, while on the other side is the crypto community. Both of these sides often behave as if the other has no future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;af09&quot; id=&quot;af09&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Like most things, the truth is somewhere in the middle and this division is holding everyone back. By not embracing crypto, governments are failing to unlock a powerful driver of economic growth and risk losing relevance entirely. By not embracing public oversight, legitimate crypto investors are tarnished by fraudulent ones, and crypto investors are far less certain about the value and legitimacy of their tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b205&quot; id=&quot;b205&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For an overview of the risks and complexities involved, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has just published a comprehensive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-clayton-2017-12-11&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-clayton-2017-12-11&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement on cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings&lt;/a&gt; that is worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;06a8&quot; id=&quot;06a8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We all need to acknowledge that blockchain is developing powerful new solutions that are going to disrupt the world, but public authorities can play a key role in supporting this for the benefit of everyone. In effect, we need a peace agreement between these two sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;366f&quot; id=&quot;366f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;That’s now happening in Estonia. After the estcoin proposal was published, I organised a kickoff meeting inside the Estonian Parliament involving representatives from across Estonia’s public and private sector, as well as key crypto entrepreneurs and ‘hackers’ from around the world. It was attended by members of the e-Residency programme team, our advisory committee, Estonia’s Ministry of Finance, Estonian Parliamentarians, the Bank of Estonia, companies conducting ICOs, and law firms advising them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*USgaKWg0uWyO0LuJ.&quot; data-width=&quot;1400&quot; data-height=&quot;733&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*USgaKWg0uWyO0LuJ.&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*USgaKWg0uWyO0LuJ.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f91a&quot; id=&quot;f91a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I particularly want to thank Trent McConaghy, Anish Mohammed and Bruce Pon for going the extra mile (well, thousands) by flying to Estonia for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1a2c&quot; id=&quot;1a2c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Together, we began the enormous task of understanding how Estonia could better embrace blockchain and the use of crypto tokens in a way that supports legitimate entrepreneurs and helps grow our digital nation, while protecting our public interest and minimising risks to our state and business environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1b73&quot; id=&quot;1b73&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We sought to learn from the best practises developed in other countries, but also explore how Estonia’s unique advantages can take us further. Since then, we have continued to work closely together and are constantly exploring solutions and exchanging ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a223&quot; id=&quot;a223&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For understandably cautious reasons, Estonia has not so far been a particularly friendly jurisdiction towards crypto. To our surprise then, the first thing that we discovered is that there are many aspects of Estonia’s business environment that crypto entrepreneurs already hugely favour — from 100% online cross-border management to a 0% corporation tax on undistributed profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1b87&quot; id=&quot;1b87&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In addition, our secure digital identities can be used as part of the KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures that would otherwise cost companies both more time and more money when they need to verify identities of investors and customers. Everyone’s heard stories about investors losing access to their crypto tokens — perhaps because they forgot their private key for example — but this doesn’t happen to e-residents if their wallets are linked to their government-backed digital identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;69e4&quot; id=&quot;69e4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In fact, a number of companies are in the process of launching ICOs in Estonia through e-Residency, while various others are planning theirs and are already exploring how to integrate the e-Residency card into their KYC procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e258&quot; id=&quot;e258&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As the ICO phenomenon continues to grow, there will be particular nations that become “havens” for companies launching them. However, we do have concerns about the current state of the ICO market and do not want to attract just any ICOs. Too many ICO investors have already been left disappointed by poor behaviour and lack of transparency from those that they have given their money to. Many ICOs also try to use the reputations of organisations and people who may have no real involvement in the project. With that in mind, please note that any announcements from e-Residency (or other parts of the Estonian state) related to our proposed crypto token or how Estonia is supporting ICOs would always be shared in detail on this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c7dc&quot; id=&quot;c7dc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The reality is that a large proportion of ICOs simply won’t have the standards that we desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5a6d&quot; id=&quot;5a6d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In addition, the value of crypto tokens in general are extremely volatile right now so the rapid gains we are currently witnessing by Bitcoin and others could easily be followed by rapid devaluations in the near future. Many analysts have pointed out similarities between the booming crypto market today and the booming dotcom market of the 90s, which eventually did burst. However, the fundamental technology behind it — the internet in that case — did go on to change the world and open up vast new possibilities so the same thing could happen to crypto, even if it’s also a bubble about to burst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e008&quot; id=&quot;e008&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What people are looking for, in any eventuality, is real value through greater trust. Trust is also the most important value behind e-Residency though because we are offering a secure government-backed digital identity that provides access to our open and transparent business environment. That’s why we will focus on attracting trusted ICOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2ff7&quot; id=&quot;2ff7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So how can we better support trusted ICOs through e-Residency?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fa1c&quot; id=&quot;fa1c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The most obvious solution at first is to change laws. Estonia has certainly shown a willingness to both amend legislation to support e-resident entrepreneurs when appropriate and to amend legislation to support emerging industries. Estonia is, for example, the first country in Europe to legalise &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/15/estonia-welcomes-delivery-robots-to-sidewalks/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/15/estonia-welcomes-delivery-robots-to-sidewalks/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;delivery robots&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.eu/article/uber-estonia-europe-london-licensing-ride-sharing/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.politico.eu/article/uber-estonia-europe-london-licensing-ride-sharing/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ride sharing apps&lt;/a&gt;. There’s even a discussion underway about &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/estonia-starts-public-discussion-legalising-ai-166cb8e34596&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/estonia-starts-public-discussion-legalising-ai-166cb8e34596&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;how Estonia can legalise Artificial Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e8e1&quot; id=&quot;e8e1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But it’s not always necessary to legislate in order to find solutions. In addition, there are enormous complexities that must be addressed first and some of this is at the EU level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;edad&quot; id=&quot;edad&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Those discussions are ongoing, but the first thing we can do is relatively straight forward: &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;We can provide clearer guidance on how to legally and responsibly launch an ICO within our regulatory environment&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ab79&quot; id=&quot;ab79&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The e-Residency programme is keen to support responsible ICOs. Although we would obviously never ‘back’ an organisation’s ICO, we &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; encourage ICOs launching through e-Residency to follow a strict set of best practises outlined in our guidelines in order to provide a higher level of trust and transparency to investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6347&quot; id=&quot;6347&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We are still working on the details and we would love to read your comments below about what should be added to the guidelines, but it would include, for example, an overview of how to classify crypto tokens, what rules need to be followed to comply with laws and which best practises should always be followed too, such as ensuring that investors can easily monitor how the money raised is spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d6a3&quot; id=&quot;d6a3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;One particularly tricky issue for ICOs at the moment is whether tokens should be classified as security or utility tokens. We need to ensure that our guidance embraces both and encourages entrepreneurs to accept the right classification for their needs, instead of attempting to structure their ICOs in a way that avoids certain responsibilities. We understand that entrepreneurs are wary of having their crypto tokens labelled as securities, but this provides greater trust to investors so we should instead be bold enough to consider how our business environment can be more supportive to entrepreneurs who do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fdfa&quot; id=&quot;fdfa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Since the estcoin proposal was published, there was a significant spike in applications for e-Residency and we know many of them signed up because they are interested in investing in ICOs. This means that companies that launch their ICOs through e-Residency and integrate our digital IDs have access to a growing community of investors who can be onboarded at lower cost, time and hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b486&quot; id=&quot;b486&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Many e-residents &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/e-residency-is-connecting-investors-and-startups-in-unusual-places-7091f6c927e0&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/e-residency-is-connecting-investors-and-startups-in-unusual-places-7091f6c927e0&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;already use the programme for investment purposes&lt;/a&gt;, but our longer term objective is to create an economy of scale for both investors and entrepreneurs to use our platform together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;948c&quot; id=&quot;948c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The private sector will also need to perform an important role supporting this by providing even more of the services required to support both groups, such as financial and legal services. If you are reading this and think your company can help support this growth then please do get in touch with our team on &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:e-resident@gov.ee&quot; data-href=&quot;mailto:e-resident@gov.ee&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;e-resident@gov.ee&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a48c&quot; id=&quot;a48c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Our aim is for Estonia to become the best option globally for trusted ICOs as a result of our public and private sectors working together to make the most of our advantages, including our transparent business environment and our e-Residency programme. Estonia has been at the forefront of technological innovation in business ever since engineers in Estonia discovered how to cut out the middlemen of the telecommunications industry by building Skype. We now have the opportunity to cut out the middlemen of central stock registries with a combination of blockchain, crypto tokens and secure digital identities. This would provide truly decentralised and trusted peer-to-peer securities trading globally through e-Residency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;fa02&quot; id=&quot;fa02&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h3-strong&quot;&gt;How will estcoin work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b16b&quot; id=&quot;b16b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;As part of these discussions across the public and private sector, we have also examined how Estonia’s own crypto token could function, taking into account the feedback that we have received globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4b55&quot; id=&quot;4b55&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This project was initially nicknamed ‘estcoin’, which we have always explained is a working title, but it has rapidly become a global brand so we will continue using it at present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cccf&quot; id=&quot;cccf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We have identified not one, but three variants of estcoin that would benefit both our digital nation and those who use them. All three of these models of estcoin are viable and can be introduced (even without alarming the European Central Bank).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8386&quot; id=&quot;8386&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We are proceeding with estcoin not despite the criticism aimed at the proposal, but thanks to the criticism because it has enabled us to better understand how to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c408&quot; id=&quot;c408&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It is possible that one of these variants will become a reality or that more than one model would be chosen to operate simultaneously as estcoin in order to meet multiple purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;59e8&quot; id=&quot;59e8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Here’s an overview of the three estcoin variants and the thinking behind them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;01db&quot; id=&quot;01db&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h4-strong&quot;&gt;1. The community estcoin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c543&quot; id=&quot;c543&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;I mentioned that one of the advantages of crypto tokens is to incentivise behaviour by ensuring that token holders benefit from the growth of their community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;627d&quot; id=&quot;627d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It’s an important point emphasised to us by Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin when we outlined our idea and showed him the first article in advance of publishing it. As we quoted him at the time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f8a0&quot; id=&quot;f8a0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;“An ICO within the e-Residency ecosystem would create a strong incentive alignment between e-residents and this fund, and beyond the economic aspect makes the e-residents feel like more of a community since there are more things they can do together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;84e8&quot; id=&quot;84e8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The community estcoin would be structured to support the objective of growing our new digital nation by incentivising more people around the world to apply for and make greater use of e-Residency. This includes encouraging investors and entrepreneurs to use e-Residency as their platform for trusted ICO activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9116&quot; id=&quot;9116&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;There are currently an enormous number of e-residents who already volunteer their help to grow our digital nation in different ways, such as by producing content about their experiences or encouraging others to sign up, but it’s been a challenge to understand how we can reward them as well as provide support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0e5e&quot; id=&quot;0e5e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In addition, one of the most valuable activities that e-residents do to grow the value of the programme is to conduct business with each other, as well as Estonians. This means that e-Residency is not just access to valuable services, but also access to an increasingly valuable community of like-minded people who can help you grow your company too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bf27&quot; id=&quot;bf27&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Fortunately, we are already developing a community platform so we want to ensure then that estcoins could have a real utility value within that platform and that they could be automatically issued in exchange for activities that support the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bf8b&quot; id=&quot;bf8b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For example, e-residents should be able to earn estcoins if they drive web traffic to e-Residency, successfully sign up a new e-resident, post a tender within our community that provides work to another e-resident or Estonian company, or spend time providing useful advice to other e-residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ed23&quot; id=&quot;ed23&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Estcoins will enable that platform to grow faster through a network effect, but it’s possible that any funds raised could also be allocated to further develop this platform, as well as provide investment into companies that operate within Estonia’s business environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2c76&quot; id=&quot;2c76&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We would also like to involve private sector service providers in this too because they are a crucial part of the e-Residency ecosystem and they provide some of the ‘scarce resources’ that people would want to use their estcoins to acquire, such as accountancy, banking or virtual offices. There are a growing range of companies offering a growing range of services to e-residents so we could start encouraging them to integrate the exchange of estcoins too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;978b&quot; id=&quot;978b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In fact, a national ICO to launch community estcoins would likely require the creation of a Public-Private Partnership as no single organisation should have control of both the tokens and the allocation of any funds raised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f1a8&quot; id=&quot;f1a8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Although our primary focus for developing estcoin at this stage is their utility, it is also important that those who hold these estcoins are able to benefit in future in return for helping grow our digital nation by developing e-Residency. This will eventually mean that community estcoins should be openly tradable on both traditional and crypto exchanges, but is likely that there will be a lock-up period to discourage speculators during the launch and ensure that estcoin holders gain from the long-term growth of our digital nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ebfb&quot; id=&quot;ebfb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Transparency is important and not just for e-residents and their companies, but also for the programme. That means we need to be clear about the total supply of estcoins, what they can be used for and their classification in law. A federated blockchain would likely be required to provide leadership of the network to the Estonian government and independent organisations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7501&quot; id=&quot;7501&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Crypto tokens used in this way enable vast numbers of people operate independently to work together for the benefit of everyone. We already know that e-residents want to connect and conduct more business with each other and we already know from the past few months that there are more numbers of people who want to acquire estcoins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;68f9&quot; id=&quot;68f9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As a digital startup, the e-Residency programme is doing what’s never been done before by scaling up an entire country online. This is currently happening at an ever increasing rate as the benefits of being an e-resident increase. Community estcoins would be the mechanism to accelerate this and radically improve our entire service by increasing the value of joining our community and rewarding those who help us build it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;7fe3&quot; id=&quot;7fe3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h4-strong&quot;&gt;2. The identity estcoin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0cba&quot; id=&quot;0cba&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;At the heart of Estonia’s digital nation — and our e-Residency programme — is a secure, government-issued digital identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2afe&quot; id=&quot;2afe&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It’s a world leading initiative in digital identity, but the technology that underpins it requires continuous development in order to remain cutting edge. Estonia is already a blockchain nation in many ways so what would happen if we also starting using blockchain technology to tokenise identities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0da0&quot; id=&quot;0da0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In this model, estcoins would be the blockchain-based tokens used for activities within our digital society, such as digitally signing documents, logging into services or enforcing smart contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3a07&quot; id=&quot;3a07&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Estonians and e-residents would receive a certain amount of tokens that are personal and attached to their digital identity and can then acquire more when required. Even if these identity estcoins would need to be purchased, this would not raise any additional revenue for Estonia, but merely contribute to the maintenance of the network. In fact, everyone would save money as a result of this proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ef1e&quot; id=&quot;ef1e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Here’s where these estcoins differ sharply from the previous model. Identity estcoins can not be exchanged or sold because they are part of your identity. In fact, the value of them would decrease as the e-Residency programme grows and more people join the network. This would create an economy of scale, which constantly lowers the cost of transactions over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;63a7&quot; id=&quot;63a7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This system would enable even greater transparency within our business environment, which not everyone in the world might appreciate, but it is the key reason why people become e-residents. Transparency provides them with the trust needed to more easily conduct business globally. In fact, this estcoin model could even provide our partners at the Estonian Police and Border Guard Board with the ability to revoke tokens in certain circumstances where laws have been broken by an e-resident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d436&quot; id=&quot;d436&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Why would Estonians and e-residents want this model to proceed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;057d&quot; id=&quot;057d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Identity estcoins would eliminate some of the technology that is currently required to operate our digital nation and that would also eliminate much of the costs and hassle that this technology brings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1aa9&quot; id=&quot;1aa9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Estonians and e-residents would benefit from these lower costs and be able to do almost anything online using their digital IDs with greater ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8b98&quot; id=&quot;8b98&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For example, we recently faced challenges with the certificates used on digital ID cards so they had to be suspended. No one’s digital identities were compromised and new certificates were provided for download as fast as possible, but it wasn’t a smooth process. In addition, this issue highlighted how our digital nation depends on coordinating an enormous range of private sector providers to integrate our digital identities and ensure they function smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fd67&quot; id=&quot;fd67&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In contrast, identity estcoins would work with any device and never require updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4c22&quot; id=&quot;4c22&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For Estonia, this would not just radically improve the reliability, security and transparency of our digital infrastructure, but also enable our country to scale up more effectively. Various parts of the Estonian government work incredibly hard together to ensure our country benefits from e-Residency, from the Police and Border Guard who issue the cards to our embassies around the world who receive them in the diplomatic post then conduct the face-to-face meetings to hand them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b2e4&quot; id=&quot;b2e4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;However, if we can improve and legalise remote verification for acquiring a digital identity then e-residents could join our digital nation almost instantly online instead of having to wait for their card to be administered and then travel to collect it in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c1eb&quot; id=&quot;c1eb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The introduction of identity estcoins would also help future-proof our digital nation and ensure we are prepared to take advantage of even more possibilities in future as technology and legislation evolves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;96a3&quot; id=&quot;96a3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h4-strong&quot;&gt;3. The euro estcoin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4621&quot; id=&quot;4621&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;We’ve discussed models for estcoin that either increase or decrease in value, but what if we introduced estcoins and simply pegged their value to the euro? That’s how euro estcoins would work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;94b3&quot; id=&quot;94b3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We would never provide an alternative currency to the euro, but it’s possible that we could combine some of the decentralised advantages of crypto with the stability and trust of fiat currency and then limit its use within the e-resident community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;aced&quot; id=&quot;aced&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Banks would be required to move money in and out of euro estcoins, but transactions could then take place independently of them through the blockchain. This means that community-based value exchanges could take place globally for free. All that is required is a digital wallet and the commitment of government to buy back every euro estcoin for one euro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bfe9&quot; id=&quot;bfe9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If I think about our e-Residency programme team as a very small community of 15 people then look at how that would work with something as simple as birthdays. There’s now 15 people on the team so each time there’s a birthday we tend to spend about ten euros each. That’s 13 payments each time, which cost the banks about 40 cents each so that adds up to a hidden payment of over €5, as well as delays in processing it. However, this value is being constantly circulated between us so why should the banks be involved just because we want this exchange to take place digitally? Daily life would be faster and more efficient if we could exchange value independent of the banking network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;28b8&quot; id=&quot;28b8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Now look at the complexities of our e-resident community who are engaging in cross-border exchanges every day. Our e-residents are world citizens and the ability to conduct business globally with greater ease is one of the main drivers behind the growth of the programme. Euro estcoins within the e-resident community could facilitate this exchange of value globally, while encouraging more business among e-residents and Estonians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6e46&quot; id=&quot;6e46&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The way euro estcoins operate within the e-Residency community would be similar to how other types of tokens operate within video games or simulated online worlds. E-residents could purchase euro estcoins within their new platform then trade them with other e-residents and cash out when required, while ensuring that all necessary banking and taxations rules are followed. The main difference of course is that e-residents are not playing with these tokens within the platform for fun. Instead, what they can win from the introduction of this variant of estcoin is frictionless global trade with other e-residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;55b5&quot; id=&quot;55b5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h3-strong&quot;&gt;Join the new digital nation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e6a6&quot; id=&quot;e6a6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;We know that tokenisation through blockchain technology will be an important part of our planet’s future and that ICOs are rapidly transforming the way startups grow, but that issues of trust and legality need to be addressed. We also know that there is demand for our proposed estcoins and that these could help our e-resident community grow more exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5add&quot; id=&quot;5add&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We will continue to develop these proposals with the public and private sector in Estonia, as well as with crypto entrepreneurs, investors and potential private sector partners around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;83b3&quot; id=&quot;83b3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As I’ve previously written in my vision for e-Residency, we are living in a very brief period in human history in which the world’s population is confined in its opportunities by the geopolitical boundaries. For now, a nation is assigned to us at birth then usually stays with us for life. This random allocation of the world’s population determines our life opportunities more than almost any other single factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;885d&quot; id=&quot;885d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;However, change is coming. Crypto tokenisation will alter the nature of our world whether we act or not, so we must ensure we are taking a lead and that is already happening in Estonia. Our focus will remain on our overall objective to grow our new digital nation and democratise access to entrepreneurship globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-captionText--2WFdF Media-captionText--2e27a&quot;&gt;Workers at a drilling site in the Czech Republic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gordon Welters for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;On the slope of a thickly forested Czech mountain, three men in hard hats and mud-spattered fluorescent vests dig for the metal that could power a new industrial revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;They watch carefully as a mobile rig, mounted on tank treads, hammers and spins a drill bit hundreds of yards into the bedrock. Water gushes from the bore as the bit punctures an underground spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;The men are prospecting for new sources of lithium, a raw material now found primarily in China and Chile that could become as important to the auto industry as oil is now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Faster than anyone expected, electric cars are becoming as economical and practical as cars with conventional engines. Prices for lithium-ion batteries are plummeting, while technical advances are increasing driving ranges and cutting recharging times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;“Once the trend gets going, it can happen very fast,” said Guido Jouret, chief digital officer at ABB, an electronics company based in Zurich whose businesses include constructing charging stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;But this electric-car future is still missing some pieces. Some crucial raw materials are scarce. There are not enough places to recharge. Battery-powered cars still cost thousands of dollars more than many gasoline vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Car companies are racing to overcome these obstacles. They, and the millions of people they employ, risk becoming irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;“Many people are nervous about how fast this is coming and how much they have to invest,” said Norbert Dressler, a senior partner at Roland Berger in Stuttgart, Germany, who advises the auto industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Here’s a look at what needs to happen before electric cars take over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-captionText--2WFdF Media-captionText--2e27a&quot;&gt;A battery being inspected inside the factory of a Daimler subsidiary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gordon Welters for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;Heading2-heading2--2UY6W elementStyles-heading2--slXZ7 elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z elementStyles-center--1LIQ8&quot;&gt;The cost of building motors and components will have to continue to decrease.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;__typename elementStyles-rule--TgcmK elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Label-label--28y05 elementStyles-label--1-Nry elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z elementStyles-center--1LIQ8&quot;&gt;Price of an electric car powertrain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;Heading3-heading3--20aUg elementStyles-heading3--2nLGt elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z elementStyles-center--1LIQ8&quot;&gt;$16,000&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Label-label--28y05 elementStyles-label--1-Nry elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z elementStyles-center--1LIQ8&quot;&gt;Price of a conventional car powertrain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;Heading3-heading3--20aUg elementStyles-heading3--2nLGt elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z elementStyles-center--1LIQ8&quot;&gt;$6,000&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;__typename elementStyles-rule--TgcmK elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Electric cars will go mainstream when the cost of the powertrain — the motor and other guts that make the vehicle move — is the same as owning cars that burn gasoline or diesel. How soon that day arrives is almost solely a function of the price of batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Battery prices, measured by the power they produce, have already fallen by more than half since 2011, according to analysts at &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://rsch.baml.com/r?q=pbJPXttSQmzgYxdwLoWkhg&amp;amp;e=alexandra.fletcher%40baml.com&amp;amp;h=LOgZdA&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot;&gt;Bank of America Merrill Lynch.&lt;/a&gt; The unexpectedly rapid drop in prices has sped up the timetable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Merrill Lynch analysts now expect electric vehicles in the United States will be cheaper than their traditional counterparts by 2024. Just a year ago, they estimated it would take until 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;One reason battery costs are falling is that manufacturers are ramping up production. The greater the supply, the lower the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Car companies like Daimler are getting into the battery business. Daimler has invested $590 million in a new battery plant in Kamenz, a sleepy city in a rural part of eastern Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;“This is an important investment in the future,” Chancellor Angela Merkel told Daimler executives and other dignitaries at a groundbreaking in May. Within a few months, workers had erected prefabricated concrete walls for the enormous new building and assembled the roof girders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;“We could buy batteries,” said Jupp Kaufer, head of quality at Accumotive, Daimler’s battery unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;But Daimler would rather earn the profits than pay them to a supplier like Samsung or Panasonic. “The battery is a crucial part of the vehicle,” Mr. Kaufer said as he walked through the assembly line of another factory in Kamenz that is already running at capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-captionText--2WFdF Media-captionText--2e27a&quot;&gt;A lithium mine in the Sichuan province of China.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gilles Sabrié for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;Heading2-heading2--2UY6W elementStyles-heading2--slXZ7 elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z elementStyles-center--1LIQ8&quot;&gt;There must be a steady, affordable supply of the resources required to make batteries.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;__typename elementStyles-rule--TgcmK elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Label-label--28y05 elementStyles-label--1-Nry elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z elementStyles-center--1LIQ8&quot;&gt;Price of cobalt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;Heading3-heading3--20aUg elementStyles-heading3--2nLGt elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z elementStyles-center--1LIQ8&quot;&gt;Up 115 percent this year&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Label-label--28y05 elementStyles-label--1-Nry elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z elementStyles-center--1LIQ8&quot;&gt;Price of lithium:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;Heading3-heading3--20aUg elementStyles-heading3--2nLGt elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z elementStyles-center--1LIQ8&quot;&gt;Up 45 percent&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Label-label--28y05 elementStyles-label--1-Nry elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z elementStyles-center--1LIQ8&quot;&gt;Price of graphite:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;Heading3-heading3--20aUg elementStyles-heading3--2nLGt elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z elementStyles-center--1LIQ8&quot;&gt;Up 30 percent&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;__typename elementStyles-rule--TgcmK elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Carmakers are racing to secure the essential ingredients in batteries like cobalt, lithium and graphite. They need to avoid shortages that would drive prices too high, making electric vehicles unaffordable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;But manufacturers are also dealing with a geopolitical dimension. Three-quarters of the world’s reserves of lithium, a crucial ingredient in the most common kind of electric car battery, are in China and Chile, according to the &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/lithium/mcs-2017-lithi.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot;&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt;. As demand surges, China could deploy its natural resources as a diplomatic cudgel the same way that Saudi Arabia uses oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;The risk that a few countries could control most of the ingredients for electric car batteries is what spurred the drilling crew to the mountainside in Cinovec in the Czech Republic. As early as the 1300s, miners dug tin — “cin” in Czech — from the mountains around the town. Later, the area was an important source of tungsten, but the last shaft closed in 1993. Demand for lithium has made mining in the area attractive again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;European Metals Holdings Ltd., an Australian company, is drilling into the bedrock and hauling out core samples to map deposits. The company plans to complete a feasibility study next year and begin mining and processing the ore in Cinovec soon after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;“We are already in touch with some battery makers,” Richard Pavlik, manager of a European Metals subsidiary overseeing the work in Cinovec, said as he watched the drilling crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;As for cobalt, it comes primarily from the Democratic Republic of Congo, one of the world’s most war-torn and unstable countries. Illegal mining operations there have been accused of using child labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Mining companies are hunting for sources in less problematic locations. First Cobalt, based in Toronto, has announced plans to reopen a former silver and cobalt mine in the aptly named town of Cobalt, Ontario. “We think we are at a point of no return with electric vehicles,” said Trent Mell, the company’s chief executive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-captionText--2WFdF Media-captionText--2e27a&quot;&gt;A Tesla owner charging his car at a station in Mountain View, Calif., earlier this year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jason Henry for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;Heading2-heading2--2UY6W elementStyles-heading2--slXZ7 elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z elementStyles-center--1LIQ8&quot;&gt;More charging stations will need to be built, and they’ll need to charge faster.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;__typename elementStyles-rule--TgcmK elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Label-label--28y05 elementStyles-label--1-Nry elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z elementStyles-center--1LIQ8&quot;&gt;Average range of a gasoline-powered car:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;Heading3-heading3--20aUg elementStyles-heading3--2nLGt elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z elementStyles-center--1LIQ8&quot;&gt;475 miles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Label-label--28y05 elementStyles-label--1-Nry elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z elementStyles-center--1LIQ8&quot;&gt;Average range of an electric vehicle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;Heading3-heading3--20aUg elementStyles-heading3--2nLGt elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z elementStyles-center--1LIQ8&quot;&gt;190 miles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;__typename elementStyles-rule--TgcmK elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Even when people can buy an electric car for the same price or less than a gasoline model, they face another problem: where to plug it in. And they won’t want to wait all day for the car to recharge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Electric cars will become commonplace once there is a dense network of high-voltage charging stations where drivers can refill their batteries in the time it takes to use the restroom and drink a cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;At the moment, a cross-country drive in an electric car is an adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Edwin Stafford, a professor of marketing at Utah State University in Logan, Utah, carefully plotted his charging stops before setting out recently in his Tesla S for Berkeley, Calif., with his family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Tesla S owners have free access to Tesla charging stations and can use the waiting time to have a meal or shop. In half an hour, a high voltage Tesla “supercharger” can supply enough juice to travel 170 miles, according to Tesla. But the amenities at charging stations varied, Mr. Stafford said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;At one in Nevada, the only nearby business was a casino, he said. At another, the charging apparatus was blocked by an illegally parked truck. Close to the Bay Area, there were sometimes lines of other Tesla owners waiting to charge, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;But an array of start-ups and established companies like ABB are busy installing charging stations around the world, and they are on their way to becoming commonplace. There are already about 16,000 public charging stations in the United States, up from a few hundred in 2010. That compares with about 112,000 gas stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Surprisingly, &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/business/volkswagen-diesel-emissions-timeline.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot;&gt;Volkswagen’s emissions scandal&lt;/a&gt; has accelerated the rollout. As part of its settlement with diesel owners in the United States who bought cars with illegal software, Volkswagen agreed to spend $2 billion to promote electric cars and build infrastructure. Electrify America, a company established to invest the settlement money, plans to install more than 2,000 fast chargers nationwide by mid-2019 in a first phase, with thousands more to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;Heading2-heading2--2UY6W elementStyles-heading2--slXZ7 elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z elementStyles-center--1LIQ8&quot;&gt;Drivers will have to shed their attachment to the sound, smell and feel of gas-powered engines.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;__typename elementStyles-rule--TgcmK elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Label-label--28y05 elementStyles-label--1-Nry elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z elementStyles-center--1LIQ8&quot;&gt;time from 0 to 60 m.p.h., Audi A8:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;Heading3-heading3--20aUg elementStyles-heading3--2nLGt elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z elementStyles-center--1LIQ8&quot;&gt;4 seconds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Label-label--28y05 elementStyles-label--1-Nry elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z elementStyles-center--1LIQ8&quot;&gt;time from 0 to 60 m.p.h., Tesla S:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;Heading3-heading3--20aUg elementStyles-heading3--2nLGt elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z elementStyles-center--1LIQ8&quot;&gt;2.3 seconds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;__typename elementStyles-rule--TgcmK elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;One of the biggest barriers for electric vehicles is psychological. People are used to internal combustion engines and the sensations that go with them — the odor of the fuel, the shifting of the transmission, the sound of the engine as the car accelerates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Electric cars have a different personality that people need to get their heads around before they will buy one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;They may be pleasantly surprised. The physics of electric motors give them exceptional acceleration. A $135,000 Tesla S clocked by &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/model-s/2017/2017-tesla-model-s-p100d-first-test-review/?sm_id=organic_tw_social_MT_170207_sf54783948#sf54783948&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot;&gt;Motor Trend&lt;/a&gt; magazine went from zero to 60 miles per hour faster than Ferraris, Lamborghinis or Porsches costing hundreds of thousands of dollars more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Electric cars are quiet, nearly vibration free and they don’t smell like gasoline or exhaust. They don’t need oil changes. They cost less to operate — about 1 cent per mile compared to 10 cents per mile for a gasoline-powered car. Electric cars hug the road because heavy battery packs, typically arrayed underneath the passenger compartment, provide low centers of gravity and high stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;“There is no question that an electric car gives you significantly better performance,” Mr. Stafford said. “I don’t think the mainstream driver is going to understand that unless they experience it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;Heading2-heading2--2UY6W elementStyles-heading2--slXZ7 elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z elementStyles-center--1LIQ8&quot;&gt;The car industry will have to leave some of its old methods of production by the side of the road.&lt;/h2&gt;

The transition will be painful for traditional carmakers and suppliers, potentially even catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Electric cars have about 25 percent fewer parts than conventional autos. Companies that make engine parts like pistons, fuel injection systems or spark plugs will have to find new products to sell, or die. Some workers’ skills will no longer be needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Governments will lose fuel tax revenues. Filling stations and auto repair shops will go out of business. To compete with Tesla, which allows customers to buy cars online, car companies will have to radically streamline their dealership networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;“The cake will be smaller,” said Volkmar Denner, the chief executive of Bosch, the auto parts maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Established carmakers will face new competitors taking advantage of the technology shift to break into the market. &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/business/china-hastens-the-world-toward-an-electric-car-future.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot;&gt;Chinese companies are investing heavily in electric cars&lt;/a&gt;. Dyson, a British company hitherto known for its innovative vacuum cleaners, has &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/automobiles/wheels/startup-car-markers.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot;&gt;announced plans to develop an electric car&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Big car companies recognize the threat and argue that they can deploy their enormous manufacturing networks to roll out electric vehicles faster than Tesla, which has struggled to meet demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;“We won’t have a problem building one million cars,” said Herbert Diess, chief executive of the division that makes Volkswagen brand cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;But the automakers’ existing expertise — building internal combustion engines — will no longer give them a competitive edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;“They are losing a lot of their intellectual capital,” said Geoffrey Heal, a professor at Columbia Business School. “And they have to find a way to replace it.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Building a Poor Man’s Deep Learning Camera in Python</title>
<link>https://www.makeartwithpython.com/blog/poor-mans-deep-learning-camera/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.makeartwithpython.com/blog/poor-mans-deep-learning-camera/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.makeartwithpython.com/blog/assets/images/deep-lens/deep-learning-camera.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon has just announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/deeplens/&quot;&gt;DeepLens&lt;/a&gt;, a smart webcam that uses machine learning to detect objects, faces, and activities like playing a guitar on the camera itself. The DeepLens isn’t available yet, but the idea of a smart camera is exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine being able to use a camera that’s able to tell when you’re playing a guitar, or creating a new dance, or just learning new skateboard tricks. It could use the raw image data to tell if you landed a trick or not. Or if you’re doing a new dance routine, what the series of poses are, and how they fit to the music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we’ll build a deep learning camera that detects when there are birds present in the webcam image, and then saves a photo of the bird. The end result gives us images like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.makeartwithpython.com/blog/assets/images/deep-lens/1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Detected Bird Image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.makeartwithpython.com/blog/assets/images/deep-lens/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.makeartwithpython.com/blog/assets/images/deep-lens/2.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Detected Bird Image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.makeartwithpython.com/blog/assets/images/deep-lens/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.makeartwithpython.com/blog/assets/images/deep-lens/3.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Detected Bird Image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.makeartwithpython.com/blog/assets/images/deep-lens/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Detected images including birds from the deep learning camera
&lt;p&gt;Deep learning cameras are the beginning of a whole new platform for machine learning computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DeepLens has 100 GFlops of computational power available for inference, which is just the beginning of the computational power necessary for an interesting deep learning camera computer. In the future, these devices will get much more powerful, and allow for inferring hundreds of images a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But who wants to wait for the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dumb-camera-smart-inference&quot;&gt;Dumb Camera, Smart Inference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of building a deep learning model into our camera, we’ll use a “dumb” camera computer at the edge (like a $9 Raspberry Pi), hook it up to a webcam, and then send the images over WiFi. At the tradeoff of a bit more latency, we can build a prototype of the same DeepLens concept today, much cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in today’s post, we’ll do just that. We’ll write a web server in Python to send images from a Raspberry Pi to another computer for inference, or image detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.makeartwithpython.com/blog/assets/images/deep-lens/deeplens.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other computer with more processing power will then use a neural network architecture called &lt;a href=&quot;https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/&quot;&gt;“YOLO”&lt;/a&gt; to do detection on that input image, and tell if there’s a bird in the camera frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll start with the YOLO architecture, because it’s one of the fastest detection models around. And there is a port of its model to Tensorflow, which is very easy to install and get running on many different platforms. As a bonus, if you use the Tiny model we use in this post, you’ll also be able to do detection on a CPU, no expensive GPU needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to our prototype. If there is a bird detected in the camera frame, we’ll save that image for later analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just the beginning of a truly intelligent deep learning camera, and terribly basic, but you’ve got to start from somewhere. So let’s jump in, and get the first version of our prototype our the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;detection-vs-imaging&quot;&gt;Detection vs Imaging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.makeartwithpython.com/blog/assets/images/deep-lens/1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Detected Bird Image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.makeartwithpython.com/blog/assets/images/deep-lens/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.makeartwithpython.com/blog/assets/images/deep-lens/labeled/0.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Labeled Bird Image. Notice the wrong label 'bicycle'.&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.makeartwithpython.com/blog/assets/images/deep-lens/labeled/0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Detected and Labeled Birds
&lt;p&gt;As we’ve already said, the DeepLens’ imaging is built right into the computer. So it can do base level detection, and determine if the images coming in match your criteria or not with the onboard computational power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with something like a Raspberry Pi, we won’t necessarily have the computational power necessary to do onboard detection in real time. So instead, we’re going to use another computer to do the inference of what’s in the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I used a base, simple Linux computer with a webcam and wifi access (&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2B1ZEV2&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi 3&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2Crwtqv&quot;&gt;cheap webcam&lt;/a&gt;), to act a server for my deep learning machine to do inference from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good stack, because it allows for keeping many cheaper cameras in the wild, and doing all my computation in one place, on my desktop machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;webcam-image-server-stack&quot;&gt;Webcam Image Server Stack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t want to use the Raspberry Pi camera, you can install OpenCV 3 on your Raspberry Pi &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/09/04/raspbian-stretch-install-opencv-3-python-on-your-raspberry-pi/&quot;&gt;using these instructions&lt;/a&gt;, although substitute OpenCV version 3.3.1 for 3.3.0 in the instructions to get the latest version installed locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a sidenote, I had to disable CAROTENE compilation in order to get 3.3.1 on my Raspberry Pi. You may need to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once that’s done, we just need to set up our web server in Flask, so we can load the images from the webcam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve used &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/flask-video-streaming-revisited&quot;&gt;Miguel Grinberg’s&lt;/a&gt; excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flask-video-streaming&quot;&gt;webcam server code&lt;/a&gt; as a starting place, and created just a simple jpg endpoint instead of a motion jpeg endpoint:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot;Returns a single current image for the webcam&quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'__main__'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'0.0.0.0'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;threaded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to use the Raspberry Pi video camera, make sure you uncomment the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;from camera_pi&lt;/code&gt; line, and comment out the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;from camera_opencv&lt;/code&gt; line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get this server running with just a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;python3 app.py&lt;/code&gt;, or using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gunicorn&lt;/code&gt;, the same as is mentioned in Miguel’s post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just uses Miguel’s excellent camera management to turn off the camera when there aren’t requests coming in, and also manages threads, if we have more than one machine doing inference on the images coming in from the webcam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we’ve started it on our Raspberry Pi, we can test and make sure the server works by first discovering it’s IP address, and then attempting to reach it via our web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The URL should be something like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://192.168.1.4:5000/image.jpg&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.makeartwithpython.com/blog/assets/images/deep-lens/success.png&quot;/&gt; Load the web page of the Raspberry Pi to confirm the image server works.
&lt;h2 id=&quot;pulling-images-and-doing-inferences-from-the-camera-server&quot;&gt;Pulling Images and Doing Inferences from the Camera Server&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve got an endpoint to load the webcam’s current image from, we can build the script to grab and run inference on those images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;requests&lt;/code&gt;, the great Python library for grabbing files from URLs, along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow/&quot;&gt;Darkflow&lt;/a&gt;, an implementation of the YOLO models on Tensorflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there isn’t a pip wheel for installing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow/&quot;&gt;Darkflow&lt;/a&gt;, so we’ll need to clone the repo, and then build and install it ourselves on the computer that will be doing our inferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After installing the Darkflow repo, we’ll also need to download the weights and model of a version of YOLO we’ll be using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I used the YOLO v2 tiny network, as I wanted to run my inference on a slower computer, using the onboard CPU, not the GPU in my main desktop. The tiny network comes with the tradeoff of less accuracy than the full YOLO v2 model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this built and downloaded, we’ll also need &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Pillow&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;numpy&lt;/code&gt;, and OpenCV installed on the detection computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can finally write our code to run detection:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;cv2&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;io&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BytesIO&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'running again'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this, we have a very basic first version of our detection running. We can see in the console for our Raspberry Pi what’s being detected, and we can also see each of the birds being seen saved on to our hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, we can run a program to do labeling on the images YOLO has detected birds in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;balance-more-false-positives-or-more-false-negatives&quot;&gt;Balance: More False Positives or More False Negatives?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing to take note of, our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;threshold&lt;/code&gt; key in the options dictionary we created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This threshold says what confidence level we need to have at a minimum to say we’ve detected what we’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For testing purposes, I’ve set it to be 0.1. But this low of a threshold will give us a lot of false positives. Worse still, the Tiny YOLO model we’ve used for detection is less accurate than the real YOLO model, and so we’ll have a fair bit of wrong detections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowering or raising the threshold can improve or lower the total output of your model, depending on what you’re trying to build. In my case, I’m fine with more false positives, but I really prefer to get more images of birds than less. You may need to tweak these parameters to match your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;waiting-for-the-birds&quot;&gt;Waiting for the Birds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting birds into my bird feeder took a long time. I figured I’d have birds in the backyard for my feeder within hours of putting out food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, it took a few days. Squirrels kept eating the food I’d left out, and it seemed for the first few days I hardly saw a bird in the sky at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I broke down and got a second bird feeder, one that was a bit more visible and off the ground. With this, I finally started getting some images like the ones at the beginning of the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-to-go-from-here&quot;&gt;Where to Go from Here&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code for this post is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/burningion/poor-mans-deep-learning-camera&quot;&gt;available at Github&lt;/a&gt;, as always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because so much of this post itself was just combining other previous work, there isn’t really much to it. A huge debt is owed to both Miguel Grinberg’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/flask-video-streaming-revisited&quot;&gt;Flask streaming video example&lt;/a&gt;, and to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow&quot;&gt;Darkflow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pjreddie.com/darknet/&quot;&gt;Darknet&lt;/a&gt; for the deep learning models used for detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is the beginning of a set of lessons where I will use deep learning cameras to try and interact with birds.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Update: Looking Glass Add-On</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/update-looking-glass-add/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/update-looking-glass-add/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We didn’t think hard enough about how our actions would affect the community, and we’re sorry for letting you down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we got here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the year Firefox has enjoyed a growing relationship with the Mr. Robot television show and, as part of this relationship, we developed an unpaid collaboration to engage our users and viewers of the show in a new way: Fans could use Firefox to solve a puzzle as part of the alternate reality game (ARG) associated with the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did it work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fans of the show enabled this game in Firefox by turning on the “Looking Glass” add-on effect via preferences setting. When enabled, and the user navigated to Mr. Robot’s ARG page, a clue necessary to advance the puzzle would be revealed.  When enabled, the add-on would also invert text from a list of words related to the shows themes, throughout the web for a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of giving users the choice to install this add-on, we initially pushed an update to Firefox that installed the “Looking Glass” add-on for English speaking users. This add-on was installed and set to ‘OFF’ and made no changes in the user experience unless it was explicitly turned on by a user, but it was added. Even when turned on no user data was collected or shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rollout did not meet the standards to which we hold ourselves causing concern that was surfaced through our Firefox community. We received feedback regarding the transparency of the rollout and the processes that govern our auto-install mechanism for add-ons. In response we immediately started our internal review, updated the add-on with a better description and began the process to move the Mr. Robot &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/looking-glass/&quot;&gt;Looking Glass tie-in&lt;/a&gt; to the add-ons site as a regular WebExtension. We also shared the source in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/mozilla/addon-wr&quot;&gt;public repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To our community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re sorry for the confusion and for letting down members of our community. While there was no intention or mechanism to collect or share your data or private information and The Looking Glass was an opt-in and user activated promotion, we should have given users the choice to install this add-on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being thorough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recognize that real engagement means listening to feedback. We took immediate actions to correct this, and we are conducting a formal internal review to ensure our technical, legal and communications processes and policies are updated for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We take seriously our responsibility to provide a trusted, secure platform for your online life and will always work to maintain the trust of our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re doing a post-mortem and are going to make changes to our processes. These will be public and we will link to a public list of process changes, likely mid-January.&lt;/p&gt;

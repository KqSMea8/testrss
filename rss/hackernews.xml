<title>Orchid: a new surveillance-free layer on top of the existing Internet</title>
<link>http://orchidprotocol.com</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://orchidprotocol.com</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We are working on techniques involving &quot;traffic steganography&quot; that will make the the traffic used by Orchid look like &quot;normal&quot; internet traffic (such as web requests and video calls). There are also existing simpler techniques such as &quot;domain fronting&quot;, where you send your traffic to a large company such as Amazon--one which uses a CDN to efficiently route traffic--and cause their CDN to forward your traffic to your servers; this has been used successfully against the Great Firewall of China in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we also need to hide the list of destination servers, as otherwise these could be collected by the adversary and blocked outright. Our current solution to this involves cycling through large numbers of random IP addresses on various hosting solutions, which we believe will force anyone trying to block our traffic to end up blocking large areas of the internet--such as every server being hosted on Amazon Web Services--which would cause a serious problem for Chinese business people, deeply affecting commerce, as well as quality of life for the average Chinese citizen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information on this, see our discussion of Firewall Circumvention Features in our whitepaper.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Crystal in Production: Diploid</title>
<link>https://crystal-lang.org/2017/10/27/diploid-and-crystal.html</link>

<description>&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10.969957081545&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This guest post is an interview that Ivo Balbaert had with Peter Schols from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diploid.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diploid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about their Crystal in Production story. This interview will also be part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pragprog.com/book/crystal/crystal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programming Crystal&lt;/strong&gt; book&lt;/a&gt; that Ivo is writting - and we can’t wait to read!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’d like to thank both of them for taking the time to share their experience, and to invite any other companies or individuals using Crystal in a production environment to share theirs too - &lt;a href=&quot;https://crystal-lang.org/community/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reach out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if you’d like to!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diploid.com/&quot;&gt;Diploid&lt;/a&gt;, we have been using Crystal for quite some time now. We would like to share our experience in this interview, answering questions relevant to companies wanting to use Crystal for production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diploid is a company based in Leuven, Belgium. We provides services and software to hospitals and labs for diagnosing rare diseases using clinical genome analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are using Crystal for parts of Moon, the first software package to autonomously diagnose rare disease using artificial intelligence. Moon is being used by hospitals worldwide to diagnose patients with severe genetic conditions. The software requires the patient’s symptoms, as well as his/her genome data. It will then come up with the most likely mutation to explain the patient’s condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Moon, geneticists had to manually filter and rank mutations using special software in order to reach a diagnosis. This process can take several hours up to several days. Moon does the filtering and ranking automatically and proposes a diagnosis within 3 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moon has been written mostly in Ruby. We’ve chosen Ruby for several reasons: rapid development, expressive syntax, lots of available libraries and a great ecosystem. All of this results in developer happiness and faster development cycles. But while Ruby is fast enough for most parts of Moon, it can be slow for the most performance critical areas of our codebase. That’s why we evaluated Crystal, among others, and eventually decided to develop in Crystal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://crystal-lang.org/assets/blog/diploid-moon.png&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking for a language that we could use to replace performance critical code in our Ruby codebase, we evaluated many options: Swift, Elixir, Go and Crystal. We specifically evaluated performance, syntax and ease-of-use. Performance was assessed using a small benchmark script that includes the performance critical operations that are typical for genome analysis (mostly string operations). Go topped the performance list, followed by Crystal. Surprisingly, Ruby outperformed Swift. Go clearly won the performance criterium. Performance is not everything, however: infrastructure is very cheap compared to developer time. While Go is an interesting language with a great concurrency model, it lacks in several other areas. Features that we take for granted in Ruby or other languages, are not available in Go. Examples include operator overloading or keyword extensibility, as well as true OOP. Moving from Ruby to Go sometimes feels like ignoring 20 years of progress made in language design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crystal, as the second best performer, combines this still excellent performance with a very Ruby-like syntax. Given that the rest of our code base has been written in Ruby, it’s a great match. Moreover, Crystal has a Go-like concurrency model, so it basically takes the best from the Ruby world (expressive syntax, full OOP) and combines it with the best of Go (concurrency model, performance).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any problem that is currently being solved by Ruby, Python, Go or Rust could potentially be solved in Crystal. Given its similarity to Ruby, web frameworks will be an important part of the Crystal ecosystem. However, Crystal has a lot of potential in other fields too. Python is popular in data science, but it’s far from the fastest language. With Crystal, data scientists could have the ease-of-use of Python/Ruby combined with the performance of C. These advantages could make Crystal very suitable for domains like bioinformatics, where performance is really important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many people in the bioinformatics field don’t have a formal CS/engineering background, having a language that is easy to learn is important as well. Crystal does very well on both fronts. In addition, due to its expressive nature and low barrier to entry - traits it inherited from Ruby - Crystal is a great tool for general scripting and systems software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When coming from Ruby, working in Crystal feels like coming home. Syntactically, Crystal is highly similar: the only major difference is the static typing. While this takes a bit to get used to, the transition was really smooth and easy. Many lines of code can literally be copied from a Ruby project and pasted into a Crystal project and they will just work. Some lines do need additional type annotations, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from that, the only major difference is that the rubygems (Ruby libraries) ecosystem is very expansive. Crystal has its own version of gems, called shards. While the number of shards has grown exponentially in the past few months, it’s still way behind the rubygems ecosystem, or the Go ecosystem for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Crystal code we use in production was not ported from Ruby, it was written from scratch in Crystal. However, in order to test the difference in performance - and also out of pure curiosity - we ported the code from Crystal to Ruby. For this particular project, we noticed that the Crystal version was 4.4x - 6.1x faster. This made a big difference in user experience. It means that for smaller data sets, Moon can present results in near real time (about 540 ms), which feels instant to the user. The corresponding Ruby program takes 2.5 seconds for the same task. When analysing larger data sets, the difference was even bigger: on average 27 seconds for Crystal compared to 2 minutes and 50 seconds for almost exactly the same Ruby code, a more than 6x speedup! When analysing hundreds of samples, these time differences become even more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, the speed increase is really significant. In addition, the ability to create a binary is convenient, as it allows for easy deployment. Compiling a binary also allows us to easily share software with our internal users and testers. With Ruby, we need to setup rvm or rbenv, install the latest Ruby version, install rubygems and install all required gems. With Crystal, it’s as easy as copying one file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performance, the ability to create real binaries and the Ruby-like syntax are the most important Crystal selling points for me. Another advantage is that Crystal makes it very easy to create bindings to a C library - no need to write C code. Last but not least, Crystal has an amazing community of friendly and skilled developers. It started with Ary, Juan and Brian at Manas, creating the language and helping the Crystal newbies. In the meantime, it seems like the entire community has copied their attitude of providing help and pointers to everyone who’s interested in this very promising language.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Can You Afford It? Real-World Web Performance Budgets</title>
<link>https://infrequently.org/2017/10/can-you-afford-it-real-world-web-performance-budgets/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://infrequently.org/2017/10/can-you-afford-it-real-world-web-performance-budgets/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: performance budgets are an essential but under-appreciated part of product success and team health. Most partners we work with are not aware of the real-world operating environment and make inappropriate technology choices as a result. We set a budget in &lt;strong&gt;time&lt;/strong&gt; of &amp;lt;= 5 seconds first-load &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/time-to-interactive&quot;&gt;Time-to-Interactive&lt;/a&gt; and &amp;lt;= 2s for subsequent loads. We constrain ourselves to a real-world baseline device + network configuration to measure progress. The default global baseline is a ~$200 Android device on a 400Kbps link with a 400ms round-trip-time (“RTT”). This translates into a budget of ~130-170KB of critical-path resources, depending on composition — the more JS you include, the smaller the bundle must be.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve had the pleasure of working with dozens of teams over the past few years. This work has been illuminating, sometimes in very unexpected ways. One of the most surprising results has been the frequent occurrence of &lt;em&gt;“ambush by JavaScript”&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;We need a new term for the business-opportunity wastage that modern front-end development has created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe &quot;ambush by JS&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Alex Russell (@slightlylate) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/slightlylate/status/915617755675504640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 4, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business leaders who green-light the development of Progressive Web Apps frequently cite the ability to reach new users with near-zero friction as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbespr/2017/03/07/forbes-launches-all-new-mobile-web-experience-for-forbes-com/#62db39375168&quot;&gt;primary motivator&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, teams are reaching for tools which make achieving this goal impossible. Nobody is trying to do a poor job, and yet the results of a “completed” PWA project often require weeks or months of painstaking rework to deliver minimally acceptable performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rework delays launches which, in turn, delays gathering data about the viability of a PWA strategy. Teams we aren’t able to work with directly sometimes do not catch these problems until it’s too late, launching experiences which are simply unusable for a majority of potential users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setting A Baseline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teams that avoid unpleasant surprises tend to share a few traits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Executive sponsors are enthusiastic. They use “do what it takes” language to describe the efforts to get and stay fast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance budgets are set early in the life of the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Budgets are scaled to a benchmark network &amp;amp; device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tools and CI systems help them monitor progress &amp;amp; prevent regressions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;These properties build on each other: it’s difficult to get the space you need to plan to do things well without decision makers who value user experience and long-term business value. Teams with this support are free to set performance budgets, do “bakeoffs” between competing approaches, and invest in performance infrastructure. They’re also more able to go against the “industry standard” grain when popular tools prove to be inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance budgets keep everyone on the same page and create a culture of shared enthusiasm for improving the lived user experience. Teams with budgets also find it easier to track and graph progress. This helps support executive sponsors who then have meaningful metrics to point to in justifying the investments being made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budgets set an &lt;em&gt;objective frame&lt;/em&gt; for determining which changes to the codebase represent progress and which are regressions from the user perspective. Without them it’s impossible to avoid slipping into the trap of pretending you can afford more than you can. Very rarely have we seen a team succeed that doesn’t set budgets, gather RUM metrics, and carry representative customer devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partner meetings are illuminating. We get a strong sense for how bad site performance is going to be based on the percentage of engineering leads, PMs, and decision makers carrying high-end phones which they primarily use in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telecompetitor.com/report-u-s-rural-mobile-broadband-speeds-are-20-9-slower-than-urban/&quot;&gt;urban areas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing better by users involves 2 phases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Challenging assumptions &amp;amp; growing understanding of real-world conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automating testing against an objective baseline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never before have front-end teams enjoyed access to such good performance tools and diagnostic techniques, yet poor results are the norm. What’s going on here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JS Is Your Most Expensive Asset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One distinct trend is a belief that a JavaScript framework and Single-Page Architecture (SPA) is a must for PWA development. This isn’t true (more on that in a follow-up post), and sites which are built this way implicitly require more script in each document (e.g., for router components). We regularly see sites loading more than 500KB of script (compressed). This matters because all script loading delays the metric we value most: &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/time-to-interactive&quot;&gt;Time to Interactive&lt;/a&gt;. Sites with this much script are simply &lt;em&gt;inaccessible&lt;/em&gt; to a broad swath of the world’s users; statistically, users do not (and will not) wait for these experiences to load. Those that do experience horrendous jank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re often asked “what’s the big deal about 200KB of JS, some of our images are that size?” A good question! Answering it requires an understanding of how browsers process resources (which differs by type) and the concept of &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/optimizing-critical-rendering-path&quot;&gt;the critical path&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A-2BhEZiM4&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;For a timely introduction, I recommended Kevin Schaaf’s recent talk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lx1cYJAVnzA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;yt-embed&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;Late-loading JavaScript can cause “server-side rendered” pages to fail in infuriating ways. This uncanny-valley effect is the reason we focus on when pages become reliably interactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider a page like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;/styles.css&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;script src=&quot;/app.js&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;my-app&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;picture slot=&quot;hero-image&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;source srcset=&quot;img@desktop.png, img@desktop-2x.png 2x&quot;&lt;br /&gt;media=&quot;(min-width: 990px)&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;source srcset=&quot;img@tablet.png, img@tablet-2x.png 2x&quot;&lt;br /&gt;media=&quot;(min-width: 750px)&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;img srcset=&quot;img@mobile.png, img@mobile-2x.png 2x&quot;&lt;br /&gt;alt=&quot;I don't know why. It's a perfectly cromunlent word!&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/picture&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/my-app&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The browser encounters this document in response for a GET request to &lt;code&gt;https://example.com/&lt;/code&gt;. The server sends it as a stream of bytes and when the browser encounters each of the sub-resources referenced in the document, it requests them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this page to be done loading it needs to be responsive to user input — the “interactive” in &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/time-to-interactive&quot;&gt;“Time to Interactive”&lt;/a&gt;. Browsers process user input by generating DOM events that application code listens to. This input processing happens on document’s &lt;em&gt;main thread&lt;/em&gt;, where JavaScript runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some operations that can happen on other threads, allowing the browser to stay responsive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Parsing HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parsing CSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parsing and compiling JavaScript (sometimes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some JS garbage collection tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parsing and rasterizing images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GPU-accelerated CSS transformations and animations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Main-document scrolling (assuming no active touch listeners)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These operations, however, &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; happen on the main thread:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Execution of JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Construction of DOM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Layout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Processing input (including scrolling w/ active touch listeners)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If our example document wasn’t reliant on JavaScript to construct the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;my-app&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; custom element, the contents of the document would likely be interactive as soon as enough CSS and content was available to render meaningfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Script execution delays interactivity in a few ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the script executes for more than 50ms, time-to-interactive is delayed by the &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; amount of time it takes to download, compile, and execute the JS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any DOM or UI created in JS is not available for use until the script runs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Images, on the other hand, do not block the main thread, do not block interaction when parsed or rasterized, and do not prevent other parts of the UI from getting or staying interactive. Therefore, while a 150KB image won’t appreciably increase TTI, 150KB of JS will delay interactivity by the time required to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Request the code, including DNS, TCP, HTTP, and decompression overhead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parse and compile the top-level functions of the JS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute the script&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These steps are largely serialized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If script execution could stay under 50ms for a bundle this large, TTI would not be delayed, but that’s not feasible. 150KB of gzipped JavaScript expands to roughly 1MB of code, and as &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/reloading/javascript-start-up-performance-69200f43b201&quot;&gt;Addy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wHcNNQea28LhwQ_amFamT33d5woVrJfJy53Z1k6V090/edit#gid=1882596388&quot;&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt;, that’s going to take more than a second on most of the world’s phones &lt;em&gt;not including the time to fetch it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is the &lt;em&gt;single most&lt;/em&gt; expensive part of any page in ways that are a function of both network capacity and device speed. For developers and decision makers with fast phones on fast networks this is a double-whammy of hidden costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Global Ground-Truth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deciding what benchmark to use for a performance budget is crucial. Some teams and businesses know their audience intimately and can make informed estimates about the devices and networks current and prospective users are on. Most, however, do not have such a baseline easily to-hand. Where to start?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two numbers set the stage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The median user is on a slow network&lt;/em&gt;. Just how slow is a matter of some debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our metrics at Google show a conflicted picture (which I’m working to get to clarity on). Some systems show median RTTs near ~100ms for 3G users. Others show the median user unable to transmit and receive an individual packet in less than 400ms in some major markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest we should be conservative. &lt;a href=&quot;http://frankrayal.com/2011/06/27/lte-peak-capacity/&quot;&gt;Contended, over-subscribed cells&lt;/a&gt; can make “fast” networks brutally slow, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs.nyu.edu/~jchen/publications/sigcomm15-zaki.pdf&quot;&gt;transport variance can make TCP much less efficient&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~hjx/file/sigcomm13.pdf&quot;&gt;bursty nature of web traffic works against us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Googlers enjoy access to a simulated “degraded 3G” network to help validate the behaviour of their apps under these conditions. It simulates a link with a 400ms RTT and 400-600Kbps of throughput (plus latency variability and simulated packet loss). Given the conflicted data we see across our other systems, this seems about right as a baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simulated packet loss and variable latency, however, can make benchmarking extremely difficult and slow. The effect of a lost packet during DNS lookup can be a difference of &lt;em&gt;seconds&lt;/em&gt;, making it frustrating to compare before/after for changes at development time. Our baseline, then, should probably trade lower throughput/higher-latency for packet loss. What we lose in real-world fidelity, we gain in repeatability and the ability to compare across changes and across products. There’s much, much more to say about the effects of DNS, TLS, network topology, and other factors. For those who want to go deeper on this, I highly recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://hpbn.co/&quot;&gt;Ilya Grigorik’s “High Performance Browser Networking”&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://hpbn.co/mobile-networks/#radio-resource-controller-rrc&quot;&gt;coverage of RRC&lt;/a&gt; alone makes it worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to our baseline, we now have a sense for what our simulated network conditions should be: &lt;em&gt;400ms RTT, 400Kbps bandwidth&lt;/em&gt;. What about the device itself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last year’s Chrome Dev Summit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bZvq3nodf4&quot;&gt;I discussed some of the thermal and power-limiting factors that create a huge disparity between desktop and mobile device performance&lt;/a&gt;. Add onto that the yawning chasm between low-end and high-end device performance thanks to chip design factors like cache sizes, and it can be difficult to know where to set a device baseline. Thankfully, this is somewhat easier than network speeds: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/comscore-reports-february-2017-us-smartphone-subscriber-market-share-300437639.html&quot;&gt;more than half of &lt;em&gt;American&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; mobile users are on Android devices. As you look abroad, worldwide smartphone shipments &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/os&quot;&gt;are (and for the past 5 years have been) overwhelmingly Android-based&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/283334/global-average-selling-price-smartphones/&quot;&gt;The average selling price for those devices is &lt;em&gt;falling&lt;/em&gt; in most geographies&lt;/a&gt;, driven by the ubiquity of Androids and &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2016/02/15/apple-android-asps/&quot;&gt;relentless price drops within that ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;. This, in turn, drives the single most important trend in setting the global web performance budget hardware baseline: the next billion users will largely come online &lt;em&gt;when they can afford to&lt;/em&gt;. This will drive declines in smartphone average-selling-price (“ASP”) in emerging markets for the foreseeable future. This, in turn, means that all improvements to transistor-count-per-dollar will translate into &lt;em&gt;lower selling prices&lt;/em&gt;, not faster devices (on average).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The true median device from 2016 sold at about ~$200 unlocked. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS42334717&quot;&gt;This year’s median device is even cheaper&lt;/a&gt;, but their performance is &lt;em&gt;roughly equivalent&lt;/em&gt;. Expect performance continued stasis at the median for the next few years. This is part of the reason I &lt;a href=&quot;https://building.calibreapp.com/beyond-the-bubble-real-world-performance-9c991dcd5342&quot;&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_g4-8103.php&quot;&gt;Moto G4&lt;/a&gt; last year and recommend it or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_g5_plus-8453.php&quot;&gt;Moto G5 Plus&lt;/a&gt; this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting it all together, our global baseline for performance benchmarking is a:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;~$200 (new, unlocked) Android phone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On a slow 3G network, emulated at:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;400ms RTT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;400Kbps transfer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most technologists, building applications for this environment might as well be farming on Mars. Luckily, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/webpagetest/blob/6a79fedb6bb5792f11d2891d9ae80f8ffb8b1a7d/www/settings/connectivity.ini.sample#L61&quot;&gt;this configuration&lt;/a&gt; is available on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webpagetest.org/easy&quot;&gt;webpagetest.org/easy&lt;/a&gt;, meaning we can re-create these conditions here on earth, any time we like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Affordability Calculation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last thing we need for our perf budget is &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;. How long is too long?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like Monica’s definition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Monica Perf Test™: if you wouldn't make eye contact with a stranger for the time it takes your web app to first paint, it's too slow.✌️💫&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Monica Dinculescu (@notwaldorf) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/notwaldorf/status/778248810371747840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 20, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…but that’s more qualitative than quantitative. Numerically, we’d prefer &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; page load occur in under a second (&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rail&quot;&gt;see RAIL&lt;/a&gt;). That’s not possible on real-world networks, so we’ve set the following &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/time-to-interactive&quot;&gt;Time-to-Interactive (TTI) metric&lt;/a&gt; goal with partners:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;TTI under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/articles/mobile-speed-matters/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;5 seconds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for first load&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TTI under &lt;em&gt;2 seconds&lt;/em&gt; for subsequent loads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now have everything we need to create a ballpark perf budget for a product in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;First Load&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working backwards from time, network conditions, and the primary stages of the critical path, we get a few interesting results. We can start with our first-load budget of 5 seconds and begin to calculate how much transfer we can afford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we subtract 1.6 seconds from our budgets for DNS lookup and TLS handshaking, leaving us 3.4s to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we calculate how much data we can send over this link in 3.4 seconds: 400 Kbps = 50KB/s. 50KB/s * 3.4 = &lt;em&gt;170KB&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: This discussion is sure to infuriate competent network engineers. Previous versions of this article discussed &lt;a href=&quot;https://hpbn.co/building-blocks-of-tcp/#bandwidth-delay-product&quot;&gt;slow-start, bdp, tcp window scaling, and the like&lt;/a&gt;. They were commensurately difficult to follow. Simplifying has relatively little impact on the overall story, so those details are elided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern web applications are largely composed of JS, meaning we also need to subtract the amount of time the JS needs to parse and evaluate. The gzip compression factor for JS code is between 5x and 7x. 170KB of JS then becomes ~850KB-1MB of JS which, based on earlier estimates, may take a second to run (presuming it doesn’t do any expensive DOM work, which of course it will). Playing with these numbers a little bit, we can get back below 3.4s of download and eval by limiting ourselves to 130KB of JS transferred on the wire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last wrench in the works: if any of our critical-path resources come from a different origin (e.g., a CDN), we need to subtract connection setup time for that origin (~1.6s) from the budget, further limiting how much of our 5s we actually get to can spend on network transfer and client-side work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting it all together, under ideal conditions, our rough budget for critical-path resources (CSS, JS, HTML, and data) at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;170KB&lt;/em&gt; for sites without much JS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;130KB&lt;/em&gt; for sites built with JS frameworks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This gives us the ability to consider the single most pressing question in front-end development today: &lt;em&gt;“can you afford it?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if your JS framework takes ~40KB of transfer on a JS-heavy site (which gets a budget of 130KB thanks to JS eval time), you’re left with only 90KB of “headroom”. Your entire app must fit into that space. A 100KB framework loaded from a CDN &lt;em&gt;is already 20KB over budget&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think back: your framework of choice might be 40K, but what about that data system? The router you added? Suddenly 130KB doesn’t seem like a lot when you also need to include data, templates, and styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living on a budget means constantly asking yourself “can I really afford this?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Second Load&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, all page loads happen in under a second, but for many reasons that’s often not feasible. Therefore we’re going to give ourselves a bit of a breather and budget 2 seconds for second (third, fourth, etc.) load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not 5? Because we shouldn’t need to ever go to the network to get our app’s UI booted once we’ve visited it the first time. &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/&quot;&gt;Service Workers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://offlinefirst.org/&quot;&gt;“offline first”&lt;/a&gt; architectures enables us to put interactive pixels on screen without ever touching the network. This is the key to achieving &lt;a href=&quot;https://infrequently.org/2016/05/service-workers-and-pwas-its-about-reliable-performance-not-offline/&quot;&gt;reliable performance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two seconds is &lt;em&gt;forever&lt;/em&gt; in modern CPU terms, but we still need to spend it wisely. Factors we need to account for include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Process creation time (Android is relatively slow vs. other OSes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time required to read bytes from disk (it’s not zero, even on flash-based storage!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time to execute and run our code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every app I’ve seen that hits a 5s initial load and implements offline-first correctly stays under this 2s budget, and sub 1s is possible! But getting to offline-first is a huge challenge for many teams. Architecting to save last-seen user data locally, cache app resources in a reliable and coherent way, and juggle application code upgrades using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/lifecycle&quot;&gt;Service Worker lifecycle&lt;/a&gt; can be a major undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m looking forward to tools continuing to evolve in this area. The most comprehensive bootstrap I know of today is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/toolbox/&quot;&gt;Polymer App Toolbox&lt;/a&gt;, so if you’re not sure where to start, start there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;130-170KB…Surely You’re Kidding!?!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many teams we talk to wonder if it’s even possible to deliver something useful in as little as 130KB. It is! the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/toolbox/prpl&quot;&gt;PRPL pattern&lt;/a&gt; shows the way through aggressive code-splitting based on route awareness, Service Worker caching of granular (subsequent-page) resources, and clever use of modern protocol enhancements like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2_Server_Push&quot;&gt;HTTP/2 Push&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these tools &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webpagetest.org/video/compare.php?tests=171009_XR_4af2434b042e8ded9256ce3de39e5345-r%3A1-c%3A0&amp;amp;thumbSize=200&amp;amp;ival=100&amp;amp;end=full&quot;&gt;enable us to deliver functional, modern experiences in under 100KB for the critical path&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, it’s still sort of difficult to tell from a specific trace which parts of the page load are critical-path resources for TTI and which aren’t, but I’m optimistic that tools will evolve quickly to help us understand this key metric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, we know it’s possible, even without giving up on frameworks entirely. Both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wego.com&quot;&gt;Wego&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://h5.ele.me/msite/&quot;&gt;Ele.me&lt;/a&gt; are built with modern tools (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polymer-project.org/&quot;&gt;Polymer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuejs.org/&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/a&gt;, respectively) and help users complete real transactions &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;. Most apps are &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; complex than they are. Life on a budget isn’t starvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools for Teams on a Budget&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting under-budget &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; hard, but the benefits to the business and to users are immense. Less often discussed are the benefits to engineering teams and their leaders. No tech-lead or PM wants to be on the wrong side of an executive who walks into their area with a phone asking “so why is this so slow when I’m on vacation?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t theoretical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen teams that have just finished re-building on a modern tech stack cringe for an hour as we walk them through the experience of using their “better”, “faster” experiences under real-world conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everyone&lt;/em&gt; loses face when the product fails to meet expectations. Months of unplanned performance fire-fighting delay the addition of new features and have a draining effect on team morale. When performance becomes a crisis, mid-level managers get caught between being the “shit umbrella” their teams count on and crushing self doubt. Worse, they may begin to doubt their team. The other side of a performance crisis is a long road; how can the organisation trust the team to deliver a quality product? Can they trust the TLs to recommend new technology or large re-investments? Recriminations follow. This is a &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; experience, specifically for developers who are too often on the receiving end of incredible pressure to “fix it”, ASAP — and “it” may be a core technology the product is built on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the worst cases, the product may be unfixable on a short enough timeframe to help the business. A lot of progress is Darwinian and for startups and small teams, betting on the wrong stack without the benefit of a long runway can be fatal. Worse, this can go un-diagnosed for a long, long time. If the whole team carries the latest iOS devices on fast, urban networks and the product’s economics are premised on growing a broad-based audience, the failure of that audience to arrive barely makes a sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance isn’t the (entire) product, of course. Lots of slow or market-limited products do incredibly well. Having a unique service that people want (and will go out of their way for) can override all of these other concerns. Some folks even succeed in App Stores where friction-to-acquire an experience is &lt;em&gt;intense&lt;/em&gt;. But products in competitive marketplaces need every advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some specific tools and techniques can help teams that adopt a performance budget:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webpagetest.org/easy&quot;&gt;webpagetest.org/easy&lt;/a&gt;: this is our go-to tool for one-off analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/a/webpagetest.org/docs/using-webpagetest/scripting&quot;&gt;WPT scripting&lt;/a&gt;: for teams that don’t want to set up a custom WPT instance and have public URLs for their WIP apps, integrating with WPT scripting can be a great way to get regular “checks”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/a/webpagetest.org/docs/private-instances&quot;&gt;WPT private instances&lt;/a&gt;: teams that want to integrate WPT directly into their CI or commit-queue systems should investigate setting up a private WPT server and hardware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/#programmatic&quot;&gt;Scripted Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;: not ready for a full WPT instance? Scripting Lighthouse can help your CI automate analysis of your site and catch regressions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tkadlec/grunt-perfbudget&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;grunt-perfbudget&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an even-easier, automated WPT testing for your CI. Use it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://speedcurve.com/&quot;&gt;Speedcurve&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://calibreapp.com/&quot;&gt;Calibre&lt;/a&gt;: these hosted services automate tracking performance over time, delivering an outstanding real-world gut-check&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://webpack.js.org/configuration/performance/&quot;&gt;Webpack Performance Budgets&lt;/a&gt;: for teams using webpack in their build steps, enabling this configuration can provide great development-time warning for resources that exceed budgets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/siddharthkp/bundlesize&quot;&gt;bundlesize&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/pr-bot&quot;&gt;pr-bot&lt;/a&gt; let you set per-script budgets which can be automatically enforced as part of your pull-request process. Recommended!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Success in combating bloat often means &lt;em&gt;turning warnings into hard errors&lt;/em&gt;. Teams with CI or commit-queue systems should strongly consider disallowing commits that break the (performance) bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For teams starting fresh, my &lt;em&gt;strong&lt;/em&gt; recommendation is to start with a stack that embeds strong opinions about app structure, code splitting, and build targets. The best of those today are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever tools your team chooses, a budget is essential. Without one, even the most advanced, “lightweight” frameworks can easily create bloated, unusable apps. Starting from the global baseline and only increasing the budget based on hard numbers is the best way I know of to ensure your project lands well for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Endnotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interest of time and space, discussion of future-friendly architectures will have to wait for another post. The curious can dig into &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/&quot;&gt;Service Workers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/02/navigation-preload&quot;&gt;Navigation Preload&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/06/sw-readablestreams&quot;&gt;Streams&lt;/a&gt;. Their powers combined are going to fundamentally transform the optimal page-load for 2018 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, thanks to everyone who reviewed early drafts of this post, including (but not limited to): &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vinamratas&quot;&gt;Vinamrata Singal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Paul_Kinlan&quot;&gt;Paul Kinlan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/poshaughnessy&quot;&gt;Peter O’Shaughnessy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/addyosmani&quot;&gt;Addy Osmani&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/graynorton&quot;&gt;Gray Norton&lt;/a&gt;.

<description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;reason-3&quot;&gt;Reason 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm writing this post while coincidentally sitting next to the Reason team manager's manager who's trying out the new Reason syntax; his first impression is &quot;this is exactly how I think it works!&quot;. I think this alone made all our effort worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason 3 is primarily the work of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/let-def&quot;&gt;Fred&lt;/a&gt;, the maintainer of Merlin (yeah, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ocaml/merlin&quot;&gt;Merlin&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/iwankaramazow&quot;&gt;Iwan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jaredly&quot;&gt;Jared&lt;/a&gt;, over the last six months. The release packs a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of infra changes under the hood, most of which, we hope, stay invisible to you and occasionally make you feel &quot;yeah, that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; how I think it should work&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infra changes wouldn't have happened without a tight cooperation from these OCaml and JavaScript folks. We're really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; grateful for all the support we've gotten. Thank you so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reasonml-community/reason-react-example/commit/3640ce6bb6729c3b3d8a0c200a624996f8da8beb&quot;&gt;Here's how it looks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100+ parsing &amp;amp; printing issues fixed! The total open issues count went from almost 500 to &amp;lt;300.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New error messages infra, by Fred. This solves lots of existing pain points with refmt error report: reserved keywords, missing semicolon, etc. More coming soon! &lt;strong&gt;Please do give Fred a shout out on his &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/let_def&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Show that the JavaScript folks appreciate his help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unification of &lt;code&gt;[@foo]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;[@@foo]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[@@@foo]&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;[@foo]&lt;/code&gt;. Labeled argument + type punning, JS object type sugar &lt;code&gt;{. &quot;foo&quot;: string}&lt;/code&gt;, string concat is now &lt;code&gt;++&lt;/code&gt;, infix operators formatting tweaks, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've now exposed &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/reason/tree/9c578b4e5ace89e8966fc9ec747d393985b05933#installation-for-programmatic-usage&quot;&gt;dedicated APIs&lt;/a&gt; for programmatic usage of the Reason parser and printer, &lt;code&gt;refmt&lt;/code&gt;, for both native and web usage. In particular, the web version of &lt;code&gt;refmt&lt;/code&gt; powers &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.klipse.tech/reason/2017/10/06/blog-reason.html&quot;&gt;Klipse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reasonml/reason-tools&quot;&gt;reason-tools&lt;/a&gt;, the Reason docs site, etc. If you're coming from JavaScript: &lt;code&gt;npm install --save reason&lt;/code&gt; to get the single &lt;code&gt;refmt.js&lt;/code&gt; script. It gzips to &amp;lt;350kb, so go wild and impress us with your &lt;code&gt;refmt&lt;/code&gt; usages!*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aaaand yes, JS application/abstraction syntax (aka, parentheses around functions/parametrized types)&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes, you still get automatic currying; it's a pure syntactical change. Honestly, this point alone deserves its own post, but it opens the floodgates of &lt;a href=&quot;http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/Parkinsons-law-of-triviality-bikeshedding&quot;&gt;bikeshedding&lt;/a&gt;, so we're gonna refrain from writing one and will just watch you folks argue over this on Twitter (and pick the most creative rants and hang them on our wall!). More seriously, &lt;strong&gt;if you deeply care about syntax&lt;/strong&gt;, then instead of shouting about the change publicly, voice your feedbacks/complains privately to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_chenglou&quot;&gt;@_chenglou&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jordwalke&quot;&gt;@jordwalke&lt;/a&gt;. If you don't care about syntax, then great!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I get it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;2.8390957446809&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;strong&gt;migration script&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reasonml/upgradeSyntaxFrom2To3&quot;&gt;https://github.com/reasonml/upgradeSyntaxFrom2To3&lt;/a&gt;. Use it. No manual syntax upgrade needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uninstall &amp;amp; upgrade your &lt;a href=&quot;https://reasonml.github.io/guide/editor-tools/global-installation&quot;&gt;reason-cli&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;code&gt;3.0.0&lt;/code&gt; (instead of the old &lt;code&gt;1.13.7&lt;/code&gt;), for editor tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-0.73333333333333&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upgrade your project's &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript&quot;&gt;BuckleScript&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;code&gt;2.0.0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set &lt;code&gt;&quot;refmt&quot;: 3&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code&gt;bsconfig.json&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restart your editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're working on native, it's &lt;code&gt;reason.3.0.0&lt;/code&gt; on OPAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does this affect existing projects&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;3.3806818181818&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't specify &lt;code&gt;&quot;refmt&quot;: 3&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code&gt;bsconfig.json&lt;/code&gt;, nothing changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your third-party dependencies can still stay at version 2, vice-versa. Things will work as intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-0.83333333333333&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning the new syntax? &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reasonml/reason-tools&quot;&gt;Reason-tools&lt;/a&gt; now converts between syntaxes too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For native, the dependencies will have to upgrade the syntax first. We'll solve this better in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voilà!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To see the full list of the changes&lt;/strong&gt;, please go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/reason/blob/master/HISTORY.md#300&quot;&gt;HISTORY.md&lt;/a&gt;. Again, check the migration script so that you don't go and manually convert each file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you again, Fred, Iwan, Jared and all the others (hcarty, Sean, Jordan, Cristiano, Hongbo, Ricky, Andrey, etc.) for the whole effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* If you format your own blog site's Reason code using it, the post's syntax can potentially stay always up-to-date without you needing to go and manually update the snippets. And yes, we have some crazy ideas around this soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;messengercom-now-50-converted-to-reason&quot;&gt;Messenger.com Now 50% Converted to Reason&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;September 8, 2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boom!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messenger.com is the web version of Facebook Messenger; we also share code with facebook.com's inbox view and chat tabs. For over a year, the Reason team has been working directly on Messenger in order to integrate Reason + BuckleScript into the codebases. As of a while ago, we've reached 50% Reason code coverage!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;some-statistics&quot;&gt;Some Statistics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Full rebuild of the Reason part of the codebase is ~2s (a few hundreds of files), incremental build (the norm) is &lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;100ms&lt;/strong&gt; on average. The BuckleScript author estimates that the build system should scale to a few hundred thousands files in the current condition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Messenger used to receive bugs reports on a daily basis; since the introduction of Reason, there have been a total of &lt;strong&gt;10 bugs&lt;/strong&gt; (that's during the whole year, not per week)!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the messenger core team's new features are now developed in Reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dozens of massive refactors while iterating on ReasonReact. Refactoring speed went from days to hours to dozens of minutes. I don't think we've caused more than a few bugs during the process (counted toward the total number of bugs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone writing Reason got promoted for quality engineering. Just kidding. But definitely high, long-term impact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;which-teams-next&quot;&gt;Which Team's Next?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in iterating on/alongside product teams in order to create the best infra. The product teams' and open source folks' feedback has changed our strategy a few times, for the better. As of today, Reason and BuckleScript are also deployed on a WhatsApp internal tool, Instagram Web (small scale), plus some critical Ads internal tools. We'll be working closely with these teams over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've successfully onboarded regular JavaScript folks to Reason; in the most extreme case, an intern with no JS knowledge was able to ship ReasonReact code in production (and made 0 bug while doing so). Give your own team a try! =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big thanks to all these teams' members, to Hongbo (BuckleScript author) and to the OCaml community (really, 50% Reason means 50% OCaml. We're nothing without you); and of course, to all of you folks in the community for being with us all this time. The best is yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;way-way-waaaay-nicer-error-messages&quot;&gt;Way, Way, Waaaay Nicer Error Messages!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;August 25, 2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A picture's worth a thousand words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;before&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1909539/29709302-ab0c6aee-8940-11e7-953f-60a867d242cb.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
After:
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;before&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1909539/29709301-ab04eac6-8940-11e7-8d2b-c65f808b6be8.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when I'm busy working, some random colleague/Discord member would ping me and tell me &quot;Yo Cheng Lou why are Reason's errors so bad? Why can't you be more like &lt;a href=&quot;http://elm-lang.org&quot;&gt;Elm&lt;/a&gt; Cheng Lou? Why? Look at how great Elm's errors are Cheng Lou, look.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality I'm pretty darn ashamed of our error messages; here we are, a type system with two decades of solid research and implementation, but sometimes presented to the end users as if it's something that'd get in their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more! We've heard you loud and clear, and delivered you much improved error messages! A few things we did:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Display the error-ing line(s), right inside the terminal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better colors, for quicker visual search.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved messages in many cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Errors in Reason syntax for Reason files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bit of breathing room between lines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last point is a tradeoff; errors end up taking more space. Seeing that you'd usually focus on a single error rather than trying to get an overview of all errors, we've deemed this tradeoff worthwhile, especially in the context of a big amount of build output. Considering the new warning format:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;warning-after&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1909539/29711739-431be094-894b-11e7-87a6-bc1d6aeea043.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Here's the same warning, old version, buried among other outputs:
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;warning-before&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1909539/29711789-810739f8-894b-11e7-8451-a919b3f119c6.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Messenger, we've seen people ship warnings to production not because they didn't want to fix them, but because they've &lt;strong&gt;missed them&lt;/strong&gt;! It's not rocket science. Leave some negative space here and there. Color things appropriately. Voilà!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The new errors can be turned on by adding &lt;code&gt;&quot;bsc-flags&quot;: [&quot;-bs-super-errors&quot;]&lt;/code&gt; to your bsconfig.json&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reasonml-community/reason-react-example/blob/6dc15bf5fbeeb184c99acb063f7644a0d14b12f4/bsconfig.json#L3&quot;&gt;like so&lt;/a&gt;. They're also available for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bsansouci/bsb-native&quot;&gt;bsb-native&lt;/a&gt;. True to our stack's spirit, they're fast, simple to configure, and solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One more thing&lt;/strong&gt;: we're vertically integrated common pitfalls of &lt;a href=&quot;https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/&quot;&gt;ReasonReact&lt;/a&gt; into these messages too, when applicable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;reason-react&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1909539/29712284-f1013bb2-894d-11e7-9596-1cca54d5c331.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just the first of many iterations to come! Got a message you'd like to see explained better? File an issue &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reasonml-community/error-message-improvement/issues&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;much-better-playground&quot;&gt;Much Better Playground&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;August 18, 2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on popular feedback, we've now improved our online &lt;a href=&quot;https://reasonml.github.io/try&quot;&gt;Try&lt;/a&gt; section. Highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bidirectional conversion. Write Reason, get OCaml translation, vice-versa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Live evaluation, with console feedback in the lower-right section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://reasonml.github.io/api/index.html&quot;&gt;standard library&lt;/a&gt; is now loaded. Since we're evaluating on the web, This includes BuckleScript's &lt;a href=&quot;https://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/api/&quot;&gt;extra stdlib APIs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharable code snippet! Just copy the URL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some performance improvements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-website&quot;&gt;New website!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;July 14, 2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice anything different? =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new documentation website is built by our community member &lt;a href=&quot;https://jaredforsyth.com&quot;&gt;Jared&lt;/a&gt; (make sure to check his Reason blog posts too!). The new site keeps most of the same content from the old one, while providing a better structure to navigate through them. You'll notice &quot;Suggest an edit&quot; links all over the place. Take a look around!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Built with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.org&quot;&gt;Gatsby&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-reasonreact-version-released&quot;&gt;New ReasonReact version released&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;June 12, 2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very exciting release! Short version: ReasonReact now has its own documentation site &lt;a href=&quot;https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Accompanying this is the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/bs-platform&quot;&gt;BuckleScript&lt;/a&gt; release. Both are non-breaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;spring-cleaning-first-blog-post&quot;&gt;Spring Cleaning (First Blog Post!)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;May 18, 2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the community is taking off, keeping folks up-to-date through &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/reasonml&quot;&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; and other existing channels became less ideal. We're starting a blog post section for this reason. In the spirit of the community, these posts will stay short and concise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've moved unused first-party projects from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reasonml/&quot;&gt;GitHub/reasonml&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reasonml-old&quot;&gt;GitHub/reasonml-old&lt;/a&gt;. Old URLs are redirected, so no breakage here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've cleaned up the Reason codebase. Editor integrations moved out to their dedicated repos. Updated instructions are still &lt;a href=&quot;https://reasonml.github.io/guide/editor-tools/editors-plugins&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Other Reason repo cleanups are still ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some discord rooms got merged together. Fewer rooms, more focused discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see: this documentation site got a few rearrangements too. In general, if you'd like to contribute to docs, please ping us on Discord!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Leaked: EU governments want to give record labels control over what we can post</title>
<link>https://juliareda.eu/2017/10/copyright-bullies/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://juliareda.eu/2017/10/copyright-bullies/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Internet is our greatest and most egalitarian public sphere&lt;/strong&gt;: Never before was it possible for everyone to publish their creative works worldwide, at no cost, without seeking anyone’s approval. But some want to change that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-8191 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2214841137_cee38f33fc_o-1024x508.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;508&quot; srcset=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2214841137_cee38f33fc_o-1024x508.jpg 1024w, https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2214841137_cee38f33fc_o-300x149.jpg 300w, https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2214841137_cee38f33fc_o-768x381.jpg 768w, https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2214841137_cee38f33fc_o-600x297.jpg 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;cc-by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/kalleboo/2214841137/&quot;&gt;Karl Baron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open and participatory internet was made possible by laws that &lt;strong&gt;protect internet providers and online platforms from liability&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s not the duty of platforms to monitor everything users do. It’s not their fault if users commit copyright infringement – as long as they promptly react when informed of any such occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without these laws, there would be no YouTube and no SoundCloud today. For most of us, &lt;strong&gt;the internet would be more like cable TV:&lt;/strong&gt; We could consume, but we couldn’t take part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://statewatch.org/news/2017/oct/eu-copyright-fr-pt-es.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Documents leaked today by Statewatch&lt;/a&gt; expose: &lt;strong&gt;The governments of France, Spain and Portugal are pushing to redesign the web away from openness and towards the tight control &lt;/strong&gt;of cable TV, where a few big companies get to say what goes on the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cheerleading censorship machines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright wp-image-6799&quot; src=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/copyright-icon-uploadmonitoring.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;170&quot; height=&quot;170&quot; srcset=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/copyright-icon-uploadmonitoring.png 230w, https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/copyright-icon-uploadmonitoring-150x150.png 150w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px&quot;/&gt;The governments of France, Spain and Portugal want to double down on a law proposed by the European Commission that would&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/eu-copyright-reform/censorship-machines/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;force all kinds of internet platforms to install a “censorship machine”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to surveil all uploads and try to prevent copyright infringement. They want to add to the Commission proposal that platforms need to automatically remove media that has once been classified as infringing, regardless of the context in which it is uploaded (&lt;em&gt;“staydown”&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By law, every video clip of your cat that you share with an app would need to pass through filters controlled by media companies. Essentially, they would have a&lt;strong&gt; veto right to any upload to the internet. &lt;/strong&gt;These filters would be unable to safeguard your rights to quote, to make parodies, and to use existing works in any other way allowed under copyright exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube already has similar filters in place. Under pressure from rightsholders, it was one of the first platforms to turn them into a business model. Experience shows that these filters &lt;a href=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/2017/09/when-filters-fail/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;regularly remove legal content and bully less powerful creators&lt;/a&gt;. Today, many rightsholders concede that “Content ID” has only served to make YouTube more powerful, yet that has not stopped the music industry from lobbying to make these “censorship machines” mandatory everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ending the law that made the web possible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these 3 countries want to go even further: They explicitly state that they want to &lt;strong&gt;strip away the crucial liability protection from internet platforms altogether. &lt;/strong&gt;Every app, every site and every startup company that allows users to upload media and offers &lt;em&gt;“functionalities such as categorization, recommendations [or] playlists”&lt;/em&gt; could directly be sued for any copyright infringement their users commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would kill off many such platforms in Europe and &lt;a href=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/2017/04/copyright-reform-kills-eu-startups/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;discourage any new ones from developing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An attack on Freedom of speech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as these three countries were making their plans, dozens of human rights organisations and independent academics were warning in no unclear terms what these very ideas would lead to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6.5263157894737&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“[This] would place a disproportionate burden on platform providers&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;[…] [It would] lead to the systematic screening of personal data. […] &lt;strong&gt;The filtering systems would deprive users of the room for freedom of expression.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3054967&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;56 professors and scholars of copyright and internet law&lt;/a&gt; (October 20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7.1253071253071&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;The requirement to filter content in this way would violate freedom of expression.&lt;/strong&gt; […] [It] will lead to excessive filtering and deletion of content and limit the freedom to impart information on the one hand, and the freedom to receive information on the other.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.liberties.eu/en/news/delete-article-thirteen-open-letter/13194&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;An alliance of more than 50 human rights organisations, including &lt;em&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Reporters without Borders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (October 16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These 3 governments claim to be representing the interests of their people as they push for these terrible ideas. If you live in France, Spain or Portugal but do not support these plans, now is the time to &lt;strong&gt;tell your representatives and your local media!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the other member states must stand up to the three copyright bullies in the European Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big&quot; readability=&quot;5.4210526315789&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can’t let the internet become more like cable TV to enforce the interests of a few big companies. &lt;a class=&quot;tweetthis&quot; href=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/2017/10/copyright-bullies/#&quot; data-tweet=&quot;3 EU governments want to redesign the web to be more like TV, where a few big companies get to say what goes on air:&quot; onclick=&quot;javascript:return tweet(this);&quot;&gt;Tweet this!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;dek&quot; data-reactid=&quot;147&quot;&gt;Jackie Chan is in his 60s now. His stunts aren’t as insane as they once were, but he’s back on American screens with a killer new revenge flick called &lt;em&gt;The Foreigner&lt;/em&gt; (Jackie vs. evil James Bond!). So &lt;em&gt;GQ&lt;/em&gt; sent Alex Pappademas to Beijing to interview the king in his castle—a vast martial-arts complex as awesome and over-the-top as Jackie Chan himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;149&quot; readability=&quot;30.575789473684&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jackie Chan,&lt;/strong&gt; who turned 63 this year, holds the Guinness World Record for the most credits on a single movie. (Fifteen jobs, on a movie called &lt;em&gt;CZ12,&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Chinese Zodiac,&lt;/em&gt; from 2012, starring Jackie Chan, directed by Jackie Chan, gaffed by Jackie Chan, with catering coordinated by Jackie Chan.) But in his new movie, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gq.com/story/the-foreigner-trailer-jackie-chan&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Foreigner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he's mostly just an actor giving a performance, a surprisingly subtle and nuanced one, as a grief-stricken London restaurateur seeking revenge on a rogue IRA faction after their bomb kills his daughter. Not counting two &lt;em&gt;Kung Fu Panda&lt;/em&gt; sequels, &lt;em&gt;The Nut Job 2,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Lego Ninjago Movie&lt;/em&gt;—in which he voices, respectively, a monkey, a surly mouse, and a wise old piece of Lego—&lt;em&gt;The Foreigner&lt;/em&gt; will be his first high-profile U.S. release since 2010, when he played Jaden Smith's mentor in a reboot of &lt;em&gt;The Karate Kid,&lt;/em&gt; noteworthy for being a movie with &quot;karate&quot; in the title in which the only martial art practiced is kung fu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;150&quot; readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He hasn't been idle this decade. Idle is not one of the speeds in Jackie Chan's gearbox. &quot;Sometimes I look at some other actors, famous actors,&quot; he says incredulously. &quot;They're so &lt;em&gt;comfortable!&lt;/em&gt; After filming, just holiday! With a girlfriend or the family.&quot; After filming, Jackie tends to an ever-expanding portfolio of business interests, and then he makes more films. In the time since &lt;em&gt;The Foreigner&lt;/em&gt; wrapped, he's already completed a science-fiction thing called &lt;em&gt;Bleeding Steel,&lt;/em&gt; which features the first fight scene ever shot on the roof of the Sydney Opera House. But &lt;em&gt;The Foreigner&lt;/em&gt; is a different kind of Jackie Chan movie, and a lot of people are excited about it. So today Jackie's driven 30 miles from Beijing to the Panlong Valley to visit his International Stunt Training Base and talk to some foreign visitors about the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;152&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His International Stunt Training Base is one building in a giant Tony Stark–ass complex of several, all of which Jackie also owns. His personal logo—JACKIE intertwined with the Chinese character for &quot;dragon&quot;—is on its massive perforated-aluminum facade. Jackie can walk out the front door and stand at the top of the staircase leading to the limestone plaza below, look out at the green hills in the distance, and know for certain that he owns every man-made thing he can see between here and the green hills, including the chapel and the Spanish-style housing development just barely visible over the next rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;153&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, he'll show you around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;154&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an equestrian statue of Jackie Chan, made from what looks at first glance like ordinary rusty metal but turns out to be old camera equipment used on Jackie's films. Look, this klieg light, which illuminated the sets of Jackie Chan movies like &lt;em&gt;Project A&lt;/em&gt; (1983) and &lt;em&gt;Police Story&lt;/em&gt; (1985)? Now it's part of the horse body. It's a &lt;em&gt;haunch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;155&quot; readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is this legitimately fucking incredible painting, in the trompe l'oeil style, of Jackie Chan doing kung fu on a narrow rock outcropping on the edge of a dizzyingly deep canyon, and if you stand on this one precise spot on the floor and someone takes your picture, it looks, in the picture, like you too are on the actual edge of the canyon doing kung fu, or whatever you're doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;156&quot; readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a glass atrium with a hexagonal glass booth inside, and in the booth there is a 60-million-year-old tree, pulled out of the ocean off Shanghai not long ago and given to Jackie as a gift. Or maybe it's a 65,000-year-old tree. Honestly, Jackie is a little hard to pin down on the precise age of the tree. But it is almost definitely thousands and thousands of years old, this tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;157&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glass inside the prism is moist, and the tree behind the glass is moist and seems almost to be breathing, like it is the ambassador from a planet ruled by sentient driftwood, placed within a warming prism for optimum comfort during its diplomatic visit. If you visit Jackie, he will look at the tree with you. If you ask who gave it to him, he'll say he doesn't remember, that people give him &quot;so many presents.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;158&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like it should be hard to forget who gave you a thousand(s)-year-old tree, but nothing is impossible if you are Jackie Chan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;160&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Jackie will give you things if you come to see him. If he sees you admiring it, Jackie will just give you a souvenir coffee-table book containing pictures of every single member past and present of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team. The book is a kind of family history of Jackie and the crews of stunt performers who've backed him up in hundreds of films and too many action scenes to count, and also a history of cool-guy haircuts for Asian men between 1976 and the present day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;161&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just take it. Jackie wants you to have it. It weighs as much as a modest tombstone. Jackie says, &quot;You take,&quot; and you don't hear a question mark, because not taking the book is not an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;162&quot; readability=&quot;23&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My first impression of him was, we were in Inner Mongolia, and he comes riding up on one of those electric scooters, a Segway scooter, with this beautiful green Chinese military trench coat on,&quot; says Johnny Knoxville, who made a movie called &lt;em&gt;Skiptrace&lt;/em&gt; with Jackie in various regions of mainland China a year or so ago. &quot;It's a gorgeous jacket. And it's so cold that day. I'm like, 'Oh, that's a wonderful jacket.' He's like, 'You like it? It's yours.' And he just gives me the jacket right off his back. I was like, 'No, I wasn't going for that,' and he's like, 'No. No. Yours.' He gave me two or three jackets on that movie.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;163&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jackie sits in a chair in a private lounge above the main workout room of the training center. Excuse me: Jackie sits in a Louis XV–style armchair upholstered in fabric decorated with black-and-white caricatures of Jackie Chan as a skateboarding waiter in the movie &lt;em&gt;Wheels on Meals&lt;/em&gt; and as a proud dog-dad holding his golden retrievers, Jones and J.J., back when they were puppies. There are only four chairs like this in the entire world, and all of them are in this room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;165&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jackie is wearing a tracksuit with his logo on the left breast. The tracksuit is a vibrant electric blue. Jackie is talking about CGI and how he continues to train young stunt people to do things his way, even as computers make it less and less necessary for stunt performers to put themselves in real danger the way Jackie did for years, even as computers make it possible for any actor to &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; like they're doing what Jackie Chan can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;166&quot; readability=&quot;10.256756756757&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The new action star,&quot; Jackie is saying, &quot;they don't know how to fight. They can use a special effect, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gq.com/story/spider-man-homecoming-review&quot;&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone can be Spider-Man.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;167&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gestures toward a woman in the corner of the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;168&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;She can be a Superwoman. So many doubles. One of my team members [was] Wonder Woman's double. They go, &lt;em&gt;pa, pa, pa, pa, pa&lt;/em&gt;&quot;—he mimes a flurry of punches thrown by a double—&quot;then [Gal Gadot] come back, just pretty, just standing here. Ha! Easy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;170&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was really him up there, getting punched, kicked, thrown through all those windows, hit by all those cars, hanging from that helicopter over Kuala Lumpur. You have never seen another movie star suffer as much cumulative physical pain and place himself in as much danger as Jackie Chan has. The way things are going, you probably never will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;171&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jackie speaks about five languages rather well, but because he's been working in China so much lately, his English is rustier than usual. Then again, he's always made himself understood through movement. He's been telling stories with his body his entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;172&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he talks about how he came up with a move from one of his iconic fight sequences in a movie called &lt;em&gt;Snake in Eagle's Shadow,&lt;/em&gt; his arm becomes a cobra again, like it did the first time he did the move, practicing late one night in a hotel mirror in 1979, the night before he shot the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;173&quot; readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Chan says, &quot;I know I'm not young anymore. I cannot continue to make &lt;em&gt;Rush Hour 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.&lt;/em&gt; How can I continue [to] do this kind of funny face,&quot; he pretends to throw a punch and then makes a face like &lt;em&gt;Holy shit, that hurt&lt;/em&gt;, because it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; hurt to punch somebody, often as much as being punched—a truth about human frailty that Jackie made into a comic trademark, as befits the Tom Hanks of kung fu movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;175&quot; readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you've lost track&lt;/strong&gt; of Jackie since the last &lt;em&gt;Rush Hour&lt;/em&gt; or so, one thing you need to know is that, as a filmmaker and actor, he's mostly been producing product tailored specifically for the multiplex theaters now proliferating across mainland China—lavish historical action dramas, heavy with patriotic messaging about, like, the importance of repatriating Qing dynasty artifacts and the heroism of ordinary Chinese railroad workers during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Even the nominally Western-looking &lt;em&gt;Skiptrace&lt;/em&gt;—the one with Johnny Knoxville as Jackie's reluctant partner, directed by Finnish action auteur Renny Harlin &lt;em&gt;(Die Hard 2)&lt;/em&gt; from a script by two Americans—was a joint U.S.-Chinese production conceived, Chan says, to showcase China's culture and natural beauty in all their vast variety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;176&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's bigger than he's ever been, just not in America. &lt;em&gt;Skiptrace,&lt;/em&gt; which in all likelihood you have not seen, unless you're a Renny Harlin completist? It cost only $30 million to make and earned over USD 136 million last year, mostly in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;177&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another recent Jackie movie called &lt;em&gt;Kung Fu Yoga&lt;/em&gt;—the first product of an Indian-Chinese co-production agreement signed in New Delhi in 2014 by India's minister of Information and Broadcasting and China's director of State General Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, because that is the kind of United Nations shit that precedes the green-lighting of a Jackie Chan movie now—opened and closed in the United States within four weeks and made $362,657. In China, it made $254 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;178&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 2017, according to &lt;em&gt;Forbes,&lt;/em&gt; Jackie was the world's 39th-highest-paid entertainer, which puts him behind Beyoncé, LeBron James, and The Rock but ahead of Kim Kardashian, Tom Cruise, and Taylor Swift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;179&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He now has a sprawling portfolio of business interests outside the movie industry, particularly mainland-China brand-ambassador partnerships brokered through the Hong Kong–based luxury-goods importer Sparkle Roll Holdings. Around 2010, he moved his operations from Hong Kong to Beijing. Also, after years of not having been a publicly political guy in any way, the newly wealthy Jackie has become vocally and sometimes vociferously pro-China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;180&quot; readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People say Jackie became a patriot when he got rich, or got rich because he was so willing to become a patriot. Either way, it's cost him some fans back in Hong Kong, the city of his birth. So have remarks like the ones he made in 2012, when he referred to Hong Kong as a chaotic &quot;city of protest marches&quot; and suggested that more stringent public-demonstration laws might help make the city great again. It wasn't the first time he'd said stuff like this, nor the last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;181&quot; readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one level, &lt;em&gt;The Foreigner,&lt;/em&gt; which also stars Pierce Brosnan as a sexy, compromised Gerry Adams analogue, is a pure product of a new vertically integrated moment in Jackie's career. It was financed by Jackie and his friends at the media division of Sparkle Roll, the Chinese conglomerate Huyai Brothers Media, and STX Entertainment, the private-equity-incubated Hollywood media start-up that brought you &lt;em&gt;Bad Moms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;182&quot; readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's also the first must-see Jackie movie in years, a gray-lion action movie in the &lt;em&gt;Taken&lt;/em&gt; mold, a film that builds on the fact that Jackie is not as young as he used to be, instead of pretending it's not obvious. Director Martin Campbell—best known for bridging the Brosnan and Daniel Craig eras of the James Bond franchise—keeps the action sequences fast, lean, and brutal. But like the original &lt;em&gt;Taken,&lt;/em&gt; in which Liam Neeson's aura of lived-in sorrow elevated a fantasy about cathartic revenge and masculine über-competence, this is a movie with an actual performance at its center, one that may surprise even the biggest Chan stans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;183&quot; readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning in the late '70s, Jackie made a string of hugely successful Chinese-language action comedies in which he borrowed shamelessly from Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, and Buster Keaton, injecting the solemn martial-arts-movie formula with visual wit and suicidal daring. In the best films he made between 1978's &lt;em&gt;Drunken Master&lt;/em&gt; (under the influence, lazy goof becomes virtuoso fighter) and 1985's &lt;em&gt;Police Story&lt;/em&gt; (modern-day Jackie as a modern-day cop, part one of a franchise), what you're watching is one of the most brilliant physical comedians in the history of movies entering world cinema through the side door of genre (or, this being Jackie, the second-floor window).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;184&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he hasn't done a lot of capital-&lt;em&gt;A acting.&lt;/em&gt; He tends to play the same guy over and over, a regular dude caught up in insane circumstances, as surprised to find himself doing crazy daredevil shit as you or I would be. Like a lot of true movie stars, he's always seemed nervous about turning off the charm. Even when he staggers into an alley to puke up scotch as a tormented cop in 2004's uncharacteristically gritty &lt;em&gt;New Police Story,&lt;/em&gt; there's something Chaplin-esque about the wobble in his legs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Foreigner&lt;/em&gt; does build to a pretty incredible close-quarters fist-and-gun fight in which Jackie, as the broken-man protagonist Mr. Quan, is seen kicking ass and weaponizing household objects like Fred Astaire dancing with a hat rack. But the movie takes quite a while to get there, and in that time a surprisingly dialed-down and vulnerable Jackie delivers a keenly affecting performance as a parent who has lost a child and knows he can't get her back no matter how many IRA goons he takes out with MacGyver-esque IEDs and punji sticks and his own bloody knuckles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;186&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campbell says he was a Jackie fan from way back, but he had never considered Jackie for &lt;em&gt;The Foreigner,&lt;/em&gt; until he watched &lt;em&gt;The Karate Kid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;187&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There's a marvelous scene where [Jackie's character] destroys this car,&quot; Campbell says. &quot;I think it was a car crash that killed his family, and he survived, and every year he reconstructs and remodels this car to perfect condition, and on the day of their death he smashes it with a sledgehammer, as a kind of wailing wall, as it were. He's excellent in that film. That really was the clue for me that he could do this.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;188&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If I'm [to] continue on in the film industry,&quot; Jackie says, &quot;I have to change. Otherwise, you gone. You see—in Japan. Korea. America. China. Hong Kong. How many action star all gone? Only few can stay. Stallone's different. He's a legend. Other action stars already gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;189&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;So that's why I'm looking for different script, different character, different Jackie Chan. I want the audience look at Jackie Chan as an actor. Not the action star. Actor who can fight. Look at Clint Eastwood. If he continue to 'Make my day'? Gone. So he change to directing. He change some other things. Look at Al Pacino. Robert De Niro. I wanna be an Asian Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;190&quot; readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I want the movie not just finished, released, gone,&quot; Jackie says. &quot;I want the movie 20 years later—right now, you still see &lt;em&gt;Titanic.&lt;/em&gt; Wow! So good! Twenty years later, &lt;em&gt;Avatar,&lt;/em&gt; still good. I don't want to make a movie, boom, finish, release one month, gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;191&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;The Sound of Music,&quot;&lt;/em&gt; Jackie Chan says. &quot;So good!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;193&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jackie's first real American&lt;/strong&gt; hit was &lt;em&gt;Rumble in the Bronx,&lt;/em&gt; in 1995. It featured Jackie speaking English, a predominantly Western cast, and an extraordinary hovercraft chase. It was filmed in Vancouver, and there are a few shots in which the snowcapped mountains of the Bronx are clearly visible in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;194&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Line Cinema picked up the American rights to &lt;em&gt;Rumble&lt;/em&gt; for $5 million and gave it the tagline &quot;No fear, no stuntman, no equal&quot;; it made $32 million and became the first Hong Kong movie ever to top the U.S. box-office charts. New Line picked up a few more of his Chinese movies and re-released them, as did Miramax. They did okay, for Americanized versions of films his cultists had already seen. One of those cultists thought he could improve on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;196&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brett Ratner was a 27-year-old music-video director with exactly one feature film to his credit, but he was also a Jackie Chan fanatic. He wanted to put Jackie in an edgy urban buddy-cop movie, one that would place him on equal footing with an American star instead of making him a sidekick, one where Jackie would wear a black suit and look cool. He found out Jackie was filming a movie in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;197&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I got on a plane,&quot; says Ratner, calling from a treadmill, &quot;and flew 22 hours to have lunch with him. We get to the restaurant. It's a Chinese restaurant in South Africa. So weird. And he feeds me abalone. It was like a piece of rubber. And I'm chewing it and spitting it in my napkin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;198&quot; readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Then he gives me a glass of wine,&quot; says Ratner, who doesn't drink or smoke, &quot;and I have to pretend like I'm drinking it. Then he's like, &lt;em&gt;Let's smoke a cigar,&lt;/em&gt; and I'm like, &lt;em&gt;Is this guy&lt;/em&gt; testing &lt;em&gt;me? What the hell?&lt;/em&gt; All the things I don't do.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;199&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ratner pitched Jackie, and Jackie listened, and didn't say yes or no, and then he drove Ratner back to the airport. A few days later Ratner got word that Jackie was in. Not long after that Jackie flew to Los Angeles so that Ratner could introduce him to his future co-star, Chris Tucker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;200&quot; readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They had a conversation for 30 minutes,&quot; Ratner says. &quot;&lt;em&gt;I love you Jackie Chan! You the man!&lt;/em&gt; And [Jackie] was all, &lt;em&gt;Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you again.&lt;/em&gt; Halfway through, Chris says, &lt;em&gt;Brett, can we talk outside for a minute?&lt;/em&gt; and I go, &lt;em&gt;Yeah.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;201&quot; readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;And we go outside, and Chris says, &lt;em&gt;Brett, Jackie Chan don't speak English! How we gon' do a movie when he don't speak English?&lt;/em&gt; I said, &lt;em&gt;Oh, it'll be fine.&lt;/em&gt; Anyway. We go back in. Chris leaves. I said, &lt;em&gt;Jackie, how did you like Chris?&lt;/em&gt; And Jackie says, &lt;em&gt;I like Chris, but I don't understand how he talks.&lt;/em&gt; I said to myself, &lt;em&gt;This is going to be fucking genius.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;202&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rush Hour&lt;/em&gt; grossed more than $140 million—it was the seventh-biggest movie of 1998, outperforming the likes of &lt;em&gt;Godzilla&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Deep Impact&lt;/em&gt;—and spawned a franchise that has so far generated more than $800 million. But it didn't really lead Jackie to great roles in good movies. In the years that followed, Hollywood basically treated him like a kids'-menu item in dreck like &lt;em&gt;Around the World in 80 Days&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Spy Next Door&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Tuxedo. Rush Hour&lt;/em&gt; bought him a $3 million house in Beverly Hills—right down the street from Harold Lloyd's old place—and he was presented with an honorary Oscar in 2016, but he's never really been challenged and protected by an American director in quite the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;203&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Jackie has, in my opinion, gotten exploited, in a way,&quot; Ratner says. &quot;He started doing these movies where they were making him look like a fucking buffoon. And he went for it and he made some bad choices.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;204&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, Ratner adds: &quot;I just saw the new movie&quot;—&lt;em&gt;The Foreigner&lt;/em&gt;—&quot;and I thought he was brilliant in it. I always said he's a real actor. But he never got his opportunity, and I think with this new film, there's some people who are going to be surprised.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;206&quot; readability=&quot;13.40243902439&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pierce Brosnan&lt;/strong&gt; calls from Hawaii, having just finished spearfishing, which is the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gq.com/story/pierce-brosnan-suit-guide&quot;&gt;Pierce Brosnan&lt;/a&gt;–ish way to begin a phone call. Brosnan says Jackie acquitted himself brilliantly on the set every day, but that they never really got to know each other, because at the end of the day Jackie would hop on his jet and go home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;207&quot; readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I remember there were waste-disposal garbage cans on the set that were collapsible, and he just fell in love with them. He'd buy 50 of them,&quot; Brosnan says. &quot;Really. Or on the craft service, there were these tables, and he liked the way the tables were made, so he'd buy, y'know, 12 of those, and ship them all back to China. Quite extraordinary.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;208&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the best anecdote Pierce Brosnan has to share, and they made an entire movie together. There were dinners scheduled, Brosnan says, but they fell through, which means that Pierce Brosnan never actually had dinner with Jackie Chan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;209&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I did, and what I can tell you is that if Jackie Chan invites you to his restaurant, you should go. He owns a fine-dining traditional-Chinese restaurant located near the city center of Beijing, in what was once a three-story Burberry store. Everyone who comes from out of town to visit him at the International Stunt Training Base is invited to dinner with him and his stunt team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;210&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Jackie Chan invites you to dinner and it takes longer for the rest of the dinner guests to arrive, you might get to sit with him beforehand in a private antechamber, and he might pull out his laptop and show you some things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;211&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some concept illustrations for some new products he wants to introduce—some kind of new take on the plastic bottle that he says Will Smith is interested in partnering with him on, modular coffee stands made of reclaimed wood and metal, so many patent applications and business ideas you will start to wish you'd brought along a prospectus for him to review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;212&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some videos. First a YouTube-style supercut of his gnarliest injuries. Then a kind of infomercial for Jackie Chan, chronicling his philanthropic efforts around the world, which begins as a somewhat uncomfortable thing to sit through in the presence of its subject and eventually floods and disables whatever part of your brain controls the cynicism response, because holy shit this guy does a lot of nice things for people, especially children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;213&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's Jackie detonating land mines in Cambodia (sadly, not with his bare hands). Here's Jackie hanging out with tsunami survivors and New York City schoolkids who witnessed 9/11. Here's Jackie getting off the plane he chartered so he could fly to China's Qinghai province and comfort survivors of the 2010 Yushu earthquake. Here's Jackie donating coats to the elderly. It all starts to blur together—so many oversize checks, so many shots of Jackie high-fiving fans, the testimonials from Arnold Schwarzenegger and Zhang Yimou and Jeffrey Katzenberg and Owen Wilson and Sly Stallone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;214&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jackie also sings the theme song for this video, and at some point during the screening he pulls a Bluetooth speaker out of his bag and pairs it with his laptop, so we can hear his voice more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;215&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is Jackie, giving his time and money from Holland to Rwanda to East Timor. Here, for some reason, is Lionel Richie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;216&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a good chance that if you get to talk to Jackie in a context like this, he will talk shit about Hong Kong without even really being prompted to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;217&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point in this conversation, Jackie tells a long and difficult-to-summarize story about how and why he came to own eight almost 400-year-old sandalwood houses from China's Anhui province. It begins many years ago, with Jackie deciding to buy a nearly 400-year-old sandalwood house, which he planned to disassemble and rebuild in Hong Kong for his aging father (who died in 2008) to live in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;219&quot; readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once he and his father realize that these houses, lacking air-conditioning and indoor plumbing, aren't exactly what a modern person would consider livable, Jackie decides he wants to donate what is now his collection of almost 400-year-old sandalwood houses—because of course in the meantime he's acquired seven &lt;em&gt;additional&lt;/em&gt; nearly 400-year-old sandalwood houses, plus a pavilion and an opera stage—to the city of Hong Kong, as a historical attraction. But the fire department gives him a hard time and the politicians give him a hard time, and the story ends with Jackie donating his houses to a university in Singapore instead. The moral seems to be that Jackie had to leave Hong Kong, because Hong Kong drove him away by being a city run by jerks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;220&quot; readability=&quot;24&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In Hong Kong,&quot; Jackie says, &quot;everybody know Jackie Chan. Everybody friend. But they know money, more than friend. In China, money nothing. Friend, &lt;em&gt;important.&lt;/em&gt; They so rich in China, they say, &lt;em&gt;Jackie Chan, you move in, free. I just use your name—Jackie Chan movie theater, Jackie Chan restaurant. I pay you.&lt;/em&gt; In Hong Kong, I know a lot of rich people—&lt;em&gt;Yeah, Jackie, come on, open some restaurant&lt;/em&gt;—but the rental very expensive.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;221&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can ask if it makes him feel sad, this situation, the perception in his old hometown that their hero has turned heel, and he will answer a different question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;222&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;A lot of people ask, 'Somebody screw you on the Internet. Are you angry?' I say no. Me? So happy. If 7 billion people didn't like me, that's a problem. I must change. If only 1 million people don't like you? It's okay.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;223&quot; readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His stuntmen have arrived and arrayed themselves around a big round table. Dinner is served. Jackie does not stop moving. He ladles food onto his guests' plates, pours wine, pops up to fetch carafes of Moutai, a lethally potent clear liquor distilled from fermented sorghum. It's Jackie's own signature Moutai, produced as a tie-in product with &lt;em&gt;Dragon Blade,&lt;/em&gt; a 2015 Jackie movie about Romans on the Silk Road that for reasons unexplained by Chinese or Roman history co-starred John Cusack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;224&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will give you a bottle of it. You don't even have to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;225&quot; readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are invited to dinner at Jackie Chan's restaurant, you will be warned that he doesn't like to be interviewed while he eats, and that at some point he will rap his fists on the table, which indicates that the meal is over, and no one will linger long after that. At some point when you have all had a Moutai or two, perhaps he will get a little mellow, a little free-associative, and the table talk will go quiet so that people can listen to him speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;226&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will talk about the ten years of Dickensian privation he endured as a ward of the China Drama Academy, where he learned the skills required to perform Peking opera—acting, singing, tumbling, stage combat, the roots of what he does in movies to this day—and also how to take a caning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;227&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You get up five o'clock in the morning. Training until five o'clock. We would never take off the shoes. You don't have &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; to take off the shoes. Tough training. Very tough. Hours—a thousand punch, 500 kick. &lt;em&gt;Pa, pa, pa, pa, pa.&lt;/em&gt; Turn-around kick, hundred. Left side, hundred.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;228&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was one of hundreds. All these boys and girls at the drama school. A few of them went on to be movie actors like he did. But only Jackie has a hundred films. Only Jackie has private jets with his name on the tail. A restaurant. All this. If you bring this up to Jackie at the right moment, he will allow himself to marvel at it, for a minute or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;229&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sometimes I look back myself. It really is a miracle,&quot; Jackie says. &quot;So many people work very hard. Why I just come out? Lucky, yes. It's not just lucky. I work very hard, when I was young. Everybody sleeping, I still watch the mirror, to do a drunken style.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;230&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he pounds the table in rhythm and his stuntmen join him in pounding the table, and with that the meal is concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed p&quot; data-reactid=&quot;231&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Pappademas&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;also has the body of a vital 63-year-old man.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Radix sort is a neat sorting algorithm, but it requires you to know a bit more about your data. At each step, you bin the data based on the current digit you're looking at. For example, if we want to sort: 21, 10, 02, 12, 22, 11 We could do this from the most-significant digit (MSD) by first creating bins for 0_, 1_, 2_ as: [02] [10, 12, 11] [21, 22] And then creating sub-bins within these, for _0, _1, _2: [[],[],[02]], [[10],[11],[12]], [,[],[21],[22]]. Concatenated together, this creates the sorted list 02,10,11,12,21,22 You can also do this starting from the least significant digit (LSD), first for the digits _0, _1, _2: [10], [11,21], [02, 12, 22] And then merging those into bins based on the leading digit 0_, 1_, 2_: [02], [10, 11, 12], [21, 22] Concatenated together, this creates the same sorted list: 02, 10, 11, 12, 21, 22.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Waymo Will Test Self-Driving Cars in Snowy Detroit</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;The self-driving cars Google designed are going to the snow -- and the seat of the car industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GOOGL:US&quot; title=&quot;Financial Analysis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alphabet Inc.&lt;/a&gt;’s Waymo, the vehicle arm of Google’s parent, announced on Thursday that it will start testing its autonomous Chrysler minivans on roads in the greater Detroit area. Michigan will be the sixth state where Waymo has run its vehicles on public roads. But the region is the first with a winter dominated by snow and ice, the kind of inclement conditions that pose hurdles for vehicle sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Having lived through fourteen Michigan winters, I’m confident that there are few better places that will prepare our self-driving cars for winter conditions,” John Krafcik, Waymo’s chief executive officer and a former Ford Motor Co. executive, said in a statement. Waymo opened a testing facility in suburban Detroit last year.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The hometown automakers are already there. Ford has tested self-driving cars in the state (including some for &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-29/ford-domino-s-to-test-consumer-appetite-for-driverless-delivery&quot; title=&quot;Ford, Domino’s Test Appetite for Driverless Pizza Delivery (2)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pizza delivery&lt;/a&gt;). General Motors Co.’s Cruise Automation is experimenting there as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waymo has compiled 3.5 million miles of public road testing since 2009. It’s widely seen as the front-runner in driverless car technology, which could upend the auto market if and when it arrives. Yet Waymo has sworn off manufacturing its own vehicles, and hasn’t disclosed how it plans to spread its package of self-driving sensors and software to a commercial fleet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in April, Waymo began testing a free service with select passengers in Phoenix, using some of its 600 minivans from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. A Waymo spokesman declined to specify how many vehicles would be used in Detroit.&lt;/p&gt;

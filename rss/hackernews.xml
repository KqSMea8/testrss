<title>Firefox 59 released</title>
<link>https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/59.0/releasenotes/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/59.0/releasenotes/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;Version 59.0, first offered to Release channel users on March 13, 2018&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a regular reader of Firefox release notes (and thank you if you are!) you’re probably aware of just how much we’ve invested in the performance of Firefox Quantum. We launched an entirely new engine in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/57.0/releasenotes/&quot;&gt;November&lt;/a&gt;, made significant improvements to graphics rendering in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/58.0/releasenotes/&quot;&gt;January&lt;/a&gt;, and are continuing to post performance gains and add features with this release. On Firefox for desktop, we’ve improved page load times, added tools to annotate and crop your Firefox Screenshots, and made it easier to arrange your Top Sites on the Firefox Home page. On Firefox for Android, we’ve added support for sites that stream video using the HLS protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, this is made possible by Mozillians around the world, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/community/2018/02/27/firefox-59-new-contributors/&quot;&gt;new Mozillians&lt;/a&gt; who contributed to this release of Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Developer Survey Results</title>
<link>https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Each month, about 50 million people visit Stack Overflow to learn, share, and build their careers. We estimate that 21 million of these people are professional developers and university-level students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our estimate of professional developers comes from the things people &lt;a href=&quot;https://kevinmontrose.com/2015/01/27/providence-machine-learning-at-stack-exchange/&quot;&gt;read and do&lt;/a&gt; when they visit Stack Overflow. We collect data on user activity to help surface jobs we think you might find interesting and questions we think you can answer. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/users/prediction-data&quot;&gt;download&lt;/a&gt; and clear this data at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;sub class=&quot;_muted _line-top&quot;&gt;92,098 responses; select all that apply&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost 60% of respondents identify as back-end developers, and about 20% consider themselves mobile developers. The median number of developer type identifications per respondent is 2, and the most common pairs are combinations of back-end, front-end, and full-stack developer. Pairs that are highly correlated are database administrator and system administrator, DevOps specialist and system administrator, and designer and front-end developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost half of professional developers contribute to open source projects. Involvement in open source varies with language. Over 70% of developers who work with Rust, Julia, and Clojure contribute to open source, while less than 40% of developers who work with VBA, VB.NET, and C# do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many developers work on code outside of work. Over 80% of our respondents say that they code as a hobby. Other interests or responsibilities outside of software don't seem to reduce developers' interest in coding as a hobby. Those who said they are parents or have other caretaking responsibilities, those who exercise daily, or those who spend the most time outside were slightly &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; likely to code as a hobby than other groups.&lt;/p&gt;

DevOps as a discipline and professional identity is relatively new, but the people working in this field are highly experienced. Game/graphics developers and mobile developers have the fewest years of experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We asked our respondents about their gender identity, and found that over 90% of our respondents are male. According to Quantcast, women account for about 10% of Stack Overflow’s US traffic; this year 9% of US survey respondents are women. We had survey participation at almost the rate we would expect from our traffic. In regions including the United States, India, and the UK, women are represented at higher levels among students than among professional developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We find differences among developers by gender in our survey responses. For example, twice as many women than men have been coding two years or less. Also, developers who identify as transgender and non-binary contribute to open source at higher rates (58% and 60%, respectively) than developers who identify as men or women overall (45% and 33%.)&lt;/p&gt;

All categories have dramatically more developers who identify as men than women but the ratio of men to women varies. Developers who are educators or academic researchers are about 10 times more likely to be men than women, while developers who are system admins or DevOps specialists are 25-30 times more likely to be men than women. Women have the highest representation as academics, QA developers, data scientists, and designers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;sub class=&quot;_muted _line-top&quot;&gt;68,577 responses; agreement on a 1-5 scale, from strongly disagree to strongly agree&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;p&gt;We asked how much respondents agree or disagree with several statements about their place in the developer community. Overall 70% of developers agree or strongly agree that they feel a sense of connection with other developers. Developers are overall confident about their own skills compared to their peers, with only 18% agreeing or strongly agreeing that they are not as good at programming as their colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

More experienced developers feel more connected, more confident, and less competitive. Notice that feeling less skilled drops quickly with experience while feeling less competitive drops more gradually and continues to drop into the second decade of coding experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;sub class=&quot;_muted _line-top&quot;&gt;62,596 responses&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year we asked respondents if they have children or other dependents that they care for, and about a quarter of respondents say that they do. We asked in a free response question what these developers do for dependent care during work hours, and our respondents talked about options like school, their spouses/partners, and daycare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developers who said they do not have dependents to care for are younger on average than those who do. Over 30% of the developers without dependents are younger than 25, while only 5% of those with dependents are younger than 25. Almost 60% of developers with 10 or more years of professional coding experience have children or other dependents.&lt;/p&gt;

The hope is that it will lead to a commercial network of flying taxis in New Zealand in as soon as three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;177&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1925&quot;&gt;The move is a big step forward in the commercialization of this technology, which even the most optimistic prognosticators had recently bet would take another decade to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;259&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2184&quot;&gt;The decision to embrace the commercial use of flying taxis offers New Zealand an opportunity to leapfrog many developed countries in this area, and perhaps give it a head start over Silicon Valley, where much of the most innovative work has been taking place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;428&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2612&quot;&gt;In an email, Ms. Ardern said the decision to work with Kitty Hawk was “about sending the message to the world that our doors are open for people with great ideas who want to turn them into reality.” She added, “We’ve got an ambitious target in New Zealand of being net carbon zero by 2050,” and given that the Kitty Hawk vehicle is fully electric, “exciting projects like this are part of how we make that happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;488&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3100&quot;&gt;Back here in the United States, the move stands as a major challenge for our regulators, in particular the Federal Aviation Administration. While the F.A.A. allows test flights of autonomous vehicles, there is no path to certify and commercialize them despite a constant stream of headlines about efforts from Uber, Airbus and others. Thus far, the agency, which oversees much busier skies than New Zealand and has long been underfunded, has been slow to adopt rules for new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;309&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3409&quot;&gt;Other countries, mostly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/world/middleeast/dubai-passenger-drones.html&quot;&gt;in the Middle East&lt;/a&gt; and Africa, have been more aggressive about allowing unmanned flights and appear willing to be some of the first places where this technology will be used. But those countries have never been seen as models for aviation regulators in the rest of the developed world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;223&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3632&quot;&gt;New Zealand, on the other hand, has long been viewed as having a thoughtful and safety-conscious regulatory regime. That means that the rules it develops may become a template for other nations, including the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

Airbus made an investment two weeks ago in Blade, an aviation start-up in New York. Dubai formed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zdnet.com/article/dubai-begins-testing-drone-taxi-service/&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zdnet.com/article/dubai-begins-testing-drone-taxi-service/&quot;&gt;partnership with a Chinese company, EHang&lt;/a&gt;. And of course Uber has an entire division called Uber Elevate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;412&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4376&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;For those who follow the progress in this field — technologists, flight enthusiasts and billionaires seeking to transform the skies — it was thought that Mr. Page had been testing flights of a new self-piloting plane only in Northern California; several reports and images revealed the existence of newfangled aircraft last year from a company based there, called Zee Aero, that was associated with Mr. Page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;406&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4782&quot;&gt;The mystery of what has been going on in New Zealand has quietly created a stir among those in the know. Kitty Hawk set up Zephyr in 2016 and has been in discussions, under a nondisclosure agreement, with regulators there for the past 18 months. There has been some speculation about the origin of Zephyr because it lists its chief executive as Fred Reid, who had also been listed as president of Zee Aero.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;382&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5164&quot;&gt;Mr. Page’s ambitions to create taxis in the sky has a sense of gravity, excuse the pun, not just because of his deep pockets and the technological prowess of his team but also because of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/fred-reid-6437095/&quot;&gt;Mr. Reid&lt;/a&gt;, who is a former chief executive of Virgin America. Before that he was president of Delta Air Lines and president of Lufthansa Airlines, where he was co-architect of the Star Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;278&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5442&quot;&gt;In an interview, Mr. Reid said the opportunity to use New Zealand as the first place to commercialize the autonomous taxi service was a step-change in the advancement of the sector. Kitty Hawk is already working on an app that would allow customers to hail one of its air taxis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;358&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5800&quot;&gt;The aircraft, known as Cora, has a wingspan of 36 feet with a dozen rotors all powered by batteries. It can fly about 62 miles and carry two passengers. (Its code name had been Zee.Aero — hence all the speculation and confusion.) The plan, at least for now, isn’t for Kitty Hawk to sell the vehicles; it wants to own and operate a network of them itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;311&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6111&quot;&gt;But before everyone gets too excited — or nervous — about this “Jetsons”-like future, just know that virtually every prediction about how quickly air taxis would arrive has been wrong. Just last year, Dubai said EHang would begin operating an autonomous flying taxi service last July. It never happened.&lt;/p&gt;

It is 36 feet, not 12 feet.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Trump Issues Order to Block Broadcom’s Takeover of Qualcomm</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-12/trump-issues-order-to-block-broadcom-s-takeover-of-qualcomm</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-12/trump-issues-order-to-block-broadcom-s-takeover-of-qualcomm</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump issued an executive order Monday blocking &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AVGO:LN&quot; title=&quot;company profile&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Broadcom Ltd.&lt;/a&gt; from pursuing its hostile takeover of &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/QCOM:US&quot; title=&quot;company profile&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Qualcomm Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, scuttling a $117 billion deal that had been scrutinized by a secretive panel over the tie-up’s threat to U.S. national security.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Trump acted on a recommendation by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which reviews acquisitions of American firms by foreign investors. The decision was unveiled just hours after Hock Tan, the chief executive officer of Singapore-based Broadcom, met with officials at the Pentagon in a last-ditch effort to salvage what would have been the biggest technology deal in history.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&quot;There is credible evidence that leads me to believe that Broadcom Ltd.,&quot; by acquiring Qualcomm, &quot;might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States,&quot; Trump said in the &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/P5I18K0DF7OK&quot; title=&quot;link to White House order&quot; class=&quot;terminal-news-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; released Monday evening in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The order underscores the tough stance the Trump administration is taking on foreign takeovers of U.S. technology firms. In September, he &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-09-13/trump-blocks-china-backed-bid-for-chipmaker-over-security-risk&quot; title=&quot;Beijing Asks Fairness in Other Deals After Trump Blocks Chip Bid&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blocked&lt;/a&gt; the sale of Lattice Semiconductor Corp. to a Chinese-backed investor. That was just the fourth time in a quarter century that a U.S. president stopped a foreign takeover of an American firm on national security grounds. At least a half-dozen technology deals have collapsed during the Trump administration in the face of concerns raised by CFIUS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Broadcom said in a statement it was reviewing the order and that it &quot;strongly disagrees that its proposed acquisition of Qualcomm raises any national security concerns.&quot; Qualcomm didn’t respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares in Qualcomm fell 4.83 percent at 9:20 a.m. in Frankfurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i7ofG7MVG_MU/v1/-1x-1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order marked an unprecedented move by the White House to stop a hostile bid for a company. Broadcom didn’t have an agreement to buy San Diego-based Qualcomm. It was fighting to win support from Qualcomm shareholders to gain control of its rival’s board and move forward with its offer. Before waiting for an actual deal, CFIUS opened an investigation to review the risks to national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, CFIUS was split on whether to weigh in. Pentagon officials insisted on a review of Broadcom’s proxy battle, while Treasury had pushed back, according to people familiar with the &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-01/broadcom-bid-for-qualcomm-is-said-to-raise-u-s-security-concern&quot; title=&quot;Broadcom Bid for Qualcomm Is Said to Raise U.S. Security Concern&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;matter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then on March 4, Treasury ordered Qualcomm to postpone its shareholder vote by 30 days, saying that a takeover by Broadcom threatened Qualcomm’s leadership in developing the next generation of wireless technology. The government said it feared Broadcom would cut investment in research and development in order to increase short-term profits. That could allow Chinese companies, namely Huawei Technologies Co., to become the dominant supplier, the U.S. said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump’s order came as Broadcom was in the midst of moving its headquarters from Singapore to the U.S. Broadcom had announced the move in November after Tan met with Trump at the White House. After the meeting, CFIUS approved Broadcom’s takeover of Brocade Communications Systems, conditioned on the headquarters move, according to Broadcom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-tout-type=&quot;story&quot;&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-13/how-china-s-huawei-killed-117-billion-broadcom-deal-quicktake&quot; title=&quot;Click for full story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;How China’s Huawei Killed $117 Billion Broadcom Deal: QuickTake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Tan went to the Pentagon to meet with CFIUS officials in a bid to address their concerns. Tan argued that combining Broadcom and Qualcomm would actually further U.S. interests by advancing the development of the next generation of wireless technology known as 5G, according to a person familiar with the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tan’s meeting followed a letter from Treasury to the companies Sunday that said national security risks from the takeover may prompt a recommendation to Trump to block the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In the absence of information that changes CFIUS’s assessment of the national security risks posed by this transaction, CFIUS would consider taking further action, including but not limited to referring the transaction to the president for decision,&quot; Treasury said in the letter, which Qualcomm made public earlier Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;— With assistance by Ian King&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>New ThinkPad Guts Bring Intel Core I, DDR4, USB 3 to Cult Laptops</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;We often see people funneling their passion into keeping beloved devices in operation long past their manufacturer’s intent. These &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.51nb.com/forum.php?mod=viewthread&amp;amp;tid=1811153&amp;amp;extra=page=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;replacement Thinkpad motherboards&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;amp;tl=en&amp;amp;js=y&amp;amp;prev=_t&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fforum.51nb.com%2Fforum.php%3Fmod%3Dviewthread%26tid%3D1811153%26extra%3Dpage%3D1&amp;amp;edit-text=&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;translated&lt;/a&gt;) bring old (yet beloved) Thinkpads a much desired processor upgrade. This is the work of the user [HOPE] on the enthusiast forum 51nb. The hack exemplifies what happens when that passion for legendary gear hits deep electrical expertise and available manufacturing. This isn’t your regular laptop refurbishment, [HOPE] is building something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThinkPads are known for their zealous following (&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackaday.com/2016/10/28/apple-sucks-now-heres-a-thinkpad-buyers-guide/&quot;&gt;as our own [Brian Benchoff] underscored last year&lt;/a&gt;). Lenovo has steered the venerable brand into the future while the laptop market has drifted deeper and deeper into the wilds of tight integration at the expense of user modification. Along the way 4:3 screens were traded for media-friendly 16:9, TrackPoints were traded for trackpads, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_ThinkPad_ThinkLight&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;classic ThinkLight&lt;/a&gt; gave way to real keyboard backlights. These progressions left a shrinking but vocal group of old school Thinkpad enthusiasts — the cult of Thinkpad — clinging to beloved devices like 2007’s X61 and T60 ignored by a changing market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an astounding turn of ingenuity [HOPE] has revitalized these classic ThinkPads by entirely replacing their motherboards. And not just for one particular model, there are options available for at least 3 families of computers. The new devices are referred to by model numbers never used by IBM or Lenovo; &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.51nb.com/forum.php?mod=viewthread&amp;amp;tid=1650395&amp;amp;extra=page=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the X60/61 motherboard makes an X62&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.51nb.com/forum.php?mod=viewthread&amp;amp;tid=1810987&amp;amp;extra=page=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the X200/201 motherboard makes an X210&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.51nb.com/forum.php?mod=viewthread&amp;amp;tid=1718306&amp;amp;extra=page=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;T60 motherboard makes a T70&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on the customer’s preference either a bare motherboard or a fully assembled unit is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the exact model in question these motherboards slot directly into the original chassis but add recent generation Intel Core I processors, DDR4, USB 3.0/3.1, Thunderbolt 3 and more. Often they reuse the original heat sinks and fans, and expose these ports through the same chassis apertures the original motherboards used. Considering these machines are a decade older than the hardware being crammed inside them the level of integration is truly impressive. The end result looks like it could have come out of a Lenovo factory just before Spring Festival. If you look closely at the image at the top of this article, you might notice they even included an improved “Intel Inside” sticker on the palm rest and a model number label at the lower left of the display!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an implicit economic statement here that’s worth calling out. A motherboard for anything more significant than a basic microcontroller is an incredibly complicated piece of technology. When the bar is moved from “small ARM processor” up to “modern x86 system” this counts extra. Not only are they complex electrically but the fabrication processes required to physically create them are at the edge of what you’d find at your favorite cheap PCB fab house. We’re talking CPUs studded with about 1100 pins, DDR4 and PCI-E with extremely tight electrical timing requirements driving elaborate board layouts, and a plethora of off-board peripheral parts. On top of those constraints the board itself must be small enough to fit inside, not a purpose-built enclosure, but an existing laptop body with whatever combination of mounting brackets and connector placements Lenovo decided on. That a hobbyist (we assume) can make their own devices in this range to sell for $500-$700 is nothing short of astounding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shouldn’t be possible. More accurately, it’s likely possible because there are other drivers which make the cost of PCB fabrication and assembly lower and more accessible than ever. The general march of technology certainly, but perhaps the presence of mobile devices and a desire to repair and improve them. After all and if the rumors are to be believed, anyone who can find the right Huaqiangbei stall can &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2016/02/03/iphone-flash-storage-upgrade-shenzhen/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;get the NAND replaced in their iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, a once complex process made simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to track the progression of each model as they are primarily covered on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.51nb.com/forum-x62-1.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;51nb forums&lt;/a&gt; (a Facebook page called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/lcdfans/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[Lcdfans]&lt;/a&gt; makes some of the information available in English). However it’s possible to find hands-on information like [koobear]’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/809p2s/brief_review_of_the_x210_from_51nblcdfans/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;review on Reddit.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Making $60k a month from a podcast on software engineering</title>

<description>&lt;h2&gt;Hello! What's your background, and what are you working on?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm Jeff Meyerson, the host of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.softwaredaily.com/&quot;&gt;Software Engineering Daily&lt;/a&gt;. I grew up playing poker competitively and studied computer science in college. I love &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/artist/7ypFFBJINZtKfxN7ez5ZVF&quot;&gt;writing music&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software Engineering Daily is a daily podcast about software topics. Each episode is ~60 minutes and focuses on a specific technology, company, or idea. Our goal is to provide education and entertainment to the listeners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SE Daily gets ~140,000 downloads per week, and we sell $60,000 in ads during a good month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;screenshot-wrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.softwaredaily.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Homepage&quot; src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/indie-hackers.appspot.com/content/software-engineering-daily__homepage.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What motivated you to get started with Software Engineering Daily?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I apprenticed under Robert Blumen, the editor of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.se-radio.net/&quot;&gt;Software Engineering Radio&lt;/a&gt;. SE Radio is the longest-running podcast about software engineering. During the time I volunteered for SE Radio, I saw how passionate the listener base was. An average episode of SE Radio gets 50,000 downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, I frequently ran out of engineering podcasts to listen to. There just wasn't enough software engineering podcast content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What went into building the initial product?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SE Daily was inexpensive to build. I used a cheap WordPress host, a cheap microphone, and free audio editing software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I left Amazon, I had the first 15 interviews scheduled. The interview topics included ReactJS, Bitcoin, and Apache Spark — and I had no experience with any of these technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that is OK — as a podcaster, you don't need to know the right answers. You just need to have good questions. My days were spent studying the unfamiliar topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;screenshot-wrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.softwaredaily.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The early days&quot; src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/indie-hackers.appspot.com/content/software-engineering-daily__early-days.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took long jogs listening to This Week In Startups and James Altucher. I ate baked chicken, broccoli, and sweet potatoes for every meal. I fell in love with a militant routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early days felt so good. I had 60% conviction that this podcast could turn into a business. The downside risk was minimal. Worst-case scenario I would learn a lot. I was in &quot;flow state&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;ember65065&quot; class=&quot;shareable-quote ember-view&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;shareable-quote__quote-wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;shareable-quote__quote&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took long jogs listening to This Week In Startups and James Altucher. I ate baked chicken, broccoli, and sweet potatoes for every meal. I fell in love with a militant routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;shareable-quote__actions&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;shareable-quote__action-text&quot;&gt;Tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;shareable-quote__action-text&quot;&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm grateful that some big names were willing to come on my podcast early on: Stephen Wolfram, Seth Godin, Matei Zaharia, Andreas Antonopoulos. These interviews boosted our popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we validated the revenue model, Pranay Mohan joined me full time. Pranay helped establish the long-term vision for SE Daily — our map to moving beyond the podcast. After he helped get our flywheel spinning, he left to go work for Snap as an engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How have you attracted users and grown Software Engineering Daily?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 2015 I posted the first episode of SE Daily. Since launch we have posted an episode most weekdays. Word of mouth has been our main growth source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;interactive-chart&quot; data-description=&quot;September 2015 to January 2017&quot; data-hover-suffix=&quot; Listeners&quot; data-title=&quot;Podcast Listeners&quot;&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Month&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Listeners&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td data-full-value=&quot;September 1 2015&quot;&gt;Sept 1, '15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1060&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td data-full-value=&quot;January 1 2016&quot;&gt;Jan 1, '16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2580&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td data-full-value=&quot;May 1 2016&quot;&gt;May 1, '16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4416&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td data-full-value=&quot;September 1 2016&quot;&gt;Sept 1, '16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17675&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td data-full-value=&quot;January 1 2017&quot;&gt;Jan 1, '17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;22546&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SE Daily is a two-sided marketplace. One side of the marketplace is advertisers, the other our community. We try to bring those two sides together harmoniously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erika Hokanson joined in 2016 and has scaled our business on every dimension. Erika sees weaknesses and opportunities in SE Daily which I am blind to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We love to get feedback and criticism from our listeners. We work closely with advertisers to make sure we are meeting their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We take inspiration from high-quality, durable media companies. We don't mind growing slowly. The longer it takes for someone to find us, the more content we will have when they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A notable expansion has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/softwareengineeringdaily&quot;&gt;our open source project&lt;/a&gt;. It was started by Keith and Craig Holliday, who are prolific open source developers. It has snowballed into a community of contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's your business model, and how have you grown your revenue?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SE Daily is mostly ad supported. Our iOS, Android, and web apps allow listeners to opt out of ads by paying $10/month or $100/year. We use &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/&quot;&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt; for subscription payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning, Hired and Digital Ocean both took a risk with SE Daily. When I sent them an email, we were under 2,000 listeners. They tested small campaigns (~$2,500 each) and saw positive results. Other direct response brands like Wealthfront followed shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;ember65070&quot; class=&quot;shareable-quote ember-view&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;shareable-quote__quote-wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don't mind growing slowly. The longer it takes for someone to find us, the more content we will have when they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;shareable-quote__actions&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;shareable-quote__action-text&quot;&gt;Tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;shareable-quote__action-text&quot;&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time we have developed outbound and inbound sales. Our advertisers have many choices where to spend their money — we need to make sure that they have a good experience and ROI from SE Daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our monthly ad sales have variance, usually falling between $30-60k. We focus on selling to technology companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podcast ads are an uncommon ad unit, so we need to explain how it works and why it is powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our monthly ad sales fall when we fail to deliver value to our advertisers. Or when we lose focus, or get overconfident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;interactive-chart&quot; data-description=&quot;June 2016 through January 2018&quot; data-hover-prefix=&quot;$&quot; data-hover-suffix=&quot; MR&quot; data-title=&quot;Monthly Revenue&quot; data-y-axis-prefix=&quot;$&quot;&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Month&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Revenue&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td data-full-value=&quot;June 2016&quot;&gt;Jun '16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;18000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td data-full-value=&quot;September 2016&quot;&gt;Sep '16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;31100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td data-full-value=&quot;January 2017&quot;&gt;Jan '17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;36000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td data-full-value=&quot;April 2017&quot;&gt;Apr '17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;44100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td data-full-value=&quot;June 2017&quot;&gt;Jun '17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;52500&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td data-full-value=&quot;September 2017&quot;&gt;Sep '17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;35100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td data-full-value=&quot;January 2018&quot;&gt;Jan '18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;64000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are your goals for the future?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Producing high-quality content remains the focus of SE Daily. From that core competency, we tinker with adjacent businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason Bautista joined us full time as a software engineer and designer. He is an engine of creative expansion — a da Vinci type who has a wellspring of ideas, but also the discipline to materialize singular features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://softwareengineeringdaily.github.io&quot;&gt;Software Daily open source project&lt;/a&gt; is a place for people to socialize and collaborate on software. We welcome anyone who is looking to build software — engineer or not. Expert or novice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;screenshot-wrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.softwaredaily.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The early days&quot; src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/indie-hackers.appspot.com/content/software-engineering-daily__blog.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I have two other projects: Adforprize and my music. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adforprize.com/homepage.html&quot;&gt;Adforprize&lt;/a&gt; is a marketplace for creative videos. In music, &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/the_prion&quot;&gt;I'm working on my 6th album&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the biggest challenges you've faced and obstacles you've overcome? If you had to start over, what would you do differently?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My years playing poker in high school and college were formative. Poker was a good way to learn about myself — to explore risk, psychology, and math. Poker exposed me to the variance of the universe, and let me sample the pain it can bring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was 19 there was a month when I played poorly and lost ~$250k. I quit shortly after that. It took me awhile to recover my psychological bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I quit poker, I felt lost for the next two years. Luckily, I was in college, which is a good place to be lost in. I tried out several majors. Finding computer science gave me something new to be excited about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to start over I would prioritize health — exercise, diet, sleep, socialization, getting outside for fresh air. I would be nicer to those who love me, and try to opt for kindness over cleverness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Have you found anything particularly helpful or advantageous?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a mental library of people that I am trying to understand. I like to imagine the world through their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many learners like myself are turning away from studying books and turning towards studying people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Books offer a condensed manifesto. With Twitter, podcasts, and YouTube you can get a kaleidoscopic view of a person's total idea set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By focusing on people, you get exposed to their beliefs, habits, diets, exercise routines, conversational tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;ember65075&quot; class=&quot;shareable-quote ember-view&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;shareable-quote__quote-wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;shareable-quote__quote&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many learners like myself are turning away from studying books and turning towards studying people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;shareable-quote__actions&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;shareable-quote__action-text&quot;&gt;Tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;shareable-quote__action-text&quot;&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's useful to explore the &quot;intellectual dark web&quot;: Sam Harris, Joe Rogan, Jocko Willink, Tim Ferriss. The business equivalents are people like Peter Thiel, Jason Calacanis, Vitalik Buterin, Auren Hoffman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Posters around my apartment have long-term thinking aphorisms: &quot;Get rich slow,&quot; &quot;If you don't know what you want you are unlikely to get it,&quot; &quot;Begin with the end in mind.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;screenshot-wrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.softwaredaily.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The early days&quot; src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/indie-hackers.appspot.com/content/software-engineering-daily__home-studio.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoy healthy mind expansion activities: cooking unintuitive meals, sampling trendy exercise routines, encouraging taboo conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got extremely lucky with my parents. My mom is an entrepreneur. My dad became a doctor because he likes to talk to people — he taught me to ask questions. They gave me all the tools I need to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, my friend Edaena Salinas has encouraged my creativity since college. Having a friend who will take you seriously and believe in your artistic/entrepreneurial ideas really helps. She now runs &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewomenintechshow.com/&quot;&gt;The Women in Tech Show&lt;/a&gt; and is inspiring many more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's your advice for indie hackers who are just starting out?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are special. We need you. There is something unique inside of you that nobody else can create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Push yourself harder. Exercise more. Take in more information. Run more experiments. Build convictions about what you hold true. Adopt the &quot;9-9-6&quot; mentality of the Chinese tech workforce. (Work from 9am to 9pm, six days a week.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a long-term vision. Determine where you want to be in 10 years, and work backwards from that goal until you get to the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Greene and Seth Godin are my author picks for someone starting out. Listen to some podcasts/YouTube interviews with them. If you like that material pick up Mastery or Icarus Deception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where can we go to learn more?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love to connect with new people. Please reach out if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;you have feedback on SE Daily (or if you want to advertise with us)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you want to collaborate on music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you have experience with online advertising&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please ask questions or offer feedback in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Want to build your own business like Software Engineering Daily?&lt;/h2&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rough.js&lt;/strong&gt; is a light weight (~8k), &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API&quot;&gt;Canvas&lt;/a&gt; based library that lets you draw in a &lt;em&gt;sketchy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;hand-drawn-like&lt;/em&gt;, style. The library defines primitives to draw lines, curves, arcs, polygons, circles, and ellipses. It also supports drawing &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Paths&quot;&gt;SVG paths&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pshihn/workly&quot;&gt;Workly&lt;/a&gt; imported on your web page (~1k only), RoughJS will automatically offload all processing to a web worker - freeing up your main UI thread. This is great when creating complex drawings using RoughJs like maps.

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;177&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which Web sites get the most traffic? According to the ranking service Alexa, the top three sites in the United States, as of this writing, are Google, YouTube, and Facebook. (Porn, somewhat hearteningly, doesn’t crack the top ten.) The rankings don’t reflect everything—the dark Web, the nouveau-riche recluses harvesting bitcoin—but, for the most part, people online go where you’d expect them to go. The only truly surprising entry, in fourth place, is Reddit, whose astronomical popularity seems at odds with the fact that many Americans have only vaguely heard of the site and have no real understanding of what it is. A link aggregator? A microblogging platform? A social network?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To its devotees, Reddit feels proudly untamed, one of the last Internet giants to resist homogeneity. Most Reddit pages have a throwback aesthetic, with a few crudely designed graphics and a tangle of text: an original post, comments on the post, responses to the comments, responses to the responses. That’s pretty much it. Reddit is made up of more than a million individual communities, or subreddits, some of which have three subscribers, some twenty million. Every subreddit is devoted to a specific kind of content, ranging from vital to trivial: r/News, r/Politics, r/Trees (for marijuana enthusiasts), r/MarijuanaEnthusiasts (for tree enthusiasts), r/MildlyInteresting (“for photos that are, you know, mildly interesting”). Some people end up on Reddit by accident, find it baffling, and never visit again. But people who do use it—redditors, as they’re called—often use it all day long, to the near-exclusion of anything else. “For a while, we called ourselves the front page of the Internet,” Steve Huffman, Reddit’s C.E.O., said recently. “These days, I tend to say that we’re a place for open and honest conversations—‘open and honest’ meaning authentic, meaning messy, meaning the best and worst and realest and weirdest parts of humanity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 23, 2016, shortly after President Trump’s election, Huffman was at his desk, in San Francisco, perusing the site. It was the day before Thanksgiving. Reddit’s administrators had just deleted a subreddit called r/Pizzagate, a forum for people who believed that high-ranking staffers of Hillary Clinton’s Presidential campaign, and possibly Clinton herself, were trafficking child sex slaves. The evidence, as extensive as it was unpersuasive, included satanic rituals, a map printed on a handkerchief, and an elaborate code involving the words “cheese” and “pizza.” In only fifteen days of existence, the Pizzagate subreddit had attracted twenty thousand subscribers. Now, in its place, was a scrubbed white page with the message “This community has been banned.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for the ban, according to Reddit’s administrators, was not the beliefs of people on the subreddit, but the way they’d behaved—specifically, their insistence on publishing their enemies’ private phone numbers and addresses, a clear violation of Reddit’s rules. The conspiracy theorists, in turn, claimed that they’d been banned because Reddit administrators were part of the conspiracy. (Less than two weeks after Pizzagate was banned, a man fired a semiautomatic rifle inside a D.C. pizzeria called Comet Ping Pong, in an attempt to “self-investigate” claims that the restaurant’s basement was a dungeon full of kidnapped children. Comet Ping Pong does not have a basement.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the conspiracy theorists left Reddit and reunited on Voat, a site made by and for the users that Reddit sloughs off. (Many social networks have such Bizarro networks, which brand themselves as strongholds of free speech and in practice are often used for hate speech. People banned from Twitter end up on Gab; people banned from Patreon end up on Hatreon.) Other Pizzagaters stayed and regrouped on r/The_Donald, a popular pro-Trump subreddit. Throughout the Presidential campaign, The_Donald was a hive of Trump boosterism. By this time, it had become a hermetic subculture, full of inside jokes and ugly rhetoric. The community’s most frequent commenters, like the man they’d helped propel to the Presidency, were experts at testing boundaries. Within minutes, they started to express their outrage that Pizzagate had been deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redditors are pseudonymous, and their pseudonyms are sometimes prefaced by “u,” for “username.” Huffman’s is Spez. As he scanned The_Donald, he noticed that hundreds of the most popular comments were about him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“fuck u/spez”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“u/spez is complicit in the coverup”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“u/spez supports &lt;em class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;child rape&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One commenter simply wrote “u/&lt;em class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;SPEZ IS A CUCK&lt;/em&gt;,” in bold type, a hundred and ten times in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huffman, alone at his computer, wondered whether to respond. “I consider myself a troll at heart,” he said later. “Making people bristle, being a little outrageous in order to add some spice to life—I get that. I’ve done that.” Privately, Huffman imagined The_Donald as a misguided teen-ager who wouldn’t stop misbehaving. “If your little brother flicks your ear, maybe you ignore it,” he said. “If he flicks your ear a hundred times, or punches you, then maybe you give him a little smack to show you’re paying attention.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO&quot;&gt;“He’s unbeatable on carpet.”&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although redditors didn’t yet know it, Huffman could edit any part of the site. He wrote a script that would automatically replace his username with those of The_Donald’s most prominent members, directing the insults back at the insulters in real time: in one comment, “Fuck u/Spez” became “Fuck u/Trumpshaker”; in another, “Fuck u/Spez” became “Fuck u/MAGAdocious.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The_Donald’s users saw what was happening, and they reacted by spinning a conspiracy theory that, in this case, turned out to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Manipulating the words of your users is fucked,” a commenter wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even Facebook and Twitter haven’t stooped this low.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Trust nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident became known as Spezgiving, and it’s still invoked, internally and externally, as a paradigmatic example of tech-executive overreach. Social-media platforms must do something to rein in their users, the consensus goes, but not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huffman can no longer edit the site indiscriminately, but his actions laid bare a fact that most social-media companies go to great lengths to conceal—that, no matter how neutral a platform may seem, there’s always a person behind the curtain. “I fucked up,” Huffman wrote in an apology the following week. “More than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal.” Implicit in his apology was a set of questions, perhaps the central questions facing anyone who worries about the current state of civic discourse. Is it possible to facilitate a space for open dialogue without also facilitating hoaxes, harassment, and threats of violence? Where is the line between authenticity and toxicity? What if, after technology allows us to reveal our inner voices, what we learn is that many of us are authentically toxic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;162&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to understand the Internet, at least at first, was by metaphor. “Web” and “page” and “superhighway” are metaphors. So are “link,” “viral,” “post,” and “stream.” Last year, the Supreme Court heard a case about whether it was constitutional to bar registered sex offenders from using social media. In order to answer that question, the Justices had to ask another question: What is social media? In sixty minutes of oral argument, Facebook was compared to a park, a playground, an airport terminal, a polling place, and a town square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be most helpful to compare a social network to a party. The party starts out small, with the hosts and a few of their friends. Then word gets out and strangers show up. People take cues from the environment. Mimosas in a sun-dappled atrium suggest one kind of mood; grain alcohol in a moldy basement suggests another. Sometimes, a pattern emerges on its own. Pinterest, a simple photo-sharing site founded by three men, happened to catch on among women aspiring to an urbane life style, and today the front page is often a collage of merino scarves and expensive glassware. In other cases, the gatekeeping seems more premeditated. If you’re fourteen, Snapchat’s user interface is intuitive; if you’re twenty-two, it’s intriguing; if you’re over thirty-five, it’s impenetrable. This encourages old people to self-deport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huffman and his college roommate, Alexis Ohanian, founded Reddit a few weeks after graduating from the University of Virginia, in 2005. The first people to show up were, like the co-founders, the kind of strong-headed young men who got excited about computer programming, video games, and edgy, self-referential humor. Reddit’s system was purely democratic, which is to say anarchic. Anyone could post any link, and the ones that got the most “upvotes” would rise to the top of a page. At the time, Facebook was available only to college students, and before joining it you had to provide your real name, your birthday, and a valid school e-mail address—the equivalent of being carded at the door. To join Reddit, all you needed was a username that hadn’t been claimed yet. You could start as many anonymous accounts as you wanted, which gave rise to creativity, and also to mischief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then, Ohanian was ungainly and clean-shaven, and he was often photographed in a hoodie and with a goofy smile. At his wedding, last year, wearing a beard and an Armani tuxedo, he was nearly unrecognizable. (The paparazzi weren’t too interested in him, though, given that his bride was Serena Williams.) Huffman, on the other hand, has always looked more or less the same: bright-blue eyes, chipmunk teeth, and a thatch of blond hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months after Reddit launched, Huffman created the first constraints. People were posting links to vulgar and violent content—which was fine, except that Huffman wanted users to have some idea of what they were about to click on, so that they could avoid, say, inadvertently opening porn in front of their bosses. Huffman labelled some content N.S.F.W.—not safe for work—and separated it from everything else. That was the end of pure democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2006, Ohanian and Huffman sold Reddit to Condé Nast, a media conglomerate that owns more than twenty magazines, including this one. (Reddit now operates independently.) The sale made them twenty-two-year-old millionaires, but they didn’t fit in at a large corporation, and three years later they left. In their absence, the party got bigger and weirder, and ominous cliques started to gather in the corners. One popular subreddit, r/Jailbait, was devoted to sexually suggestive photos of young-looking women. This was profoundly creepy, but probably not illegal—the subreddit’s users swore that all the women in the photos were eighteen or older—and Reddit allowed the community to grow. In September of 2011, Anderson Cooper discussed the subreddit on CNN. “It’s pretty amazing that a big corporation would have something like this, which reflects badly on it,” he said. Traffic to Jailbait quadrupled overnight. Twelve days later, after someone in the group apparently shared a nude photo of a fourteen-year-old girl, the community was banned. And yet the founder of Jailbait, an infamous troll who went by u/Violentacrez, was allowed to stay on Reddit, as were some four hundred other communities he’d created—r/Jewmerica, r/ChokeABitch, and worse. (Yes, it gets worse.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yishan Wong, an engineer who had worked at Facebook, was then Reddit’s C.E.O. He implied that he’d banned Jailbait only because the subreddit had violated U.S. law. “We stand for free speech,” he wrote in an internal post, in 2012. Reddit’s goal, he continued, was to “become a universal platform for human discourse.” Therefore, “it would not do if, in our youth, we decided to censor things simply because they were distasteful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, Wong’s free-speech absolutism was ubiquitous in Silicon Valley. Twitter’s executives referred to their company as “the free-speech wing of the free-speech party.” Facebook’s original self-description, “an online directory that connects people through social networks at colleges,” had evolved into a grandiose mission statement: “Facebook gives people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.” With the Arab Spring fresh in everyone’s mind, few questioned the assumption that “giving people the power” would inevitably lead to social progress. Barack Obama, who had been carried into office by a social-media groundswell, often expressed a similar optimism about the salubrious effects of the Internet. “In the twenty-first century, information is power,” Obama said in a 2011 speech on Middle East policy. “The truth cannot be hidden. . . . Such open discourse is important even if what is said does not square with our worldview.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wong left the company in 2014, after two and a half years. His successor was Ellen Pao, a former venture capitalist. She lasted eight months. Early in her tenure, Reddit announced a crackdown on involuntary pornography. If you found a compromising photo of yourself circulating on Reddit without your consent, you could report it and the company would remove it. In retrospect, this seems like a straightforward business decision, but some redditors treated it as the first in an inevitable parade of horrors. “This rule is stupid and suppresses our rights,” u/penisfuckermcgee commented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months later, Reddit banned five of its most egregious communities, including r/FatPeopleHate and r/ShitNiggersSay. Again redditors were apoplectic (“We may as well take a one way ticket to North Korea”). Almost every day, strident misogynists called Pao a tyrant, an “Asian slut,” or worse. (Yes, it gets worse.) She resigned in July, 2015. “The Internet started as a bastion for free expression,” she wrote in the Washington &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;. “But that balancing act is getting harder. The trolls are winning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;185.58098174057&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, social networks have turned into institutions. More than two billion people now use Facebook. In other words, the company has achieved its mission of making the world more connected. In 2016, that meant, among other things, making the American electorate more connected to white supremacists, armed militias, Macedonian fake-news merchants, and micro-targeted campaign ads purchased in rubles. “I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be President,” Obama said that year, despite the mounting aggression in some online forums. “And the reason is because I have a lot of faith in the American people.” (In response to Obama’s remarks, a commenter on The_Donald wrote, “&lt;em class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;FUCK THAT LOW ENERGY CUCK&lt;/em&gt;!”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the election, Brad Parscale, the Trump campaign’s top digital strategist, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2016/11/facebook-won-trump-election-not-just-fake-news/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “Facebook and Twitter were the reason we won this thing.” Reddit was also an important part of Trump’s strategy. Parscale wrote—on Reddit, naturally—that “members here provided considerable growth and reach to our campaign.” The_Donald, in particular, proved a fecund host cell for viral memes. On July 2, 2016, Trump tweeted a photo collage of Hillary Clinton, piles of cash, and the phrase “Most Corrupt Candidate Ever!” written inside a six-pointed star. When Trump’s critics called attention to the image’s anti-Semitic implications, The_Donald’s users rushed to Trump’s defense, posting photos of other six-pointed stars in innocuous contexts. “Where is the outrage from the liberal left on this one?” a user wrote, beneath a photo of a “Frozen”-themed sticker book with a star on its cover. A few hours later, Trump tweeted the same photo, with a version of the same question, followed by “Dishonest media! #Frozen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the campaign, Trump, or someone typing on his behalf, participated in Reddit’s signature interview format—an A.M.A., for “ask me anything.” In response to a question about the “protected class of media elites,” Trump wrote, “I have been very concerned about media bias and the total dishonesty of the press. I think new media is a great way to get out the truth.” This drew hundreds of jubilant comments (u/&lt;em class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;RAINBOW&lt;/em&gt;_&lt;em class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;DILDO&lt;/em&gt;: “daddy &lt;em class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;YES&lt;/em&gt;”; u/CantContheDon: “&lt;em class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;WE’RE THE MEDIA NOW&lt;/em&gt;”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The_Donald, with more than half a million subscribers, is by far the biggest pro-Trump subreddit, but it ranks just below No. 150 on the list of all subreddits; it’s roughly the same size as r/CryptoCurrency and r/ComicBooks. “Some people on The_Donald are expressing their genuine political beliefs, and obviously that’s something we want to encourage,” Huffman said. “Others are maybe not expressing sincere beliefs, but are treating it more like a game—If I post this ridiculous or offensive thing, can I get people to upvote it? And then some people, to quote ‘The Dark Knight,’ just want to watch the world burn.” On some smaller far-right subreddits, the discourse is more unhinged. One, created in July of 2016, was called r/Physical_Removal. According to its “About Us” section, it was a subreddit for people who believe that liberals “qualify to get a helicopter ride.” “Helicopter ride,” an allusion to Augusto Pinochet’s reputed habit of throwing Communists out of helicopters, is alt-right slang for murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The_Donald accounts for less than one per cent of Reddit’s traffic, but it occupies far more than one per cent of the Reddit-wide conversation. Trolls set a cunning trap. By ignoring their provocations, you risk seeming complicit. By responding, you amplify their message. Trump, perhaps the world’s most skilled troll, can get attention whenever he wants, simply by being outrageous. Traditional journalists and editors can decide to resist the bait, and sometimes they do, but that option isn’t available on user-generated platforms. Social-media executives claim to transcend subjectivity, and they have designed their platforms to be feedback machines, giving us not what we claim to want, nor what might be good for us, but what we actually pay attention to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no good solutions to this problem, and so tech executives tend to discuss it as seldom as possible, and only in the airiest of platitudes. Twitter has rebuffed repeated calls to ban President Trump’s account, despite his many apparent violations of company policy. (If tweeting that North Korea “won’t be around much longer” doesn’t break Twitter’s rule against “specific threats of violence,” it’s not clear what would.) Last fall, on his Facebook page, Mark Zuckerberg addressed—sort of, obliquely—the widespread critique that his company was exacerbating political polarization. “We’ll keep working to ensure the integrity of free and fair elections around the world, and to ensure our community is a platform for all ideas and force for good in democracy,” he wrote, then stepped away as a global howl of frustration grew in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;CartoonEmbed__container___vf5AM&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Image__image___1PhYl&quot; role=&quot;button&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5aa0831e09d3ca28d8f47d0b/master/w_727,c_limit/180319_a21483.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked a few social-media executives to talk to me about all this. I didn’t expect definitive answers, I told them; I just wanted to hear them think through the questions. Unsurprisingly, no one jumped at the chance. Twitter mostly ignored my e-mails. Snapchat’s P.R. representatives had breakfast with me once, then ignored my e-mails. Facebook’s representatives talked to me for weeks, asking precise, intelligent questions, before they started to ignore my e-mails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit has more reason to be transparent. It’s big, but doesn’t feel indispensable to most Internet users or, for that matter, to most advertisers. Moreover, Anderson Cooper’s CNN segment was hardly the only bit of vividly terrible press that Reddit has received over the years. All social networks contain vitriol and bigotry, but not all social networks are equally associated with these things in the public imagination. Recently, I typed “Reddit is” into Google. Three of the top suggested auto-completions were “toxic,” “cancer,” and “hot garbage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huffman, after leaving Condé Nast, spent a few months backpacking in Costa Rica, then founded a travel company called Hipmunk. In July, 2015, he returned to Reddit as C.E.O. In a post about his “top priority” in the job, he wrote, “The overwhelming majority of content on reddit comes from wonderful, creative, funny, smart, and silly communities. There is also a dark side, communities whose purpose is reprehensible, and we don’t have any obligation to support them. . . . Neither Alexis nor I created reddit to be a bastion of free speech.” This was shocking, and about half true. When free-speech absolutism was in vogue, Reddit’s co-founders were as susceptible to its appeal as anyone. In 2012, a &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; reporter asked Ohanian how the Founding Fathers might have reacted to Reddit. “A bastion of free speech on the World Wide Web? I bet they would like it,” Ohanian &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/02/reddit-co-founder-alexis-ohanians-rosy-outlook-on-the-future-of-politics/3/#6a0fdcf86c46&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt;. “I would love to imagine that ‘Common Sense’ would have been a self-post on Reddit, by Thomas Paine, or actually a redditor named T_Paine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Ohanian and Huffman never took their own rhetoric too literally. The site’s rules were brief and vague, and their unwritten policy was even simpler. “We always banned people,” Huffman told me. “We just didn’t talk about it very much.” Because Reddit was so small, and misbehavior relatively rare, Huffman could do most of the banning himself, on an ad-hoc basis. “It wasn’t well thought out or even articulated, really. It was ‘That guy has the N-word in his username? Fuck that.’ Delete account.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As C.E.O., Huffman continued the trend Pao had started, banning a few viciously racist subreddits such as r/Coontown. “There was pushback,” Huffman told me. “But I had the moral authority, as the founder, to take it in stride.” If Pao was like a forbearing parent, then Huffman’s style was closer to “I brought you into this world, and I can take you out of it.” “Yes, I know that it’s really hard to define hate speech, and I know that any way we define it has the potential to set a dangerous precedent,” he told me. “I also know that a community called Coontown is not good for Reddit.” In most cases, Reddit didn’t suspend individual users’ accounts, Huffman said: “We just took away the spaces where they liked to hang out, and went, ‘Let’s see if this helps.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;66&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit’s headquarters, in a former radio tower in downtown San Francisco, look like a stereotypical startup office: high concrete ceilings, a large common area with beer and kombucha on tap. Each desk is decorated aggressively with personal flair—a “Make Reddit Great Again” hat, a glossy print magazine called &lt;em&gt;Meme Insider&lt;/em&gt;. Working at Reddit requires paying close anthropological attention to the motley tastes of redditors, and it’s not uncommon to see groups of fit, well-dressed employees cheerfully discussing the most recent post on r/CatDimension or r/PeopleFuckingDying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first morning I visited the office, I ran into Huffman, who was wearing jeans, a T-shirt, and Adidas indoor-soccer shoes, as he tried to persuade an employee to buy a ticket to Burning Man. Huffman is far more unfiltered than other social-media executives, and every time he and I talked in the presence of Reddit’s head of P.R., he said at least one thing that made her wince. “There’s only one Steve,” Ohanian told me. “No matter when you catch him, for better or worse, that’s the Steve you’re gonna get.” I had a list of delicate topics that I planned to ask Huffman about eventually, including allegations of vote manipulation on Reddit’s front page and his personal feelings about Trump. Huffman raised all of them himself on the first day. “My political views might not be exactly what you’d predict,” he said. “I’m a gun owner, for example. And I don’t care all that much about politics, compared to other things.” He speaks in quick bursts, with an alpha-nerd combination of introversion and confidence. His opinion about Trump is that he is incompetent and that his Presidency has mostly been a failure. But, he told me, “I’m open to counterarguments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That afternoon, I watched Huffman make a sales pitch to a group of executives from a New York advertising agency. Like many platforms, Reddit has struggled to convert its huge audience into a stable revenue stream, and its representatives spend a lot of time trying to convince potential advertisers that Reddit is not hot garbage. Huffman sat at the head of a long table, facing a dozen men and women in suits. The “snarky, libertarian” ethos of early Reddit, he said, “mostly came from me as a twenty-one-year-old. I’ve since grown out of that, to the relief of everyone.” The executives nodded and chuckled. “We had a lot of baggage,” he continued. “We let the story get away from us. And now we’re trying to get our shit together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, Huffman told me that getting Reddit’s shit together would require continual intervention. “I don’t think I’m going to leave the office one Friday and go, ‘Mission accomplished—we fixed the Internet,’ ” he said. “Every day, you keep visiting different parts of the site, opening this random door or that random door—‘What’s it like in here? Does this feel like a shitty place to be? No, people are generally having a good time, nobody’s hatching any evil plots, nobody’s crying. O.K., great.’ And you move on to the next room.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January, Facebook announced that it would make news less visible in its users’ feeds. “Facebook was originally designed to connect friends and family—and it has excelled at that,” a product manager named Samidh Chakrabarti wrote on a company blog. “But as unprecedented numbers of people channel their political energy through this medium, it’s being used in unforeseen ways with societal repercussions that were never anticipated.” It wasn’t the most effusive mea culpa in history, but by Facebook’s standards it amounted to wailing and gnashing of teeth. “We want to make sure that our products are not just fun, but are good for people,” Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/technology/facebook-news-feed.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Direct pronouncements from him are so rare that even this pabulum was treated as push-alert-worthy news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, although Facebook denies this, it seems clear that the company was preparing for a blow that was about to land. On February 16th, the special counsel Robert Mueller filed an indictment against several Russian individuals and businesses, including the Internet Research Agency, a company aligned with the Kremlin. The indictment mentioned Facebook thirty-five times, and not in ways that made the platform seem like a “force for good in democracy.” According to recent reporting by the Daily Beast, the Internet Research Agency also seeded Reddit with disinformation during the 2016 election. (A group of impostors even tried to set up an A.M.A.) Last Monday, the Washington &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/03/05/senate-investigators-want-answers-from-reddit-and-tumblr-on-russia-meddling/?utm_term=.16f984d510f2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the Senate Intelligence Committee will question Reddit executives about this; the same day, Huffman admitted that the company had “found and removed a few hundred accounts” associated with Russian propaganda. (A Reddit representative told me that the company has been coöperating with congressional investigators “for months,” although they haven’t spoken about it publicly.) As in all such disinformation campaigns, the Russians did not act alone: their messages were upvoted and repeated by thousands of unsuspecting Americans. “I believe the biggest risk we face as Americans is our own ability to discern reality from nonsense,” Huffman wrote. “I wish there was a solution as simple as banning all propaganda, but it’s not that easy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg recently set a “personal challenge” for himself: “enforcing our policies and preventing misuse of our tools.” This seems to be a reversal for Zuckerberg, who was once a fake-news truther. Two days after the 2016 election, he said, “The idea that fake news on Facebook, of which it’s a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way, I think, is a pretty crazy idea. Voters make decisions based on their lived experience.” This was a pretty crazy idea, and Zuckerberg has been walking it back ever since. It’s obvious that what we see online affects how we think and feel. We know this in part because Facebook has done research on it. In 2012, without notice or permission, Facebook tweaked the feeds of nearly seven hundred thousand of its users, showing one group more posts containing “positive emotional content” and the other more “negative emotional content.” Two years later, Facebook declassified the experiment and published the results. Users were livid, and, after that, Facebook either stopped conducting secret experiments or stopped admitting to them. But the results of the experiment were clear: the people with happier feeds acted happier, and vice versa. The study’s authors called it “massive-scale emotional contagion.” Since then, social media has only grown in size and influence, and the persuasive tools available to advertisers, spies, politicians, and propagandists have only become sharper. During the 2016 election, a few Russian impostors affected many Americans’ beliefs and, presumably, votes. With another election coming up, most of the loopholes that the Russians exploited have not been closed, and the main loophole—the open, connected, massively contagious world of social media—might not be closable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I raised this issue with Huffman over dinner last summer, he said, “I go back and forth on whether Reddit is the tail or the dog. I think it’s a bit of both.” First, he laid out the tail hypothesis: “Reddit is a reflection of reality. People are enthusiastic about Bernie or Trump in real life, so they go on Reddit and talk about how much they like Bernie or Trump. So far, so good.” Then he laid out the dog hypothesis, which his fellow social-media executives almost never acknowledge—that reality is also a reflection of social media. “All sorts of weird things can happen online,” he said. “Imagine I post a joke where the point is to be offensive—like, to imply, ‘This is something that a racist person would say’—but you misread the context and think, ‘Yeah, that racist guy has a good point.’ That kind of dynamic, I think, explains a lot of what happened on The_Donald, at least in the early days—someone keeps pushing a joke or a meme to see how far they can take it, and the answer turns out to be Pretty fucking far.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leftist communities on Reddit often implore the company to ban The_Donald. So far, Huffman has demurred. “There are arguments on both sides,” he said, “but, ultimately, my view is that their anger comes from feeling like they don’t have a voice, so it won’t solve anything if I take away their voice.” He thought of something else to say, but decided against it. Then he took a swig of beer and said it anyway. “I’m confident that Reddit could sway elections,” he told me. “We wouldn’t do it, of course. And I don’t know how many times we could get away with it. But, if we really wanted to, I’m sure Reddit could have swayed at least this election, this once.” That’s a terrifying thought. It’s also almost certainly true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;240&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 11th, Huffman’s alma mater, the University of Virginia, was overrun by white nationalists carrying torches. “I was on a plane when I saw the news, and I got really emotional,” Huffman said. He told his employees, “If any of these people are on Reddit, I want them gone. Nuke ’em.” This felt cathartic, but personal catharsis is an awful way to make policy. “Luckily, my team knew me well enough to go, ‘Steve, you’re pissed off right now. Let’s talk about it more rationally on Monday.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early the next week, Reddit banned Physical_Removal. In Charlottesville, James Alex Fields, one of the white nationalists, had driven a car into a crowd of counterprotesters, injuring nineteen and killing a woman named Heather Heyer. “This is a good thing,” the top post on Physical_Removal read. “They are mockeries of life and need to fucking go.” Reddit had a rule prohibiting content that “encourages or incites violence,” and this was a violation of that rule. Huffman said, “We’d had our eye on that community for a while, and it felt good to get rid of them, I have to say. But it still didn’t feel like enough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Encouraging or inciting violence” was a narrow standard, and Huffman and his team agreed to expand it. Four words became thirty-six: “Do not post content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or a group of people; likewise, do not post content that glorifies or encourages the abuse of animals.” This, too, required interpretation, and forced the company to create a non-exhaustive list of exceptions (“educational, newsworthy, artistic, satire, documentary”). Still, it made the team’s intentions clearer. Jessica Ashooh, Reddit’s head of policy, spent four years as a policy consultant in Abu Dhabi. “I know what it’s like to live under censorship,” she said. “My internal check, when I’m arguing for a restrictive policy on the site, is Do I sound like an Arab government? If so, maybe I should scale it back.” On the other hand, she said, “people hide behind the notion that there’s a bright line between ideology and action, but some ideologies are inherently more violent than others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October, on the morning the new policy was rolled out, Ashooh sat at a long conference table with a dozen other employees. Before each of them was a laptop, a mug of coffee, and a few hours’ worth of snacks. “Welcome to the Policy Update War Room,” she said. “And, yes, I’m aware of the irony of calling it a war room when the point is to make Reddit less violent, but it’s too late to change the name.” The job of policing Reddit’s most pernicious content falls primarily to three groups of employees—the community team, the trust-and-safety team, and the anti-evil team—which are sometimes described, respectively, as good cop, bad cop, and RoboCop. Community stays in touch with a cross-section of redditors, asking them for feedback and encouraging them to be on their best behavior. When this fails and redditors break the rules, trust and safety punishes them. Anti-evil, a team of back-end engineers, makes software that flags dodgy-looking content and sends that content to humans, who decide what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashooh went over the plan for the day. All at once, they would replace the old policy with the new policy, post an announcement explaining the new policy, warn a batch of subreddits that they were probably in violation of the new policy, and ban another batch of subreddits that were flagrantly, irredeemably in violation. I glanced at a spreadsheet with a list of the hundred and nine subreddits that were about to be banned (r/KKK, r/KillAllJews, r/KilltheJews, r/KilltheJoos), followed by the name of the employee who would carry out each deletion, and, if applicable, the reason for the ban (“mostly just swastikas?”). “Today we’re focussing on a lot of Nazi stuff and bestiality stuff,” Ashooh said. “Context matters, of course, and you shouldn’t get in trouble for posting a swastika if it’s a historical photo from the 1936 Olympics, or if you’re using it as a Hindu symbol. But, even so, there’s a lot that’s clear-cut.” I asked whether the same logic—that the Nazi flag was an inherently violent symbol—would apply to the Confederate flag, or the Soviet flag, or the flag under which King Richard fought the Crusades. “We can have those conversations in the future,” Ashooh said. “But we have to start somewhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 10 &lt;em class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;m&lt;/em&gt;., the trust-and-safety team posted the announcement and began the purge. “Thank you for letting me do DylannRoofInnocent,” one employee said. “That was one of the ones I really wanted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is ReallyWackyTicTacs?” another employee asked, looking down the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Trust me, you don’t want to know,” Ashooh said. “That was the most unpleasant shit I’ve ever seen, and I’ve spent a lot of time looking into Syrian war crimes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the comments on the announcement were cynical. “They don’t actually want to change anything,” one redditor wrote, arguing that the bans were meant to appease advertisers. “It was, in fact, never about free speech, it was about money.” One trust-and-safety manager, a young woman wearing a leather jacket and a ship captain’s cap, was in charge of monitoring the comments and responding to the most relevant ones. “Everyone seems to be taking it pretty well so far,” she said. “There’s one guy, freespeechwarrior, who seems very pissed, but I guess that makes sense, given his username.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People are making lists of all the Nazi subs getting banned, but nobody has noticed that we’re banning bestiality ones at the same time,” Ashooh said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No one wants to admit it,” an employee said. “ ‘Guys, I was just browsing r/HorseCock and I couldn’t help but notice . . .’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman in the captain’s cap said, “O.K., someone just asked, ‘How will the exact phrase “kill yourself” be handled?’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It all depends on context,” Ashooh said. “They’re going to get tired of hearing that, but it’s true.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Uh-oh, looks like we missed a bestiality sub,” the woman in the captain’s cap said. “Apparently, SexWithDogs was on our list, but DogSex was not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Did you go to DogSex?” Ashooh said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yep.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And what’s on it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I mean . . .”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are there people having sex with dogs?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, yes, very much.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, ban it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m going to get more cheese sticks,” the woman in the captain’s cap said, standing up. “How many cheese sticks is too many in one day? At what point am I encouraging or glorifying violence against my own body?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It all depends on context,” Ashooh said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understood why other companies had been reluctant to let me see something like this. Never again would I be able to read a lofty phrase about a social-media company’s shift in policy—“open and connected,” or “encouraging meaningful interactions”—without imagining a group of people sitting around a conference room, eating free snacks and making fallible decisions. Social networks, no matter how big they get or how familiar they seem, are not ineluctable forces but experimental technologies built by human beings. We can tell ourselves that these human beings aren’t gatekeepers, or that they have cleansed themselves of all bias and emotion, but this would have no relation to reality. “I have biases, like everyone else,” Huffman told me once. “I just work really hard to make sure that they don’t prevent me from doing what’s right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world, a thirty-four-year-old in soccer shoes wouldn’t have such fearsome power. In the world we live in, the least social-media executives can do is acknowledge that power. Last November, a group of computer scientists at three universities published a study called “You Can’t Stay Here: The Efficacy of Reddit’s 2015 Ban Examined Through Hate Speech.” They parsed a data set of a hundred million Reddit posts. Did the ban “diminish hateful behavior” over all, or did it merely “relocate such behavior to different parts of the site”? They concluded that the ban had worked: “Users participating in the banned subreddits either left the site or (for those who remained) dramatically reduced their hate speech usage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melissa Tidwell, Reddit’s general counsel, told me, “I am so tired of people who repeat the mantra ‘Free speech!’ but then have nothing else to say. Look, free speech is obviously a great ideal to strive toward. Who doesn’t love freedom? Who doesn’t love speech? But then, in practice, every day, gray areas come up.” Earlier that day, I’d watched Tidwell and a colleague spend several minutes debating whether a soft-core porn subreddit, r/GentlemenBoners, should be included in standard search results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Does free speech mean literally anyone can say anything at any time?” Tidwell continued. “Or is it actually more conducive to the free exchange of ideas if we create a platform where women and people of color can say what they want without thousands of people screaming, ‘Fuck you, light yourself on fire, I know where you live’? If your entire answer to that very difficult question is ‘Free speech,’ then, I’m sorry, that tells me that you’re not really paying attention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;188&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has become a tradition for tech companies to release elaborate, self-referential jokes every April Fools’ Day. The point is to generate some free publicity that will make the company seem quirky and relatable, but it can also have the opposite effect, especially when the premise of the joke is Silicon Valley’s unprecedented power. A few years ago, Twitter announced that it would start charging for vowels. Last year, Google shared a mockup of its new data center on Mars, and Amazon revealed voice-recognition software that would take commands from pets. The companies hadn’t actually initiated any of these projects, but they probably could, one day, if they wanted to. Get it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last April Fools’, instead of a parody announcement, Reddit unveiled a genuine social experiment. It was called r/Place, and it was a blank square, a thousand pixels by a thousand pixels. In the beginning, all million pixels were white. Once the experiment started, anyone could change a single pixel, anywhere on the grid, to one of sixteen colors. The only restriction was speed: the algorithm allowed each redditor to alter just one pixel every five minutes. “That way, no one person can take over—it’s too slow,” Josh Wardle, the Reddit product manager in charge of Place, explained. “In order to do anything at scale, they’re gonna have to coöperate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Place had been active for about twenty minutes when I stopped by, and Wardle was huddled over his laptop, frantically refreshing dozens of tabs. So far, the square was mostly blank, with a few stray dots blinking in and out of existence. But redditors were making plans in the comments and, in true Reddit fashion, clinging to those plans with cultish intensity. The Blue Empire was conspiring to turn the whole square blue; the Red Empire vowed to make it red; already, they were on a war footing. Other groups planned elaborate messages, fractal patterns, and references to various memes. A multi-partisan group—leftists, Trump supporters, patriotic libertarians, and pre-political teen-agers—decided to draw an American flag in the center of the square. They congregated at r/AmericanFlagInPlace, where they hashed out the exact dimensions, the shapes of the stars and stripes, and strategies for repelling invaders. Meanwhile, a group of nihilists at r/BlackVoid prepared to blot out whatever the other groups created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wardle went to great lengths to show me that Place was a pure democracy—the algorithm was designed so that, once it went live, all he could do was watch, along with everyone else. Now that he was watching, he seemed deeply nervous. “The idea was ‘Let’s put up a very simple microcosm of the Internet and just see what happens,’ ” he said. “Reddit itself is not the most complex idea. It’s sort of a blank canvas. The community takes that and does all sorts of creative things with it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And some terrible things,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;CneEmbed__cneEmbed___s8Ijz&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;CneEmbed__embedCaption___9Ig9I&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO&quot;&gt;The idea behind r/Place was to put up a very simple microcosm of the Internet and see what happens.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He paused. “I’m pretty confident,” he said. “I’d be lying if I said I was a hundred per cent confident.” Already, one of the top comments on Place read, “I give this an hour until swastikas.” Later, one of Wardle’s colleagues told me, “That was what kept Josh up at night. Before this went live, he was literally calculating, ‘O.K., it takes a minimum of seventeen pixels to make a swastika—what if we open this up to the world, and the headline the next day is “&lt;em class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Reddit: A Place to Draw Swastikas on the Internet&lt;/em&gt;”?’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upper-left corner was a choppy, flickering purple, as the Blue Empire and the Red Empire battled for dominance. A graffiti artist, or artists, wrote, “9/11 was an inside job”; a few minutes later, the “was” turned into “wasn’t,” and the “an” became “anime.” Elsewhere, “Dick butt” became “Dick butter,” then “Dick buffet.” And then the swastikas appeared—just a few of them, but enough to make Wardle raise the hood of his sweatshirt, retreat into an empty conference room, and shut the door, looking pallid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his office, Huffman met with Chris Slowe, Reddit’s first employee, who is now the chief technical officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How is Place going?” Huffman asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pretty much as expected,” Slowe said. “A lot of memes, some Pokémon, and a barrage of dicks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If there’s ever a Reddit musical, that wouldn’t be a bad title,” Huffman said. “Maybe I should write a memoir called ‘A Barrage of Dicks.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have faith in our people,” Slowe said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunch was served: a shrimp-and-lentil salad and a vegan bean fricassee. People stood in the common area, holding paper plates, watching a live feed of Place on a wall-mounted TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One employee, reading the comments, said, “A bunch of people are finding swastikas and then telling everyone else where they are, so that people can go get rid of them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just saw it!” another said. He pointed to a section of the screen. As we watched, one swastika was erased and another was modified to become a Windows 95 logo. Eventually, the swastika-makers got bored and moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, the American flag caught on fire; the fire was stamped out, and the Reddit employees cheered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Feels like watching a football game in extreme slow motion,” one said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Or like watching the election results.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, God, don’t say that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toward the end, the square was a dense, colorful tapestry, chaotic and strangely captivating. It was a collage of hundreds of incongruous images: logos of colleges, sports teams, bands, and video-game companies; a transcribed monologue from “Star Wars”; likenesses of He-Man, David Bowie, the “Mona Lisa,” and a former Prime Minister of Finland. In the final hours, shortly before the experiment ended and the image was frozen for posterity, BlackVoid launched a surprise attack on the American flag. A dark fissure tore at the bottom of the flag, then overtook the whole thing. For a few minutes, the center was engulfed in darkness. Then a broad coalition rallied to beat back the Void; the stars and stripes regained their form, and, in the end, the flag was still there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final image contained no visible hate symbols, no violent threats, not even much nudity. Late in the day, Wardle emerged from hiding, poured himself a drink, and pushed back his hood. “It’s possible that I will be able to sleep tonight,” he said. ♦&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Rust&amp;#039;s 2018 roadmap</title>
<link>https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/03/12/roadmap.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/03/12/roadmap.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Each year the Rust community &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1728&quot;&gt;comes together&lt;/a&gt; to set out a roadmap. This year, in addition to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/09/05/Rust-2017-Survey-Results.html&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;, we put out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/01/03/new-years-rust-a-call-for-community-blogposts.html&quot;&gt;call for blog posts&lt;/a&gt; in December, which resulted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://readrust.net/rust-2018/&quot;&gt;100 blog posts&lt;/a&gt; written over the span of a few weeks. The end result is the recently-merged &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2314&quot;&gt;2018 roadmap RFC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;rust-2018-edition&quot;&gt;Rust: 2018 edition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This year, we will deliver &lt;em&gt;Rust 2018&lt;/em&gt;, marking the first major new edition of Rust since 1.0&lt;/strong&gt; (aka Rust 2015).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will continue to publish releases every six weeks as usual. But we will designate a release in the latter third of the year (Rust 1.29 - 1.31) as &lt;em&gt;Rust 2018&lt;/em&gt;. This new “edition” of Rust will be the culmination of feature stabilization throughout the year, and will ship with polished documentation, tooling, and libraries that tie in to those features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of editions is to signify major steps in Rust’s evolution, where a collection of new features or idioms, taken as a whole, changes the experience of using Rust. They’re a chance, every few years, to take stock of the work we’ve delivered in six-week increments. To tell a bigger story about where Rust is going. And to ship the whole stack as a polished product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect that each edition will have a core theme or focus. Thinking of 1.0 as “Rust 2015”, we have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-will-be-in-rust-2018&quot;&gt;What will be in Rust 2018?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roadmap doesn’t say &lt;em&gt;for certain&lt;/em&gt; what will ship in Rust 2018, but we have a pretty good idea, and we’ll cover the major suspects below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;documentation-improvements&quot;&gt;Documentation improvements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the goal with the Rust 2018 release is to provide high quality documentation for the full set of new and improved features and the idioms they give rise to. &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/second-edition/&quot;&gt;The Rust Programming Language book&lt;/a&gt; has been completely re-written over the last 18 months, and will be updated throughout the year as features reach the stable compiler. &lt;a href=&quot;https://rustbyexample.com/&quot;&gt;Rust By Example&lt;/a&gt; will likewise undergo a revamp this year. And there are numerous third party books, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920040385.do&quot;&gt;Programming Rust&lt;/a&gt;, reaching print as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;language-improvements&quot;&gt;Language improvements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most prominent language work in the pipeline stems from &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/03/02/lang-ergonomics.html&quot;&gt;2017’s ergonomics initiative&lt;/a&gt;. Almost all of the accepted RFCs from the initiative are available on nightly today, and will be polished and stabilized over the next several months. Among these productivity improvements are a few “headliners” that will form the backbone of the release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ownership system improvements&lt;/strong&gt;, including making borrowing more flexible via “non-lexical lifetimes”, improved pattern matching integration, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trait system improvements&lt;/strong&gt;, including the long-awaited &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;impl Trait&lt;/code&gt; syntax for dealing with types abstractly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Module system improvements&lt;/strong&gt;, focused on increasing clarity and reducing complexity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generators/async/await:&lt;/strong&gt; work is rapidly progressing on first-class async programming support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, we anticipate a few more major features to stabilize prior to the Rust 2018 release, including &lt;strong&gt;SIMD&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;custom allocators&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;macros 2.0&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;compiler-improvements&quot;&gt;Compiler improvements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/02/15/Rust-1.24.html&quot;&gt;Rust 1.24&lt;/a&gt;, incremental recompilation is available and enabled by default on the stable compiler. This feature already makes rebuilds significantly faster than fresh builds, but over the course of the year we expect continued improvements for &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; fresh and re-builds. Compiler performance should not be an obstacle to productivity in Rust 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;tooling-improvements&quot;&gt;Tooling improvements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust 2018 will see high quality 1.0 releases of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rls&quot;&gt;Rust Language Server&lt;/a&gt; (“RLS”, which underlies much of our IDE integration story) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustfmt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (a standard formatting tool for Rust code). We will continue to improve Cargo by stabilizing custom registries, public dependencies, and a revised profile system. We’re also expecting further work on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2136&quot;&gt;Cargo build system integration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/4959&quot;&gt;Xargo integration&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2318&quot;&gt;custom test frameworks&lt;/a&gt;, though it’s unclear as yet how many of these will be complete prior to Rust 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;library-improvements&quot;&gt;Library improvements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/05/05/libz-blitz.html&quot;&gt;our work from last year&lt;/a&gt;, we will publish a 1.0 version of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/api-guidelines&quot;&gt;Rust API guidelines book&lt;/a&gt;, continue pushing important libraries to 1.0 status, improve discoverability through a revamped cookbook effort, and make heavy investments in libraries in specific domains—as we’ll see below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;web-site-improvements&quot;&gt;Web site improvements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of Rust 2018, we will completely overhaul the Rust web site, making it useful for CTOs and engineers alike. It should be far easier to find information to help evaluate Rust for your use case, and to stay up to date with the latest tooling and ecosystem improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;four-target-domains&quot;&gt;Four target domains&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of our goal with Rust 2018 is to demonstrate Rust’s productivity in specific domains of use. We’ve selected four such domains to invest in and highlight this year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network services&lt;/strong&gt;. Rust’s reliability and low footprint make it an excellent match for network services and infrastructure, especially at high scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/announcing-the-cli-working-group/6872&quot;&gt;Command-line apps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (CLI). Rust’s portability, reliability, ergonomics, and ability to produce static binaries come together to great effect for writing CLI apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/come-join-the-rust-and-webassembly-working-group/6845&quot;&gt;WebAssembly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The “wasm” web standard allows shipping native-like binaries to all major browsers, but GC support is still years away. Rust is &lt;a href=&quot;https://mgattozzi.com/rust-wasm&quot;&gt;extremely well positioned&lt;/a&gt; to target this domain, and provides a reasonable on-ramp for programmers coming from JS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/announcing-the-embedded-devices-working-group/6839&quot;&gt;Embedded devices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Rust has the potential to make programming resource-constrained devices much more productive—and fun! We want embedded programming to reach first-class status this year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these domains has a dedicated working group for the year. These WGs will work in a cross-cutting fashion, interfacing with language, tooling, library, and documentation work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;compatibility-across-editions&quot;&gt;Compatibility across editions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: Rust will continue its stability guarantee of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2014/10/30/Stability.html&quot;&gt;hassle-free updates to new versions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Editions will have a meaning for the compiler. You will be able to write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-toml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;edition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;2018&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in your Cargo.toml to &lt;em&gt;opt in&lt;/em&gt; to the new edition for your crate. Doing so may introduce new keywords or otherwise require adjustments to code. However:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can use &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; editions indefinitely on &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; compilers; &lt;strong&gt;editions are opt-in&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Editions are set on a &lt;em&gt;per-crate&lt;/em&gt; basis and can be mixed and matched; &lt;strong&gt;you can be on a different edition from your dependencies&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warning-free code in one edition must compile, and have the same behavior, on the next.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edition-related warnings, e.g. that an identifier will become a keyword in the next edition, must be easily fixable via an automated migration tool (rustfix). &lt;strong&gt;Only a small minority of crates should require &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; manual work to opt in to a new edition&lt;/strong&gt;, and that manual work must be minimal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the progression of new compiler versions is independent from editions; you can migrate at your leisure, and don’t have to worry about ecosystem compatibility; and edition migration is normally trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;additional-2018-goals&quot;&gt;Additional 2018 goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Rust 2018 release is our major focus this year, there are some additional ongoing concerns that we want to give attention to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;better-serving-intermediate-rustaceans&quot;&gt;Better serving intermediate Rustaceans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the strongest messages we’ve heard from production users, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/09/05/Rust-2017-Survey-Results.html&quot;&gt;the 2017 survey&lt;/a&gt;, is that people need more resources to take them from understanding Rust’s concepts to knowing how to use them &lt;em&gt;effectively&lt;/em&gt;. The roadmap does not stipulate exactly what these resources should look like — &lt;a href=&quot;https://quietmisdreavus.net/code/2018/01/10/not-a-layer-cake-analogy/&quot;&gt;probably there should be several kinds&lt;/a&gt; — but commits us as a community to putting significant work into this space, and ending the year with some solid new material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connect and empower Rust’s global community&lt;/strong&gt;. We will pursue internationalization as a first-class concern, and proactively work to build ties between Rust subcommunities currently separated by language, geography, or culture. We will spin up and support Rust events worldwide, including further growth of the RustBridge program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grow Rust’s teams and new leaders within them&lt;/strong&gt;. We will refactor the Rust team structure to support more scale, agility, and leadership growth. We will systematically invest in mentoring, both by creating more on-ramp resources and through direct mentorship relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-call-to-action&quot;&gt;A call to action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always in the Rust world, the goals laid out here will ultimately be the result of a community-wide effort—maybe one including you! Here are some of the teams where we could use the most help. Note that all IRC channels refer to the irc.mozilla.org network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WebAssembly WG&lt;/strong&gt;. Compiling Rust to WebAssembly should be &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; best choice for fast code on the Web. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-wasm&quot;&gt;rust-lang-nursery/rust-wasm&lt;/a&gt; to learn more and get involved!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLI WG&lt;/strong&gt;. Writing CLI apps in Rust should be a frictionless experience–from finding the right libraries and writing concise integration tests up to cross-platform distribution. Join us at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/cli-wg&quot;&gt;rust-lang-nursery/cli-wg&lt;/a&gt; and help us reach that goal!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embedded Devices WG&lt;/strong&gt;. Quality, productivity, accessibility: Rust can change the embedded industry for the better. Let’s get this process started in 2018! Join us at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/embedded-wg&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/embedded-wg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ecosystem WG&lt;/strong&gt;. We’ll be providing guidance and support to important crates throughout the ecosystem. Drop into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitter.im/rust-lang/WG-ecosystem&quot;&gt;WG-ecosystem room&lt;/a&gt; and we’ll guide you to places that need help!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dev Tools Team&lt;/strong&gt;. There are always interesting things to tackle with developer tools (IDEs, Cargo, rustdoc, Clippy, Rustfmt, custom test frameworks, and more). Drop in to #rust-dev-tools and have a chat with the team!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rustdoc Team&lt;/strong&gt;. With your help, we can make documentation better for everyone. Come join us in #rustdoc on IRC, and we can help you get started!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Release Team&lt;/strong&gt;. Drop by #rust-release on IRC to get involved with regression triage and release production!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community Team&lt;/strong&gt;. We’ve kicked off several new Teams within the Community Team and are eager to add new members: Events, Content, Switchboard, RustBridge, Survey, and Localization! &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-community/team&quot;&gt;Check out our team repo&lt;/a&gt; or stop by our IRC channel, #rust-community, to learn more and get involved!&lt;/li&gt;

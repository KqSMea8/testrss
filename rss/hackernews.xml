<title>EU copyright reform: the facts</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2018/09/07/eu-copyright-reform-the-facts/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2018/09/07/eu-copyright-reform-the-facts/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday 12 September, Members of the European Parliament will hold a crucial vote on new copyright rules that could fundamentally damage the internet in Europe. If adopted, the new rules will force online services to universally monitor and filter the content that users post online. Ahead of the vote, we wish to set the facts straight and explain exactly what these new rules will mean for openness and decentralisation in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FACT: The proposed new copyright rules will harm Europe’s open source community.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mandatory upload filters and copyright licensing provisions in article 13 of the proposed law are unworkable for open source software firms like Mozilla and the open source ecosystem generally. The obligations cover &lt;em&gt;all forms&lt;/em&gt; of copyright-protected content, including software. Indeed, the cost and legal risk associated with these new rules would push smaller open source software developers out of Europe and threaten the code-sharing platforms (e.g. GitHub) on which they depend to innovate. The fluid nature of technology and software development means that any carve-outs — say for software development platforms — would still risk creating a risk-laden environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FACT: The proposed new copyright rules will negatively affect everyday user’s internet experiences.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When internet users want to share a witty meme online, or a home movie in which background music is audible, or even a photo of themselves wearing a t-shirt with an album cover printed on it, they may well find that their favourite online service blocks the content upload. Internet services of all sizes will be forced to implement automatic filtering technology,  likely suppressing anything that looks like it might be infringing copyright, irrespective of whether the user has a right or permission to use the content. Given the crucial role the internet plays in citizens’ everyday lives, the impact on creativity, communication, and free expression from such blanket filtering would be palpable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FACT: The proposed new copyright rules will lead to direct surveillance of users’ activities online.​&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article 13 demands that online services build or buy specific technology to monitor and categorise each and every user upload. At a time when the EU is showing global leadership on privacy and data protection, it is deeply regrettable that lawmakers are nonetheless seeking to codify a regime that would compel service providers to monitor European internet users’ activity with even more vigour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FACT: The proposed new copyright rules will negatively impact independent creators.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article 13 will be used to restrict the freedom of expression and creative potential of independent artists who depend upon online services to directly reach their audience and bypass the rigidities and limitations of the commercial content industry. Sadly, the fight over this legislation has been construed as giant rightsholders versus giant online platforms. But in reality, the true victims will be creators and fans themselves. There’s a bitter irony at play: the directors, actors, songwriters, and artists who benefit from the viral sharing of their creations are now pitted against their fans, who in fact do some of the most efficient online marketing artists can hope for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FACT: Smaller online services – and not giant platforms – will be hit hardest by the new rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to its impact on user experience, this law will have another, more insidious impact: it will further entrench the power of the biggest online platforms. Only a handful of the largest tech companies have the technical and financial means to operate the sprawling filtering systems that this law demands. Ironically, the companies at which this law is aimed are already filtering content — and so will have a competitive advantage vis-a-vis their smaller rivals and startups, who will need to invest heavily to comply with the law. In addition, the biggest platforms also have the resources and clout to mount legal defences when larger corporate rightsholders seek to suppress legal content. This is not an option for smaller players who will face a high-stakes game of legal risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We encourage anyone who shares these concerns to reach out to members of the European Parliament – you can call them directly via &lt;a href=&quot;https://changecopyright.org/en-US/&quot;&gt;changecopyright.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Firefox about:config privacy settings</title>
<link>https://gist.github.com/0XDE57/fbd302cef7693e62c769</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://gist.github.com/0XDE57/fbd302cef7693e62c769</guid>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;about:config settings to harden the Firefox browser. Privacy and performance enhancements.&lt;br/&gt;To change these settings type 'about:config' in the url bar. Then search the setting you would like to change and modify the value. Some settings may break certain websites from functioning and rendering normally. Some settings may also make firefox unstable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I am not liable for any damages/loss of data.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all these changes are necessary and will be dependent upon your usage and hardware. Do some research on settings if you don't understand what they do. These settings are best combined with your standard privacy extensions (HTTPS Everywhere, NoScript/Request Policy, uBlock origin, agent spoofing, Privacy Badger etc), and all plugins set to &quot;Ask To Activate&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: some keys may not be listed and must be added manually, or they are no longer relavent as firefox changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: you can check current connections via: about:networking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;dom.event.contextmenu.enabled = false

        or otherwise messing with the context menu.

dom.event.clipboardevents.enabled = false
        Don't allow websites to prevent copy and paste.
        Disable notifications of copy, paste, or cut functions. 
        Stop webpage knowing which part of the page had been selected.

network.IDN_show_punycode = true
        Show punycode. Help protect from character 'spoofing' eg:
        xn--80ak6aa92e.com -&amp;gt; аррӏе.com
        [IDN homograph attacks](https://www.xudongz.com/blog/2017/idn-phishing/)

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

        1 = Send only on clicked links.
        2 = (default) Send for links and image.
        
network.http.sendSecureXSiteReferrer = false
        Disable referrer headers between https websites.
                
network.http.referer.spoofSource = true
        Send fake referrer (if choose to send referrers).

        Security risk, but privacy improvement.
        Note: this list may be incomplete as firefox updates, be sure to search for browser.safebrowsing.provider.google*
        Also simply setting safebrowsing.*.enabled to false should make setting the URL's to blank redundant, but better to be safe.
        If you see anything pointing google, probably best to nuke it.

        2 = No cookies are allowed. 
        3 = Third-party cookies are allowed only if that site has stored cookies already from a previous visit 
                        
network.cookie.lifetimePolicy 
        cookies are deleted at the end of the session
        0 = The cookie's lifetime is supplied by the server. (Default) 
        1 = The user is prompted for the cookie's lifetime. 
        2 = The cookie expires at the end of the session (when the browser closes). 
        3 = The cookie lasts for the number of days specified by network.cookie.lifetime.days.   

network.dnsCacheEntries = 100
        Number of cached DNS entries. Lower number = More requests but less data stored.

network.predictor.enabled = false
network.dns.disablePrefetch = true   
network.prefetch-next = false
        Link prefetching is when a webpage hints to the browser that certain pages are likely to be visited, 
        so the browser downloads them immediately so they can be displayed immediately when the user requests it.

layers.async-video.enabled = true
html5.offmainthread = true
        Enable Hardware Acceleration and Off Main Thread Compositing (OMTC).
        It's likely your browser is already set to use these features.
        May introduce instability on some hardware.

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;browser.cache.memory.capacity = xx
        Limit memory cache size. (xx = value in MB)

        Reduce memory usage when minimized. (Windows only)
        
image.mem.max_decoded_image_kb = xx
        How much info Firefox stores of uncompressed images.
        Higher value = improve speed at the expense of increased memory usage.
        
javascript.options.mem.max == xx
        Limit amount of memory javascript may consume.
        -1 = Automatic

javascript.options.mem.high_water_mark == xx
        Tell garbage collector to start running when javascript is using xx MB of memory. 
        Garbage collection releases memory back to the system.
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is not for firefox, but for Flash if you have it installed. Font Enumeration allows a site to read which fonts you have installed which can be used to identify users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Default Location:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Windows: 
        C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Macromed\Flash\mms.cfg
        C:\Windows\system32\Macromed\Flash\mms.cfg
Linux:
        /etc/adobe/mms.cfg
OSX:
        ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Pepper Data/Shockwave Flash/System/mms.cfg
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add this line to the mms.cfg file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;DisableDeviceFontEnumeration = 1
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better yet, simply uninstall flash. Flash is garbage...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;___&lt;br/&gt;**I do my best to keep this list up to date. Additions and corrections are greatly appreciated.**</description>

<title>Keybase’s browser extension subverts its encryption</title>
<link>https://palant.de/2018/09/06/keybase-our-browser-extension-subverts-our-encryption-but-why-should-we-care</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://palant.de/2018/09/06/keybase-our-browser-extension-subverts-our-encryption-but-why-should-we-care</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Two days ago I decided to take a look at Keybase. Keybase does crypto, is open source and offers security bug bounties for relevant findings — just the perfect investigation subject for me. It didn’t take long for me to realize that their browser extension is deeply flawed, so I reported the issue to them via their bug bounty program. The response was rather… remarkable. It can be summed up as: “Yes, we know. But why should we care?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What is Keybase?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The self-description of Keybase emphasizes its secure end-to-end encryption (emphasis in original):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a &lt;strong&gt;Slack&lt;/strong&gt; for the whole world, except &lt;strong&gt;end-to-end encrypted&lt;/strong&gt; across all your devices. Or a &lt;strong&gt;Team Dropbox&lt;/strong&gt; where the server can’t leak your files or be hacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the app allows you to exchange messages or files with other people, with the encryption happening on sender’s computer in such a way that decryption is only possible by the designated recipient. This app is available for both desktop and mobile platforms. And for desktop you get a bonus: you can install the Keybase browser extension. It will add a “Keybase Chat” button to people’s profiles on Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, Reddit or Hacker News. This button allows you to connect to people easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://palant.de/images/12.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;417&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clicking the button will open a chat window and allow you to enter a message directly in the browser. Only after that initial message is sent the conversation will be transferred to the Keybase app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;So what’s the issue?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue here is a very common one, merely a week ago I listed it as #6 in &lt;a href=&quot;https://palant.de/2018/08/29/password-managers-please-make-sure-autofill-is-secure&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;. The extension injects its user interface (the button and the chat window) into third-party websites, yet it fails to isolate it from these websites. So the first consequence is: the Keybase message you enter on Facebook is by no means private. Facebook’s JavaScript code can read it out as you type it in, so much for end-to-end encryption. This is quite contrary to the promise Keybase still makes on their Mozilla Add-ons and Chrome Web Store installation pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://palant.de/images/13.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;428&quot; height=&quot;333&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t believe that Facebook would intentionally spy on you? Maybe not, but by now it is pretty common to protocol all of user’s actions, for “site optimization” purposes — this includes anything entered into text fields of course. But in my opinion, that’s not even the worst issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A website could do more than passively spying on you. It could just as well instrument the Keybase user interface in order to send messages in your name, while also making this user interface invisible so that you don’t notice anything. Why would Facebook want to do something like that? Not necessary them, rather anybody who discovered a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting&quot;&gt;Cross-Site Scripting (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;XSS&lt;/span&gt;) vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; in one of the websites that Keybase integrates with. So if hundreds of people complain about you sending them spam messages via Keybase, it might be somebody exploiting the Keybase extension on your computer via an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;XSS&lt;/span&gt; vulnerability in Reddit. Have fun explaining how you didn’t do it, even though the messages were safely encrypted on your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What does Keybase think about this?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Keybase, “this is all clearly described on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://keybase.io/docs/extension&quot;&gt;install page&lt;/a&gt; and is known.” In fact, close to the bottom of that page you find the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if my browser is compromised?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Keybase extension uses a compose box inside your browser. If you fear your browser or the social network site’s JavaScript has been compromised — say by another extension or even the social network acting fishy — then just compose the message inside the Keybase app directly. Or send a quick hello note through the extension and save the jucier private details for inside the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, this is thoroughly confusing. First of all, “browser is compromised” to me sounds more like malware. Trouble is, malware affecting the browser will affect the Keybase app just as well, so the advise makes no sense. But let’s say that it really is “the social network acting fishy,” how are you supposed to know? And is Facebook spying on you “fishy” or just its usual self?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not that this issue is unavoidable. Avoiding it is fairly easy, by isolating all of the extension’s user interface in an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element. This would prevent both the website and other extensions from accessing it. Disaster averted, nothing to see here. But according to Keybase:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there were technical reasons why iframes didn’t work, though I forget the details&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I translate this as: “Using iframes required a slightly more complicated approach, so we couldn’t figure it out.” Also:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s such a minor feature for us, it’s not worth a fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I translate this as: “We will keep pushing this extension because it gets users to promote our app for free. But we don’t care enough to make it secure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;And now?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only advise I can give you: uninstall the Keybase browser extension &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ASAP&lt;/span&gt;. As to the app itself, it &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be secure. But as &lt;a href=&quot;https://palant.de/2018/07/11/ftapi-secutransfer-the-secure-alternative-to-emails-not-quite&quot;&gt;experience shows&lt;/a&gt;, the claim “end-to-end encryption” doesn’t automatically translate into a secure implementation. Initially, I planned to take a closer look at the crypto in Keybase, to see whether I can find weaknesses in their implementation. But that’s off the table now.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Keybase: &quot;Our browser extension subverts our encryption, but why should we care?&quot;</og:title>
<og:description>The Keybase browser extension subverts the app's end-to-end encryption. Keybase considers that &quot;an acceptable risk&quot; and not worth fixing.</og:description>

<title>Huawei caught cheating performance test for new phones</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/huawei-caught-cheating-performance-test-for-new-phones/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/huawei-caught-cheating-performance-test-for-new-phones/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;UL, the company behind the tablet and phone performance benchmark app 3DMark, has delisted new Huawei phones from its “Best Smartphone” leaderboard after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anandtech.com/show/13318/huawei-benchmark-cheating-headache&quot;&gt;AnandTech&lt;/a&gt; discovered the phone maker was boosting its performance to ace the app’s test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phones delisted were the P20, P20 Pro, Nova 3 and the Honor Play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After testing the devices in our own lab and confirming that they breach our rules, we have decided to delist the affected models and remove them from our performance rankings,” the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://benchmarks.ul.com/news/ul-delists-huawei-phones-with-suspect-benchmark-scores&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Huawei case, the rules are actually a little fuzzy. Phones are permitted to adjust performance based on workload, which results in peaks or dips in performance for different apps, but they are not permitted to hard-code peaks in performance specifically for the benchmark app. Huawei reportedly claimed that the peak in performance seen during the run of the benchmark app was an intuitive jump determined by AI; however, when an unlabeled version of the benchmark test was run, the phones were unable to recognize it and, as a result, displayed lower performances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the phones aren’t so smart after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei is not the first company caught overstepping these rules. Samsung &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/6/17828534/huawei-benchmarks-rigged-p20-3dmark-ai&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;did as well in 2013&lt;/a&gt;, and ironically the results of these benchmark tests actually mean little in terms of overall general performance of the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they can point to how a phone may perform during heavy stress, average performance is still best discovered through individual testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei did not immediately return a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: &lt;/strong&gt;In a comment late Thursday night, a Huawei spokesperson told TechCrunch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei always prioritizes the user experience rather than pursuing high benchmark scores – especially since there isn’t a direct connection between smartphone benchmarks and user experiences. Huawei smartphones use advanced technologies such as AI to optimize the performance of hardware, including the CPU, GPU and NPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In normal benchmarking scenarios, once Huawei’s software recognizes a benchmarking application, it intelligently adapts to “Performance Mode” and delivers optimum performance. Huawei is planning to provide users with access to “Performance Mode” so they can use the maximum power of their device when they need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei – as the industry leader – is willing to work with partners to find the best benchmarking standards that can accurately evaluate the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<title>Whole Foods workers seek to unionize</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/whole-foods-workers-seek-to-unionize-says-amazon-is-exploiting-our-dedication/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/whole-foods-workers-seek-to-unionize-says-amazon-is-exploiting-our-dedication/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A group of workers at Whole Foods Market is leading an effort to establish a union for the Amazon-owned company’s 85,000+ workforce.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://newfoodeconomy.org/whole-foods-workers-union-letter-amazon/&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; addressed to Whole Foods employees, the group — members of Whole Foods’ cross-regional committee — wrote that they are “concerned about the direction” of Whole Foods in an Amazon era. The letter outlines several demands, including a $15 minimum wage for all employees, 401k matching, paid maternity leave, lower health insurance deductibles and more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We cannot let Amazon remake the entire North American retail landscape without embracing the full value of its team members. The success of Amazon and [Whole Foods] should not come at the cost of exploiting our dedication and threatening our economic stability,” they wrote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The grocery store chain was acquired by Amazon one year ago in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/16/report-amazon-is-gobbling-whole-foods-for-a-reported-13-7-billion/&quot;&gt;$13.7 billion deal&lt;/a&gt; that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;sent shock waves through the e-commerce and brick-and-mortar retail industries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. In that 12-month period, the e-commerce giant has implemented changes to the grocery chain’s nearly 500 stores. Amazon Echos have become part of the inventory in some locations and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Amazon lockers have shown up to facilitate Amazon.com pick-ups and returns, for example.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The letter, which calls out both Jeff Bezos and Whole Foods’ CEO John Mackey directly, says there will “continue to be layoffs in 2019 and beyond as Amazon aims to aggressively trim our labor force before it expands with new technology and labor models.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since the Amazon acquisition, several hundred Whole Foods workers have been laid-off as Amazon infuses&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;“Whole Foods with its efficient, data-driven ethos,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-era-at-amazons-whole-foods-grates-on-some-suppliers-employees-1530526964&quot;&gt;per The Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;. Shoppers, however,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.wholefoodsmarket.com/news/just-one-year-since-joining-the-amazon-family-whole-foods-market-customers#When:04:01:00Z&quot;&gt;have saved millions&lt;/a&gt; as a result of the shake-up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a statement provided to TechCrunch, a representative of Whole Foods said they respect the “individual rights of [their] team members.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“[We] have an open-door policy that encourages team members to bring their comments, questions and concerns directly to their team leaders,” they &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;said. “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;We believe this direct connection is the most effective way to understand and respond to the needs of our workforce and creates an atmosphere that fosters open communication and empowerment. We offer competitive wages and benefits and are committed to the growth and success of our team members.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Amazon provided a virtually identical statement, adding that they encourage anyone concerned about employee treatment to take a tour of one of their fulfillment centers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the full letter, obtained by New Food Economy.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Introduction to Calculus with Derivatives</title>
<link>http://adit.io/posts/2018-02-18-Introduction-To-Calculus-With-Derivatives.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://adit.io/posts/2018-02-18-Introduction-To-Calculus-With-Derivatives.html</guid>
<description>&lt;time&gt;Written February 18, 2018&lt;/time&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/101_squared.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you need to calculate \(101^2\) but you don't have a calculator handy. How would you estimate it? \(100^2\) is pretty easy: \(100 * 100 = 10000\). But \(101^2\) seems tougher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/4_point_1_squared.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or suppose you had to estimate \(4.1^2\). How would you do it? What about \(7.1^2\)? In all these cases, you know the square of a number that is pretty close (\(100^2\), \(4^2\), \(7^2\)). Can you use that to estimate this more difficult value?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/thinking.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if I told you that \(4.1^2\) is \(16.81\). So that \(0.1\) change increased the square by \(0.81\) (from \(16\) to \(16.81\)). Does that mean \(7.1^2\) is \(49.81\) (because \(7^2\) is \(49\))? Or does it mean \(101^2\) is \(10008.1\) (\(100\) -&amp;gt; \(101\) is a change of \(1\), so just multiply the previous change of \(0.1\) by \(10\))?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives will help answer these questions. In this post, I'll first answer these questions using derivatives. Then I'll explain what a derivative is, and how to calculate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;estimating-squares&quot;&gt;Estimating squares&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\(4^2\) is \(16\), and \(4.1^2\) is \(16.81\). Adding that \(0.1\) to \(4\) increased the square by \(0.81\), i.e. an increase of ~\(8\) times (\(0.1 * 8 =~ 0.81\)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\(5^2\) is \(25\), and \(5.1^2\) is \(26.01\). Adding that \(0.1\) to \(5\) increased the square by \(1.01\), i.e. an increase of ~\(10\) (\(0.1 * 10 =~ 1.01\)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets look at some other increases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/increases.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At \(4.1\), the increase was around \(8\). At \(5.1\), the increase was ~10. At \(6.1\), the increase was ~\(12\). Do you see the pattern? At \(7.1\), the increase must be around 14! All these numbers are roughly double the number we are trying to square (\(4.1\) -&amp;gt; \(8\), \(5.1\) -&amp;gt; \(10\), \(6.1\) -&amp;gt; \(12\), \(7.1\) -&amp;gt; \(14\)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know \(7^2\) is 49, and now we guess that there's an increase of 14 happening here. So to calculate \(7.1^2\), we need to increase that \(0.1\) by \(14\)! So \(7.1^2\) must be \(7^2 + 0.1*14\), or around \(50.4\):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/calculating_7_point_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\(7.1^2\) is actually \(50.41\), so we were really close!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to the original question, what is \(101^2\)? Well, there was an increase of \(1\) (from \(100\) to \(101\)). We know that will get multiplied by ~\(202\) in the square (\(101 * 2\)). So \(101^2\) must be \(100^2 + 202\), or around \(10202\). It is actually \(10201\), so again we were really close!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These numbers seem to magically tell you how to calculate values like \(4.1^2\), \(7.1^2\), or \(101^2\):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/magic_ratios.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the big reveal: those numbers are &lt;strong&gt;the derivative at those points&lt;/strong&gt;. Let's make this a little more precise. We have been working with the square function \(f(x)\):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/square_function.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know the value of \(f(x)\) for different values of \(x\):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/table.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here \(x\) is the input, and \(f(x)\) is the output. This whole time we have been changing the input (from \(4\) to \(4.1\) for example) and trying to guess the new output (i.e. if \(4^2 = 16\), what is \(4.1^2\)?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The derivative of \(f(x)\) (written \(f'(x)\) -- note the apostrophe) is \(2x\). Here's the same table with a column for the derivative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/table_with_derivative.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last column has all the ratios we were just using! Notice the same pattern: the derivative at \(4\) is \(8\), at \(5\) it is \(10\) etc. Each time you just double the input to get the derivative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's do another example and estimate \(5.1^2\). I know that \(5^2 = 25\), and the derivative at \(5\) is \(10\):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/estimate_5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So our estimate is \(5.1^2 = 26\). The correct answer is \(26.01\), so we are again very close!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's recap some important things we learned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The derivative of the function \(f(x) = x^2\) is \(f'(x) = 2x\).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This means, if we want to know \(101^2\) and we know the square of a close-by number like \(100^2\), we can figure out the change in input (\(1\)), multiply it by the derivative (\(202\)), and get the change in output (\(202\)). Then we know that \(101^2\) is approximately \(100^2\) plus \(202\).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is the most important takeaway from this whole blog post:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/how_output_will_change.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you change the input, you can use the derivative to estimate how the output changes. Note: it is not an exact answer! It is merely a very good estimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-a-derivative-is&quot;&gt;What A Derivative Is&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To recap, given some input change, the derivative tells us how the output will change. When we changed x from \(4\) to \(4.1\), the derivative told us that the output would change by a factor of \(8\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;strong&gt;most important takeaway&lt;/strong&gt; I had mentioned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/how_output_will_change.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written another way, a derivative is the ratio of output change to input change:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/output_over_input.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At \(4\), the derivative is \(8\). That means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/derivative_at_4_ratio.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can rearrange this fraction to get this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/derivative_mult.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how we have been using the derivative all along: multiplying the input change by the derivative to get the output change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier we had guessed the pattern that the output changes by around \(8\) at \(4.1\), around \(10\) at \(5.1\), around \(12\) at \(6.1\) etc. This was just our intuition, let's dig a little deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did we know that the output changed by around \(8\) at \(4.1\)? We did this math intuitively, in our heads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/ratio_at_4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That looks suspiciously like a derivative!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/looks_like_a_derivative.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an input change of \(0.1\), the output change is \(0.81\). So the ratio is \(0.81/0.1\), or \(8.1\). We know the derivative at \(4\) is \(8\), and this is pretty close. It seems we basically calculated the derivative at \(4\)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, I've been using \(0.1\) as the input change because we were calculating \(4.1^2\) earlier. There's nothing special about \(0.1\) as the input change, it is just what I chose. You could choose other input changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/other_ratios_at_4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that using \(0.1\), \(0.2\) or \(0.3\) as the input change, the ratios are all pretty close to \(8\). In all of these cases, we are pretty close to calculating the derivative at \(4\)! But here's something interesting -- the smaller the change, the closer the ratio is to \(8\):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/smaller_ratios_at_4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will come back to this later on. For now, we will just say that since the ratio is getting closer and closer to \(8\) as we make the change smaller, the derivative at \(4\) is \(8\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was easy! By just calculating output change / input change, we figured out the derivative at \(4\) -- it's \(8\)! So if you ever need to figure out the derivative at a particular point, now you know how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's calculate the derivative at other numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/ratios_at_other_numbers.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the derivative at \(4\) is \(8\). At \(5\) it is \(10\), and at \(6\) it is \(12\). Remember earlier I had said the derivative of \(f(x) = x^2\) is \(f'(x) = 2x\)? This seems to match pretty well, doesn't it? To get the derivative at any number, you just double that number. Notice that even though the derivative is different at each number, the function stays the same: \(2x\):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/ratios.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, maybe we could have cleverly spotted this pattern ourselves. What about more complicated cases? For example, take the function \(f(x) = sqrt(x)\). What is its derivative?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/table_for_sqrt_x.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have calculated some values for the derivative manually, but it is a little tougher to figure out what the derivative function is here (spoiler: it is \(1/(2 * sqrt(x)\)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next section, I will show how to calculate the derivative function, so you can easily calculate the derivative at any point without having to go through the output change / input change calculation every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. While we are here, why not use this table to estimate the square root of \(26\)? I bet this would have been really hard to do without derivatives, but with derivatives it is easy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/sqrt_26.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the square root of \(26\) is approximately \(5.1\). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sqrt(26)&quot;&gt;Here's a more exact result from WolframAlpha&lt;/a&gt;. We were very close!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-calculate-the-derivative&quot;&gt;How To Calculate The Derivative&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calculating the derivative isn't too different from what we did when we plugged in numbers. We used output change / input change to calculate the derivative at \(4\):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/output_change_only.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could write the ratio slightly differently like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/new_and_old_output.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't too different, we can figure out that the output change is the difference between the old and new input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this time, instead of plugging in numbers, we will plug in variables and do some algebra! Suppose the input change we are making is \(c\). What is the old output? What is the new output?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/new_and_old_output_example.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting it all together:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/generic_derivative.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formula is the same, we're just using variables instead of numbers. Now we know that \(f(x) = x^2\), which means \(f(x + c) = (x + c)^2\). Lets make that substitution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/generic01_substitute.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can expand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/generic02_expand.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And simplify:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/generic03_simplify.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we're left with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/2x_plus_c.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which looks a LOT like what we KNOW is the derivative: \(2x\)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By doing the same output change / input change but with variables instead of numbers, we seem to have gotten close to figuring out the derivative function, not just calculating the derivative at a particular point!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are almost there, there's one last wrinkle to talk about: limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;limits&quot;&gt;Limits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember when we were calculating the derivative at \(4\)? I had told you the derivative at 4 is 8. When we calculated it manually, it seemed like as we made the input change smaller, the value got closer and closer to \(8\):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/smaller_ratios_at_4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like the value would be \(8\) if we could just make the input change small enough! This is an important part of figuring out the derivative: you need to ask yourself &quot;what is the value approaching when I make the change smaller?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets look again at what we calculated using algebra. What happens if you keep making the input change smaller?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/c_disappears.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, the \(c\) just keeps getting smaller and smaller! We can also see this if we plug in the numbers into \(2x + c\):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/smaller_changes.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output looks a lot like our manual calculations! That change \(c\) never truly goes away, but it is so small that it doesn't really matter: if you make \(c\) small enough, the derivative is &lt;em&gt;basically&lt;/em&gt; \(8\). So we're just going to pretend that all the \(c\)s are so small they have become zero. Which leaves us with this as the derivative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/2x.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you feel a little dissatisfied? It doesn't feel very precise, does it? When we started out estimating \(7.1^2\), that's why it was an estimate. Derivatives won't give you an exact answer, just an estimate. The good news is, you can get an estimate that is as precise as you like. We used the derivative at \(7\) to estimate \(7.1\), which gave us a pretty good estimate. We could have used the derivative at \(4\) instead, to get a worse estimate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/poor_estimate_7.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the smaller the change, the more precise the result. Since \(4 -&amp;gt; 7.1\) is a bigger change than \(7 -&amp;gt; 7.1\), the result is less precise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all I will say about limits, but you can learn more by taking this &lt;a href=&quot;https://coursera.org/learn/calculus1/home/welcome&quot;&gt;excellent Calculus course&lt;/a&gt; by Jim Fowler!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we're ready for &lt;strong&gt;the official definition of derivative&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/definition_of_derivative.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said earlier, the derivative is the output change over the input change! That \(lim\) bit is read as &quot;the limit as \(c\) goes to zero&quot; and is the mathematical way of writing exactly what we just discussed: what's the derivative if you make the change small enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can calculate any derivative using this definition, just like we did for \(f(x) = x^2\). But there are also shortcuts for calculating the derivative! I'll get to those later on in the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;interlude:-how-to-visualize-the-derivative&quot;&gt;Interlude: How To Visualize The Derivative&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is a neat way to visualize the derivative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's one way to visualize \(f(x) = x^2\): picture a square with sides length \(x\). It's area is then \(x^2\):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/box.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I increase the length of a side, how does the area change? For example, if I go from sides length \(4\) to \(4.1\):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/bigger_box.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the area change? \(c\) represents the change, which is 0.1 in this case. We took the old square and added on some pieces:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/added_pieces.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those yellow pieces are the output change. You can see there are two rectangles of area \(c * x\), and one square of area \(c^2\). So the additional area is \(2cx + c^2\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now remember that the derivative is actually the ratio of output change to input change:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/output_over_input.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which in this case would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/derivative_of_box.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can simplify this fraction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/simplify.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And based on our conversation about limits, we can throw away the \(c\). So the derivative is \(2x\)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;faq&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;as-we-moved-from-4-to-5,-the-derivative-changed-from-8-to-10.-what-does-that-mean?&quot;&gt;As we moved from 4 to 5, the derivative changed from 8 to 10. What does that mean?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose we have two squares, one with side length \(4\) and the other with side length \(10\):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/4_and_10_squares.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now suppose you increase the side length by \(0.1\) for both boxes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/increase_size.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that the total area increased by MORE for the \(10\) box than the \(4\) box:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/more_than_this_yellow_stuff.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I increased the length of the box side by the same amount. But the area grew by different amounts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/yellow_increases.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area of the size \(10\) box increased by more than the area of the size \(4\) box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For bigger boxes, the input change leads to a bigger output change. Back to the table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/table_with_derivative.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output changes by a factor of \(8\) if the box is a size \(4\), but it changes by a factor of \(14\) if the box is a size \(7\). For a box of size \(10\), the output changes by a factor of \(20\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-we-estimated-5.1^2,-why-did-we-use-the-derivative-at-5-instead-of-the-derivative-at-4?&quot;&gt;When we estimated 5.1^2, why did we use the derivative at 5 instead of the derivative at 4?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose I want to use \(4^2\) to calculate \(5^2\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/poor_estimate_5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is off by one, not great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or suppose I want to use \(4^2\) to calculate \(100^2\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/poor_estimate_100.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\(100^2\) is actually \(10000\), so that is off by a LOT! That makes sense, because although \(f'(4) = 8\), \(f'(100) = 200\). The ratios are wildly different so the estimate is not as good. The closer your derivative is to the number, the better your estimate will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we used \(200\) as the ratio instead? \(4^2 + (96*200) = 16 + 19200 = 19216\). So we know the answer is somewhere between \(784\) and \(19216\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember: The smaller the change, the more accurate your estimate will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;power-rule,-chain-rule&quot;&gt;Power rule, chain rule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point you know what the derivative is, and how to find it. But calculating the derivative using the definition can get tedious! I'll end the post by showing some shortcuts for finding the derivative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;power-rule&quot;&gt;Power rule&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power rule is a simple way to calculate derivatives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/power_rule.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/power_rule_examples.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the derivative of \(x^2\) is \(2x\), as we knew it would be. The other derivatives are interesting and would have taken more work to calculate without the power rule!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power rule also works when there are multiple terms being added or subtracted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/power_rule_multiple_terms_01.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/power_rule_multiple_terms_02.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, if you have multiple terms being added or subtracted, you can apply all the rules here (power rule, product rule etc) to individual terms. To quote Jim Fowler's &lt;a href=&quot;http://coursera.org/learn/calculus1&quot;&gt;excellent Coursera course&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also always calculate these using the definition of the derivative, though that takes more work. Here's an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/power_rule_the_long_way.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;product-rule&quot;&gt;Product rule&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would you find the derivative of something like this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/complicated_product.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the product rule:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/product_rule.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/product_rule_example.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how you could find the derivative of \(x^2\) using the product rule:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/product_rule_x_squared.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;quotient-rule&quot;&gt;Quotient rule&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if something is being divided? Use the quotient rule:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/quotient_rule.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/quotient_rule_example.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;chain-rule&quot;&gt;Chain rule&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you have two functions that are nested? Use the chain rule!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/chain_rule.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is really handy when you come across something complicated like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/complex_example.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a complicated thing to differentiate, but we can break it apart into two functions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/split_into_two_functions.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One function is just the square root, the other function is that complicated thing inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the derivatives of those two functions separately:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/chain_rule_derivatives.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then use the chain rule. To calculate \(g'(f(x))\), we take the derivative of \(g(x)\), and everywhere you see \(x\), substitute \(f(x)\) (i.e. \(x^3 + 2x + 5\)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/use_the_chain_rule.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you need help you can always ask &lt;a href=&quot;http://wolframalpha.com&quot;&gt;WolframAlpha&lt;/a&gt; to find the derivative for you. Here's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=d%2Fdx+x%5E2&quot;&gt;an example&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=d%2Fdx+sin+x&quot;&gt;a more complicated example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;recap&quot;&gt;Recap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The derivative tells you the ratio of output change to input change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given an input change, you can use the derivative to estimate what the output change will be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can calculate the derivative yourself using the definition of the derivative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To calculate the derivative, you have to see what it is converging to as you make the change smaller aond smaller.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The derivative is potentially changing at every point!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember this important takeaway:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/how_output_will_change.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always use the definition to calculate the derivative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/definition_of_derivative.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a quick introduction to derivatives. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw&quot;&gt;3Blue1Brown&lt;/a&gt; also has good videos for building intuition on calculus. But maybe you are like me and want a complete, well-thought out course to study from, with practice questions, so you can say you truly understand calculus. If so, I cannot recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/learn/calculus1/home/welcome&quot;&gt;Jim Fowler's Coursera course&lt;/a&gt; highly enough. He is a terrific teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you want to read more illustrated math blog posts, &lt;a href=&quot;http://adit.io/posts/2017-12-05-A-Mind-Boggling-Probability-Problem.html&quot;&gt;check out my post on probability&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://adit.io/posts/2016-02-20-Linear-Regression-in-Pictures.html&quot;&gt;this one on linear regression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;bydalemarkowitz&quot;&gt;by Dale Markowitz&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An engineer pushes a small change and OkCupid goes up in flames.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://logicmag.io/content/images/2018/09/markowitz.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;A fire truck extinguishes a fire at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first things I learned after learning how to write software was how to write tests for that software. First you wrote code to perform a certain task—say, find the square root of a number. Then you wrote more code to test whether the first piece of code did what you wanted. Does the function return the correct value? Is two the square root of four?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought this type of testing was ridiculous. If you wrote buggy software, why would the software you wrote to check that software be any less buggy? That happened to me a lot: I’d spend twenty minutes trying to figure out why my tests said my programs were broken only to realize that the tests &lt;em&gt;themselves&lt;/em&gt; were broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet what I found even more troubling was that in order to write effective tests, a programmer had to know all of the ways that a piece of software could fail in order to write tests for those cases. If she forgot the square root of -1 was undefined, she’d never write a test for it. But, obviously, if you knew where your bugs were, you’d just fix them. Errors typically hide in the places we forget to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first employer, the online dating site OkCupid, didn’t harp on testing either. In part, this was because our company was so small. Only seven fellow engineers and I maintained all the code running on our servers—and making tests work was time-consuming and error-prone. “We can’t sacrifice forward momentum for technical debt,” then-CEO Mike Maxim told me, referring to the cost of engineers building behind-the-scenes tech instead of user-facing features. “Users don’t care.” He thought of testing frameworks as somewhat academic, more lofty than practical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the way we kept from breaking the site was to push updates to small subsets of users and watch what happened. Did anything crash? Did lag increase? Were users reporting new problems? The idea was that the best way to discover errors was to expose software to real site traffic and respond quickly with a patch or rollback if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this was a sensible methodology for a small engineering team. But when I first started at OkCupid, I found it terrifying. About four months in, I was assigned to build a feature that would highlight the interests that members listed on their profiles—things like “&lt;em&gt;Infinite Jest&lt;/em&gt;,” “meditation,” “The Dirty Projectors”—for OkCupid staff to see. Because this was an internal feature that users wouldn’t be able to access, the stakes were low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I was paranoid about breaking the site, and procrastinated. My boss, then-Director of Engineering David Koh, started to notice. “I know it’s intimidating,” he told me at the end of work one day, “but you just have to pull the trigger and launch the code. Soon you’ll do it without even thinking.” He told me to push my update the next day, when he’d be out of the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was nervous to make a change without David there to save me if anything went wrong. But, admittedly, my update was pretty dinky. The next morning, just to cover my tail, I asked Mike the CEO, who was also OkCupid’s best engineer, to take a look at my code. “You only added a few functions,” he said, reading through my lines on his monitor. “Looks fine.” I felt silly taking up his time for something so insignificant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I launched my new code for a fraction of our users and watched the statistics. All seemed well. I pushed my changes out to the rest of the site and went for a snack. When I came back, everything was most definitely not fine. The site had slowed to a crawl, and then became completely non-responsive. From the back corner of our single-floor office, the head of operations yelled, “The servers are on fire. What the hell’s going on?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It must’ve been me,” Mike shouted back. Mike and I had both deployed code at almost exactly the same time, a development no-no since when something broke (like now), you didn’t know who to blame. But when Mike reversed his change to no effect, he was stuck. It wouldn’t be long before the OkCupid servers became so unresponsive we wouldn’t even be able to connect to them to push our fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;panicfreakout&quot;&gt;#Panic #Freakout&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By lunch, we still hadn’t saved the site. OkCupid users were starting to notice on Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“@okcupid how am I supposed to get my daily dose of crushing rejection and emotional humiliation if your site is down????”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Okcupid stops working over lunch hour, NYC wonders if we're committed to the people in our phones from now on, panic in the streets”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“@okcupid How can I continue to be ignored by the females of the world if they don't know where I am to ignore me?! #panic #freakout”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more time that passed, the more confident I became, by process of elimination, that I’d taken down the site. I read through every file I’d changed—the lines of code I’d written and even the ones I hadn’t. Then, finally, I found the error. It looked something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If (the database throws an error) { do nothing }&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a bug, and I hadn’t even written it. I had just triggered it. But it was a bad bug, one that, under the right circumstances—circumstances that I’d unfortunately created—would not only crash the OkCupid servers but also spew radioactive garbage into our caches and database, making recovery especially difficult. I was horrified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could such a tiny change have such an outsized impact on the site? “That same story happened so many different times,” my old boss David told me. “Someone launched a small, relatively innocuous change that did one of the millions of unexpected things it could have done, which then happened to break some part of the site, and then bring it all down—sometimes bring it down to the point where we couldn’t recover it for hours.” When I saw him in the office the morning after I’d broken the site, totally mortified, he consoled me by saying that site outages were just the cost of relying on such a small engineering team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even large companies are susceptible to meltdowns caused by seemingly innocuous actions. In February 2017, Amazon accidently brought down swaths of the internet when one of its employees, trying to debug the company’s S3 service, entered a command incorrectly. Because hundreds of thousands of companies use S3 to store data, the error took down tons of sites, including Quora, Giphy, and Slack. Ironically, Amazon’s own S3 status indicator relied on S3, which is why it incorrectly reported that the service was working just fine during the outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;tangledwebs&quot;&gt;Tangled Webs&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most businesses, however, a software crash is not a death knell. If you’re not building self-driving cars, storing sensitive information, or supporting the data backbone of the internet, it may not matter if an error interrupts your service. It’s okay, for example, if a free online dating site goes down for an hour or half a day. In fact, it might even be better for business to trade off bugginess for forward momentum—the ethos behind Facebook’s old mantra “move fast and break things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you allow yourself to build imperfect systems, you start to work differently—faster, more ambitiously. You know that sometimes your system will go down and you’ll have to repair it, but that’s okay. “The fact that it’s easy to fix things means you end up with this methodology where you think, ‘Let’s get a broken thing out there as fast as possible that does sort of what we want, and then we’ll just fix it up,’” says David. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, since preventing errors is inherently difficult. “Even if you spend a whole bunch of time trying to make something that’s perfect, you won’t necessarily succeed,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OkCupid was a complex site. Had we tried to make it perfect, it might not have come to exist in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But software is built on top of other software. You’re working not just with your own code but with code from your coworkers and from third-party software libraries. If these dependencies are buggy or complicated or behave in non-intuitive ways, errors may seep into the software that relies on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the Equifax data breach, which leaked some 147.9 million Americans’ private information in September 2017. Equifax was vulnerable to attack not because of a bug introduced by one of its own engineers, but rather because of a bug in the code that Equifax’s software was built on top of—a popular open-source framework called Apache Struts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That bug had existed in Struts since 2008 but had gone unnoticed until 2017, when Apache finally released a patch. Until they installed the patch, the tens of thousands of companies that used Struts—including banks and government agencies—were hackable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Equifax didn’t install the patch until two months &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; Apache released it. Why the delay? According to testimony by Equifax executives before the House Energy and Commerce committee, the problem was twofold: first, the employee whose job it was to report that a patch was necessary didn’t. Second, an error in a software script meant to flag known vulnerabilities in Equifax’s software stack failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet even if Equifax &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; tried to install the patch, it wouldn’t have been an easy update. As &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; reported, the patch was difficult to install and could break existing systems, possibly introducing new bugs. That helps explain why, according to the software vendor Sonotype, some 46,557 companies downloaded vulnerable versions of Struts even after the patch came out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Equifax’s security procedures were sloppy and its breach completely preventable. Yet it’s easy for me to imagine a future bug with similarly catastrophic consequences that’s not so easy to blame on incompetence. Most complex software today is composite, consisting of interwoven modules written by many different programmers and maybe even many different organizations. The higher these code towers grow, the more difficult it becomes to understand how their various components interact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;pessimismoftheintellect&quot;&gt;Pessimism of the Intellect&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s for this reason that my own bug at OkCupid was so bad. I had written a function that asked the database to give me data that didn’t exist. It should’ve returned an error, stopping the program. But because of a bug in one of my dependencies—the bug I found reading through the code on the day of the crash—my program didn’t error out, but instead kept chugging along as if nothing were wrong. It kept consuming more and more memory, which eventually ate into almost every program running on our servers. That’s why the OkCupid site slowed down to the point of becoming unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the worst part of figuring out how I’d crashed OkCupid was that I was still too green to know how to fix it. All I could do was sit at my desk twiddling my thumbs in solidarity while my coworkers rebuilt what I’d destroyed. We stayed in the office until 9 PM. From then on, I came to appreciate how unexpectedly far fractures in a system can travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I heard you had an exciting day yesterday,” my boss David said the next morning. Mortified, I was sure I’d be fired. But I wasn’t, and instead I spent the next three months anxiously trying to prove to my coworkers that I wasn’t totally incompetent. I never brought the site down again, perhaps because my code-launching senses were heightened by a PTSD-induced adrenaline rush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’m still scarred or just generally pessimistic, but on the whole, I tend to think that all sufficiently large, complex software is prone to this kind of meltdown. It’s almost certainly impossible to prevent all bugs, and since code is composite, it’s even harder to reason about the consequences of those bugs. A successful developer today needs to be as good at writing code as she is at extinguishing that code when it explodes.&lt;/p&gt;

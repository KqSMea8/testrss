<title>Numpy: Plan for dropping Python 2.7 support</title>
<link>https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/neps/dropping-python2.7-proposal.rst</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/neps/dropping-python2.7-proposal.rst</guid>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;The Python core team plans to stop supporting Python 2 in 2020. The NumPy project has supported both Python 2 and Python 3 in parallel since 2010, and has found that supporting Python 2 is an increasing burden on our limited resources; thus, we plan to eventually drop Python 2 support as well. Now that we're entering the final years of community-supported Python 2, the NumPy project wants to clarify our plans, with the goal of to helping our downstream ecosystem make plans and accomplish the transition with as little disruption as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our current plan is as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until &lt;strong&gt;December 31, 2018&lt;/strong&gt;, all NumPy releases will fully support both Python2 and Python3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting on &lt;strong&gt;January 1, 2019&lt;/strong&gt;, any new feature releases will support only Python3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last Python2 supporting release will be designated as a long term support (LTS) release, meaning that we will continue to merge bug fixes and make bug fix releases for a longer period than usual. Specifically, it will be supported by the community until &lt;strong&gt;December 31, 2019&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;January 1, 2020&lt;/strong&gt; we will raise a toast to Python2, and community support for the last Python2 supporting release will come to an end. However, it will continue to be available on PyPI indefinitely, and if any commercial vendors wish to extend the LTS support past this point then we are open to letting them use the LTS branch in the official NumPy repository to coordinate that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a NumPy user who requires ongoing Python2 support in 2020 or later, then please contact your vendor. If you are a vendor who wishes to continue to support NumPy on Python2 in 2020+, please get in touch; ideally we'd like you to get involved in maintaining the LTS before it actually hits end of life so that we can make a clean handoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To minimize disruption, running &lt;code&gt;pip install numpy&lt;/code&gt; on Python 2 will continue to give the last working release in perpetuity, but after January 1, 2019 it may not contain the latest features, and after January 1, 2020 it may not contain the latest bug fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information on the scientific Python ecosystem's transition to Python3 only, see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.python3statement.org/&quot;&gt;python3-statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information on porting your code to run on Python 3, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html&quot;&gt;python3-howto&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video: US to invest $258M in supercomputer race with China&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Linux rules supercomputing. This day has been coming since 1998, when Linux first appeared on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.top500.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TOP500 Supercomputer list&lt;/a&gt;. Today it finally happened: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.top500.org/statistics/sublist/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;All 500 of the world's fastest supercomputers are running Linux&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last two non-Linux systems, a pair of Chinese IBM POWER computers running AIX, dropped off the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.top500.org/news/china-pulls-ahead-of-us-in-latest-top500-list/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;November 2017 TOP500 Supercomputer list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zdnet.com/article/now-china-outguns-us-in-top-supercomputer-showdown/&quot;&gt;China now leads the supercomputing race with 202 computers to the US' 144&lt;/a&gt;. China also leads the US in aggregate performance. China's supercomputers represent 35.4 percent of the Top500's flops, while the US trails with 29.6 percent. With an anti-science regime in charge of the government, America will only continue to see its technological lead decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the &lt;a href=&quot;http://top500.org/project/introduction&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;first Top500 supercomputer list was compiled in June 1993&lt;/a&gt;, Linux was barely more than a toy. It hadn't even adopted Tux as its mascot yet. It didn't take long for Linux to start its march on supercomputing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1993/1994, at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Donald Becker and Thomas Sterling designed a Commodity Off The Shelf (COTS) supercomputer: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beowulf.org/overview/faq.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Beowulf&lt;/a&gt;. Since they couldn't afford a traditional supercomputer, they built a cluster computer made up of 16 Intel 486 DX4 processors, which were connected by channel bonded Ethernet. This &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beowulf.org/overview/history.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Beowulf supercomputer&lt;/a&gt; was an instant success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this day, the Beowulf design remains a popular, inexpensive way of designing supercomputers. Indeed, in the latest Top500 list, 437 of the world's fastest computers are using cluster designs that owe a debt of gratitude to Beowulf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux first appeared on the Top500 in 1998. Before Linux took the lead, Unix was supercomputing's top operating system. Since 2003, the Top500 was on its way to Linux domination. By 2004, Linux had taken the lead for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;sharethrough-top&quot; data-component=&quot;medusaContentRecommendation&quot; data-medusa-content-recommendation-options=&quot;{&amp;quot;promo&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;promo_ZD_recommendation_sharethrough_top_in_article_desktop&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;spot&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;dfp-in-article&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Linux [became] the driving force behind the breakthroughs in computing power that have fueled research and technological innovation,&quot; as reported by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linux.com/publications/20-years-top500org-supercomputer-data-links-linux-advances-computing-performance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Linux Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; In other words, Linux is dominant in supercomputing, at least in part, because it is helping researchers push the limits on computing power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happened for two reasons: First, because most of the world's top supercomputers are research machines built for specialized tasks, each machine is a standalone project with unique characteristics and optimization requirements. To save costs, no one wants to develop a custom operating system for each of these systems. With Linux, however, research teams can easily modify and optimize Linux's open-source code to their one-off designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zdnet.com/article/the-new-long-term-linux-kernel-linux-4-14-has-arrived/&quot;&gt;Linux 4.14&lt;/a&gt; enables supercomputers to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=bffc33ec539699f045a9254144de3d4eace05f07&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Heterogeneous Memory Management (HMM)&lt;/a&gt;. This enables GPUs and CPUs to access a process's shared address space. Exactly 102 of the Top500 are using now using GPU accelerator/co-processor technology. All of these will perform better, thanks to HMM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, just as importantly, as the Linux Foundation pointed out, &quot;The licensing cost of a custom, self-supported Linux distribution is the same, whether you're using 20 nodes or 20-million nodes.&quot; Thus, &quot;by tapping into the vast open-source Linux community, projects had access to free support and developer resources to help keep developer costs on par with, or below other operating systems.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that Linux has reached the apex of supercomputing, I can't imagine it losing its leadership. It will take a hardware revolution, such as quantum computing, to shake Linux's supercomputing grip. Of course, Linux may still reign since &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/2017/ocw//system/presentations/4704/original/QC-slides.2017.09.13f.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;IBM developers are already working on porting Linux to quantum computers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Fight to Mine Your Data and Sell It to Your Boss</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-11-15/the-brutal-fight-to-mine-your-data-and-sell-it-to-your-boss</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-11-15/the-brutal-fight-to-mine-your-data-and-sell-it-to-your-boss</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;On May 23, an email landed in the sales inbox of a San Francisco startup called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1383039D:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot;&gt;HiQ Labs&lt;/a&gt;, politely asking the company to go out of business. HiQ is a “people analytics” firm that creates &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hiqlabs.com/new-index&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Solutions — hiQ Labs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;software tools&lt;/a&gt; for corporate human resources departments. Its Skill Mapper graphically represents the credentials and abilities of a workforce; its Keeper service identifies when employees are at risk of leaving for another job. Both draw the overwhelming majority of their data from a single trove: the material that is posted—with varying degrees of timeliness, detail, accuracy, and self-awareness—by the 500 million people on the social networking site &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;LinkedIn: Log In or Sign Up&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The email HiQ received was from LinkedIn Senior Litigation Counsel Abhishek Bajoria. “It has come to LinkedIn’s attention that hiQ Labs, Inc. has used and is using processes to improperly, and without authorization, access and copy data from LinkedIn’s website” in violation of LinkedIn’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;User Agreement | LinkedIn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;user agreement&lt;/a&gt;, it read. Bajoria called on HiQ to cease and desist from visiting LinkedIn’s site and to destroy the data it had culled. The email set off a feud that led, a month later, to the two companies meeting in federal court, with HiQ suing LinkedIn and LinkedIn accusing HiQ of violating state and federal law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small number of the world’s most valuable companies collect, control, parse, and sell billions of dollars’ worth of personal information voluntarily surrendered by their users. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GOOG:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FB:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AMZN:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot;&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MSFT:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;—which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-13/microsoft-to-buy-linkedin-in-deal-valued-at-26-2-billion-ipe079k9&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Microsoft Pays $26 Billion for LinkedIn in Biggest Deal Yet&quot;&gt;bought LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; for $26.2 billion in 2016—have in turn spawned dependent economies consisting of advertising and marketing companies, designers, consultants, and app developers. Some operate on the tech giants’ platforms; some customize special digital tools; some help people attract more friends and likes and followers. Some, including HiQ, feed off the torrents of information that social networks produce, using software bots to scrape data from profiles. The services of the smaller companies can augment the offerings of the bigger ones, but the power dynamic is deeply asymmetrical, reminiscent of pilot fish picking food from between the teeth of sharks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The terms of that relationship are set by technology, economics, and the vagaries of consumer choice, but also by the law. LinkedIn’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.reuters.com/resources/media/editorial/20170620/hiqvlinkedin--ceaseanddesist.pdf&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;EXHIBIT J (.pdf)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;May 23 letter to HiQ&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t the first time the company had taken legal action to prevent the perceived hijacking of its data, and Facebook Inc. and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/371007Z:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot;&gt;Craigslist Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, among others, have brought &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Craigslist-sues-Instamotor-for-allegedly-11107880.php&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Craigslist sues Instamotor for allegedly re-posting car ads&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;similar actions&lt;/a&gt;. But even more than its predecessors, this case, because of who’s involved and how it’s unfolded, has spoken to the thorniest issues surrounding speech and competition on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The courtroom clash in July drew some of the biggest names in the American litigation bar and split some of the web’s high-profile civil liberties watchdog organizations, with the Electronic Frontier Foundation coming out in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/08/judge-cracks-down-linkedins-shameful-abuse-computer-break-law&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Judge Cracks Down on LinkedIn’s Shameful Abuse of Computer Break-In Law&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;support of HiQ&lt;/a&gt; and the Electronic Privacy Information Center writing an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epic.org/amicus/cfaa/linkedin/hiQ-v-LinkedIn-EPIC-Amicus-Brief.pdf&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Brief of Amicus Curiae Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) in Support of Neither Party Urging Reversal (.pdf)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;amicus brief for LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on whom you talk to, the sides are arguing about free speech or privacy, the scourge of data scraping or the danger of digital monopolies. The outcome will determine who gets to control the wealth of information about ourselves that, often unwittingly, we’ve put at the disposal of anyone with a professional curiosity and an internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;“People analytics” is a new term, but the concept is as old as the office job. Psychology had barely been founded before its practitioners were identifying the traits of a good streetcar driver or telephone switchboard operator. In 1917 a group of prominent psychologists was asked to evaluate and sort the hundreds of thousands of young men being drafted into the U.S. Army to fight in Europe. The ensuing decades saw the American military and intelligence agencies become centers of research for psychological evaluation and aptitude testing; after World War II, many of their scientists were hired to head personnel research departments at AT&amp;amp;T, General Electric, General Motors, and other iconic corporations. There they subjected armies of salesmen, bankers, engineers, and middle managers to surveys and aptitude tests, simulations and role-playing games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;passage&quot;&gt;“Imagine you had the wherewithal to see that autonomous vehicle experts were migrating out of Google into Apple before it became public”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, in practice the selection and retention of talent remains more art than science—and often primitive art, at that. At most companies, HR isn’t where the most interesting thinking is happening. But that’s changing, as the data scientists who brought us Amazon recommendation engines, online ad auctions, and dating algorithms apply predictive analytics to how we think and act at work. The goal is to go beyond traditional but little-examined practices—for instance, the job interview (often &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.courant.com/opinion/op-ed/hc-op-wire-sunstein-hiring-interviews-not-helpful--20161104-story.html&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Hiring? Don't Bother With The Interview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;useless&lt;/a&gt;) and the raise (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-09/we-care-less-about-what-we-re-paid-than-why&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;We Care Less About What We’re Paid Than Why&quot;&gt;not always the best way&lt;/a&gt; to retain talent)—to subtler metrics and methods. Big companies are growing more interested as the cost of replacing valued workers becomes clearer. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/CSGN:SW&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot;&gt;Credit Suisse Group&lt;/a&gt; recently estimated that reducing attrition by 1 percentage point saves the bank from $75 million to $100 million a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s where HiQ comes in. The company was the brainchild of Darren Kaplan, a former ad man who saw that sites such as monster.com, glassdoor.com, and, above all, LinkedIn had upended the balance of power between employers and employees. LinkedIn’s founding in 2002 had given workers a new platform for marketing themselves and made it easier for recruiters (not to mention business journalists) to find and woo them. Its economic model is built, in large part, on charging for special recruiter memberships—they run about $9,000 a year, and companies often buy more than one—that help with finding and contacting potential poaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaplan envisioned a technological defense against the forays of recruiters, an early warning system that would assist companies in identifying restless workers so their bosses could entice them to stay. (“Predictive attrition insights” is the term HiQ has come to use.) In January 2015, the company rolled out Keeper, in which variables such as “independence from employer brand,” “mobility history,” and “external footprint” are displayed on a color-coded dashboard and combined to calculate a worker’s “flight risk.” Skill Mapper was released earlier this year, not long after the company hired Mark Weidick as chief executive officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;lazy-img-320435543&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ivIA.8D6vcAo/v1/60x-1.jpg&quot; data-native-src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ivIA.8D6vcAo/v1/-1x-1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img__image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weidick, HiQ’s CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photographer: Jared Soares for Bloomberg Businessweek&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An engineer and entrepreneur who’s worked at Cisco Systems Inc. and AT&amp;amp;T Inc., Weidick has the graying crew cut and earnest intensity of a high school debate team coach. “I can’t help keeping track of time,” he says apologetically, after our conversation strays from the presentation on the conference room screen beside us. He describes HiQ’s limited offerings as the first building blocks of a workforce analytics arsenal. Investors evaluating a prospective merger would pay good money, he argues, to know who’s likely to stay at a company and who might leave. “Imagine you had the wherewithal to see that autonomous vehicle experts were migrating out of Google into Apple before it became public,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco and other software companies already perform this sort of analysis when they’re scouting offices, surveying the talent landscape in candidate cities to see which is the best fit. HiQ’s pitch is that it can offer clients something comparable through data science backed by off-the-shelf software and tailored consulting. Reviews have been good. “My experience working with them has been fantastic,” says an HR executive at a HiQ customer with more than 20,000 employees. (Like other clients, he was leery of being quoted by name while the case was going on.) “They are really smart about the data and about presenting it so that it’s used to improve business and employee outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weidick had been on the job for only three months when LinkedIn sent its cease-and-desist letter, and his first thought was that there had been a misunderstanding. Many of HiQ’s 26 employees came from LinkedIn, and one of the startup’s co-founders, Rob Desantis, had been an early LinkedIn investor and board member. LinkedIn staff regularly attended an annual people analytics conference HiQ hosted. Two weeks after receiving the letter, Weidick wrote a bewildered email to LinkedIn’s general counsel, likening himself to “a dolphin that got caught in the tuna net.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others at HiQ were less surprised. Even as LinkedIn employees mingled at HiQ’s conferences, its software engineers were implementing measures to block data scrapers, setting off a cat-and-mouse game with HiQ’s engineers. “LinkedIn had been aggressively complaining about what they considered unfair scraping practices for quite some time,” recalls Dan Miller, HiQ’s chief technology officer. “They went through a lot of trouble technically to make it difficult to collate that data. We obviously think they’re dead wrong to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, as far as LinkedIn was concerned, HiQ was the tuna. When the larger company’s lawyers made that clear to Weidick, he hired the law firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/531016L:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot;&gt;Farella Braun &amp;amp; Martel&lt;/a&gt;. Deepak Gupta, a partner there, thought the case might interest his former professor, Laurence Tribe. Tribe, who teaches at Harvard Law School, is a constitutional law luminary and a liberal icon for arguing Supreme Court cases that expanded First Amendment protections and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_v._Texas&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;sought to overturn&lt;/a&gt; state anti-sodomy laws. He has also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.masseygail.com/pdf/Tribe-Peabody_111(d)_Comments_(filed).pdf&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;COMMENTS OF LAURENCE H.

Among other things, he’s writing a book, teaching a new law school course, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-23/lawsuit-over-trump-s-foreign-dealings-plows-uncharted-ground&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Trump’s Foreign Dealings Violate Constitution, Suit Claims&quot;&gt;suing President Trump for corruption&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tribe has a weakness for certain internet law questions, though. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://epic.org/free_speech/tribe.html&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;The Constitution in Cyberspace: Law and Liberty Beyond the Electronic Frontier&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;seminal 1991 talk&lt;/a&gt;, he sought to delineate how the Constitution, written in the language of physical space and boundaries, should apply in the virtual reaches of cyberspace. What were the public squares and private rooms of the web? Who got to determine access? Should data be protected as speech? If so, how? Back then the internet was an exotic geek playground, but even though it’s now a global marketplace where trillions of dollars change hands, the courts have only begun to answer Tribe’s questions. When Gupta called, talking about a battle over control of social media data, Tribe says, “my constitutional nostrils flared.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 27 he took a seat next to Gupta and another Farella partner in a federal courtroom in San Francisco for the second hearing in the case. HiQ had &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/2017_0814_hiq_order.pdf&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;HIQ LABS, INC. v. LINKEDIN CORPORATION (.pdf)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;sued LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; for unfair business practices and violating the smaller company’s right to free speech under the state constitution, which has broader speech protections than the U.S. Constitution. The startup wasn’t seeking damages, only asking Judge Edward Chen to issue a preliminary injunction that would force LinkedIn to let HiQ use its data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verrilli, representing LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photographer: Jared Soares for Bloomberg Businessweek&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguing LinkedIn’s case was Donald Verrilli, who served as solicitor general under President Obama, and others from the firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/31836Z:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot;&gt;Munger, Tolles &amp;amp; Olson&lt;/a&gt;. The demand LinkedIn had made in its cease-and-desist letter to HiQ rested largely on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;18 U.S. Code § 1030 - Fraud and related activity in connection with computers | US Law | LII / Legal Information Institute&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Computer Fraud and Abuse Act&lt;/a&gt; (CFAA), which makes it a federal crime, with a potential punishment of 10 years in prison, to access a computer without authorization. The 1984 law has been amended multiple times, but its earliest version was meant to protect against a &lt;em&gt;WarGames&lt;/em&gt;-style hack of government mainframes. LinkedIn was contending that, although people who posted on the site owned their own data, that data was stored on LinkedIn servers, and HiQ was trespassing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HiQ’s data scraping not only violated LinkedIn’s user agreement, it also threatened the “privacy interest of LinkedIn’s members,” Verrilli told Judge Chen, “and the integrity of LinkedIn’s trust relationship with its members, which is essential to its business.” Keeper, Verrilli added, let companies snoop on LinkedIn members in ways they hadn’t signed up for and wouldn’t want: “It’s an anonymous surveillance of their behavior, to rat them out to their employers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta countered that Verrilli was mischaracterizing HiQ’s methods and products. LinkedIn members have the option to mark their profiles entirely private or entirely public, with gradations in between. HiQ made use only of the data LinkedIn members had indicated they wanted visible to everyone on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For LinkedIn, however, the key distinction wasn’t between public and private or visible and invisible, but between a person browsing a website and a bot brigade copying data at scale. LinkedIn’s lawyers offer an analogy in one of their briefs: The site is like “a massive job fair, held at a convention center and open to all comers.” Into this gathering HiQ sends a metaphorical swarm of interns wearing body cameras so it can track the movements of every attendee and sell the resulting information to their employers. “LinkedIn would be well within its rights,” Verrilli and his colleagues conclude, “to send a letter instructing HiQ and its camera-clad minions to stay out of its fair.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;passage&quot;&gt;“We can’t sit here today and police every possible business model that some entrepreneur in Silicon Valley might come up with”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;Surveillance is a loaded word, one HiQ doesn’t like. But the pitch such companies make is that they can pick up faint signals in public data that would otherwise go unnoticed. Those signals can reveal things that weren’t actually intended to be public: the tastes and tendencies evinced by our web search patterns, the medical condition revealed by our buying history, our growing boredom with our job. Last year the American Civil Liberties Union discovered that an analytics company called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0611063D:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot;&gt;Dataminr Inc.&lt;/a&gt; was allowing law enforcement and domestic intelligence analysts to use special keyword and location search tools to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/internet-privacy/twitter-cuts-fusion-spy-centers-access-social-media&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Twitter Cuts Off Fusion Spy Centers’ Access to Social Media Surveillance Tool&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;track people through Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, which partially owns the company. (Dataminr has since discontinued the practice.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data-scraping bots are only one of the technologies forcing us to rethink privacy protections. In 2012 the Supreme Court ruled in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.casebriefsummary.com/united-states-v-jones/&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;United States v. Jones | Case Brief Summary&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;United States v. Jones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that when the police affixed a GPS tracking device to a car, they were invading the privacy of the driver, even though it would have been perfectly legal to gather the same information by following the car around. Verrilli, the solicitor general at the time, lost that case, but speaking by phone in early October, he praises the decision. “What the court said, and it’s directly applicable here, is ‘No, no. This is a difference in kind, not merely in degree,’ ” he says. “It’s a level of intrusion and a level of surveillance that you could not as a practical matter ever accomplish absent the use of this super-high-powered technology.” The expense and labor of old-fashioned surveillance imposed practical limits on its use, but just as today’s cops—provided they can get a warrant—need not physically tail someone to know where he spends his time, people analytics professionals need not rely on a battery of tests and role-playing games to get inside employees’ heads. The easier it gets to harvest and analyze information, the more actively that information has to be protected. That, Verrilli argues, is what LinkedIn is trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s LinkedIn, after all, not HiQ, that has the relationship with the members who have posted the information. “We’ve made promises in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Privacy Policy | LinkedIn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;, and we have to work with regulators worldwide who hold us to our promises,” says Blake Lawit, LinkedIn’s vice president for legal. “We’re not under the radar, right? If we do something creepy with privacy, we’re going to hear about it from the FTC and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-02-09/can-irelands-regulators-stand-up-for-internet-privacy&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Can Ireland's Regulators Stand Up for Internet Privacy?&quot;&gt;Irish Data Protection Commissioner&lt;/a&gt; and et cetera.” In other words, LinkedIn might be big and know lots about us, but with great power comes regulatory scrutiny, and with that comes a kind of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;lazy-img-320435494&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iQrs20A0xk.E/v1/60x-1.jpg&quot; data-native-src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iQrs20A0xk.E/v1/-1x-1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img__image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, representing HiQ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photographer: Jared Soares for Bloomberg Businessweek&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that argument is only somewhat reassuring, HiQ’s argument is effectively that we’re on our own, and that this is the price we pay for today’s internet. “There’s probably lots and lots of applications that might make someone feel a little queasy, right?” Gupta told Judge Chen. “But the thing is, we can’t sit here today and police every possible business model that some entrepreneur in Silicon Valley might come up with. It’s public information. It’s the marketplace of ideas. It’s the engine of our country’s growth.” The reason Google can put the entire internet at our fingertips is because, like HiQ, it scrapes public data. That includes LinkedIn pages, which is why they tend to be among the top results if you Google a noncelebrity (unlike HiQ, Google has LinkedIn’s explicit permission to collect data).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, even those who might prefer that someone act as the guardian of our data might not cast LinkedIn for the role. The company doesn’t have the size or sway of Facebook, but as a business networking site it has no real competition, and like Facebook its dominance is built on the wealth of data it controls. This summer, Bala Iyer, Mohan Subramaniam, and U. Srinivasa Rangan wrote an article in the &lt;em&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em&gt; arguing that the rise of Facebook, Google, Amazon, and the like necessitated a &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2017/07/the-next-battle-in-antitrust-will-be-about-whether-one-company-knows-everything-about-you&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;The Next Battle in Antitrust Will Be About Whether One Company Knows Everything About You&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;rethinking of the idea of a monopoly&lt;/a&gt;. “Tomorrow’s monopolies won’t be able to be measured just by how much they sell us,” the authors wrote. “They’ll be based on how much they know about us and how much better they can predict our behavior than competitors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old considerations—Is pricing competitive? Does the consumer have alternatives?—haven’t gone away, but they’ve been augmented by new questions. Companies that control data capable of predicting their customers’ choices could, for example, figure out how to constrain those choices, making such dominance all the more durable. As HiQ’s lawyers were at pains to point out, LinkedIn itself is in the data-mining business and is thus a competitor to HiQ. The larger company offers a service called Update Me as part of its premium membership for recruiters. As its name suggests, the product alerts recruiters when particular people change their LinkedIn pages, mark a work anniversary, or do something else that might signal a recruitable moment. Keeper, by contrast, updates its risk profiles only monthly, not in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta made sure in court to carefully highlight the hypocrisy of a sentence from LinkedIn’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/2015/04/linkedin-recruiter-tip-use-update-me-to-know-when-to-reach-out-to-prospects&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;LinkedIn Recruiter Tip: Use Update Me to Know When to Reach Out to Prospects&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;promotional pitch to recruiters&lt;/a&gt;: “And don’t worry—they don’t know you’re following them.” In his telling, LinkedIn wasn’t trying to prevent its members’ data from being mined and analyzed: it was just trying to muscle out a smaller competitor so it could have a new market to itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;Like most legal disputes, the one between LinkedIn and HiQ is a battle of analogies, and near the end of the proceedings on July 27, Verrilli introduced one more. The information in your local library is public, but that doesn’t mean, he argued, “that you can break into the library with a crowbar at 2 in the morning because you’re seized with a desire to read &lt;em&gt;Moby-Dick&lt;/em&gt;.” Libraries can impose reasonable limits on public information, and so, he said, can LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later, Tribe rose to speak for the first time. When he was growing up, he recalled, library books had “a little tag inside that would tell you how often the book was taken out, and when.” Imagine, he went on, that someone wanted to collate that information to see what books were most popular. “For the government to make it a crime for me to make use of that information because they want to be the, perhaps, exclusive distributors of information about what’s popular to read would, of course, be unconstitutional.” That calculation didn’t change, Tribe argued, if it was a corporation rather than the government establishing the ban. “If LinkedIn has this power, so does Facebook, and the entire universe of cyberspace can be gobbled up by a small number of private owners,” he said. “That can’t be what the law of an open, democratic society with the First Amendment means.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;lazy-img-320435583&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i1qKHa1PDL4M/v1/60x-1.jpg&quot; data-native-src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i1qKHa1PDL4M/v1/-1x-1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img__image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tribe, representing HiQ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photographer: Jared Soares for Bloomberg Businessweek&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Aug. 14, Judge Chen issued his &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/candce/3:2017cv03301/312704/63&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;ORDER by Judge Edward M for hiQ Labs, Inc. v. Linkedin Corporation :: Justia Dockets &amp;amp; Filings&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;ruling&lt;/a&gt;, and it was in favor of HiQ. He emphatically rejected LinkedIn’s interpretation of the CFAA, which would, he wrote, give a private company the power to choke off access to public data, with prohibitions “weaponized by the potential of criminal sanctions.” And although Chen was skeptical of some of Tribe’s broader First Amendment arguments, he thought HiQ had raised serious questions about antitrust violations. He arched a rhetorical eyebrow at how LinkedIn, purported guardian of its members’ secrets, enthusiastically marketed data-mining capabilities of its own “in a way that seems to afford little deference to the very privacy concerns it professes to be protecting in this case.” Chen also took the extraordinary step of enjoining LinkedIn from putting in place any measure, technological as well as legal, to prevent HiQ from accessing its site, and he ordered the company to remove any barriers already in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking a few weeks after the ruling, Lawit, LinkedIn’s vice president for legal, still seemed blindsided: “When did it happen that companies who have data are forced to provide all of it with no conditions to anyone who wants it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At HiQ, the mood was predictably cheerier—“high-fives all around,” in Weidick’s description. Still, the costs of the litigation had been substantial. Precious startup capital had been spent on lawyers, and countless man-hours had been devoted to trying, unsuccessfully, to come up with a business model that wouldn’t depend on LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn swiftly announced that it would take its case to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which, in the past, has been favorable to companies invoking the CFAA against data scrapers. The soonest the case would be heard by the appeals court is in early 2018, and a Supreme Court decision, should the case make it that far, wouldn’t come for a few years. That’s an eon for a tech startup: By then, HiQ might actually be the analytics powerhouse its CEO, Weidick, envisions, or it might be defunct and remembered only as a cautionary tale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The publicity around the case has led to more potential customers reaching out, Weidick says, but in recent months HiQ has also lost most of its employees, as more than a dozen data scientists, designers, and programmers, calculating the odds, have left for jobs at places not shadowed by an existential legal battle. That much attrition would be painful for any company, but it’s particularly galling for one in the attrition-insight business. “The irony is not lost on me,” Weidick says. “Not at all.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Code together in real time with Teletype for Atom</title>
<link>https://blog.atom.io/2017/11/15/code-together-in-real-time-with-teletype-for-atom.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.atom.io/2017/11/15/code-together-in-real-time-with-teletype-for-atom.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.atom.io/img/posts/teletype/original-teletype.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Old-school teletype&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing code with another programmer is a great way to absorb knowledge, challenge yourself with new perspectives, and ultimately write better software. It can also be a fulfilling way to get to know the mind of another human being. Unfortunately, the &lt;em&gt;logistics&lt;/em&gt; of writing code with another programmer can be such a hassle that many people don’t bother. Here are some of the common obstacles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sharing the same physical machine is impossible for remote teams, and can be challenging to organize even when teammates share the same office.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud-based IDEs and remote &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tmux&lt;/code&gt; sessions ask you to move your entire workflow into a hosted environment, which isn’t always possible or desirable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The connection latency of screen sharing can lead to an awkward dynamic where only one collaborator can comfortably edit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social coding shouldn’t have to be this hard! Today, we’re taking a first step toward making it just as easy to code together as it is to code alone with &lt;a href=&quot;https://teletype.atom.io&quot;&gt;Teletype for Atom&lt;/a&gt;. At the dawn of computing, teletypes were used to create a real-time circuit between two machines so that anything typed on one machine appeared at the other end immediately. Following in these electro-mechanical footsteps, Teletype for Atom wires the keystrokes of remote collaborators directly into your programming environment, enabling conflict-free, low-latency collaborative editing for any file you can open in Atom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.atom.io/img/posts/teletype/teletype.png&quot; alt=&quot;Atom Teletype&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-started-with-teletype&quot;&gt;Getting started with Teletype&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you install Teletype via Atom’s settings view or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apm install teletype&lt;/code&gt; on the command line, you can open a “portal” into your local workspace from the new collaboration menu on the status bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.atom.io/img/posts/teletype/share.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Share your portal and copy its secret ID&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then just share your portal’s secret ID with collaborators via your preferred chat service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.atom.io/img/posts/teletype/invite.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Send the portal ID to a collaborator via a chat service&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaborators can enter your portal by clicking “Join” in the collaboration menu and entering the portal ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.atom.io/img/posts/teletype/join.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Once someone has your portal ID, they can join&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After joining your portal, collaborators see a new tab in their workspace that lets them view and edit the contents of your active editor. Everyone gets their own cursor, and everyone can type at the same time, but since sharing is at the keystroke-level rather than the pixel-level, participants all keep their own custom key bindings, packages, and themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.atom.io/img/posts/teletype/code-together.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Everyone gets a cursor&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you share a portal, your code stays on your local disk. As you switch between files, the contents of your current active editor are transmitted to collaborators so they can follow along, but otherwise your workflow will be unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.atom.io/img/posts/teletype/follow.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Guests follow the host&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;implementation-details&quot;&gt;Implementation details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conflict-free-editing&quot;&gt;Conflict-free editing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaborative editing is a tricky theoretical problem. To ensure responsive editing, each collaborator maintains their own replica of each document, applying local edits immediately before transmitting them to other collaborators. In the face of concurrency, edits end up being applied in a different order on each replica, but when the dust settles, all replicas need to have the same contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several late nights reading research papers, we ended up deciding to base Teletype on the theoretical framework of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type&quot;&gt;conflict-free replicated data types&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;CRDTs&lt;/em&gt;. Basically, CRDTs are data structures that always converge on the same representation when updated with the same set of operations, even if those operations are applied in different orders. The CRDT for text editing we wrote for the heart of this system is available as a standalone library called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/atom/teletype-crdt&quot;&gt;teletype-crdt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;connecting-peers&quot;&gt;Connecting peers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To connect collaborators, we use &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API&quot;&gt;WebRTC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCDataChannel&quot;&gt;data channels&lt;/a&gt;. After an initial handshake that exchanges connection metadata via GitHub’s servers, all data flows over encrypted peer-to-peer connections. Our servers never see your files or edits, which maximizes your privacy and minimizes latency between you and your collaborators, regardless of your proximity to our data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;editor-agnostic-client-library&quot;&gt;Editor-agnostic client library&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/atom/teletype&quot;&gt;Teletype Atom package&lt;/a&gt; implements UI components and Atom-specific integration code, but most of the logic lives in an editor-agnostic library called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/atom/teletype-client&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;teletype-client&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Our protocols and API may churn for a while as we develop the system, but it should be possible to integrate &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;teletype-client&lt;/code&gt; into any web-based application or even package it in an Electron-based server to talk to it from native editors. Supporting inter-operation between different text editors is definitely part of our long term vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;carriage-return-line-feed&quot;&gt;Carriage return, line feed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, Teletype only transmits text, so it’s a good idea to combine it with an application for voice communication. Traditional screen sharing can also be helpful for sharing the state of applications outside of Atom. Ultimately, we want to incorporate these kinds of features directly into the package along with a long list of other improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But rather than waiting for perfection, we are releasing a beta version of this package now, because we think it’s useful today. We’ve been using Teletype to build Teletype for a few months now, happily working together across two continents and three time zones. Daily teletyping has made us happier and more productive, and we hope it will do the same for you and your teammates.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Code together in real time with Teletype for Atom</og:title>
<og:description>Writing code with another programmer is a great way to absorb knowledge, challenge yourself with new perspectives, and ultimately write better software. It can also be a fulfilling way to get to know the mind of another human being. Unfortunately, the logistics of writing code with another programmer can be such a hassle that many people don’t bother. Here are some of the common obstacles: Sharing the same physical machine is impossible for remote teams, and can be challenging to organize even when teammates share the same office. Cloud-based IDEs and remote tmux sessions ask you to move your entire workflow into a hosted environment, which isn’t always possible or desirable. The connection latency of screen sharing can lead to an awkward dynamic where only one collaborator can comfortably edit. Social coding shouldn’t have to be this hard! Today, we’re taking a first step toward making it just as easy to code together as it is to code alone with Teletype for Atom. At the dawn of computing, teletypes were used to create a real-time circuit between two machines so that anything typed on one machine appeared at the other end immediately. Following in these electro-mechanical footsteps, Teletype for Atom wires the keystrokes of remote collaborators directly into your programming environment, enabling conflict-free, low-latency collaborative editing for any file you can open in Atom.</og:description>

<title>Visual Studio Live Share</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/11/15/live-share</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;November 15, 2017 Amanda Silver, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/amandaksilver&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@amandaksilver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are excited to announce that we’re working on “Visual Studio Live Share”, which enables developers using Visual Studio 2017 or Visual Studio Code to collaborate in real-time! Learn more about Live Share and the upcoming limited private preview &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/visual-studio-live-share&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_what-is-live-share&quot; data-needslink=&quot;_what-is-live-share&quot;&gt;What is Live Share?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live Share enables your team to quickly collaborate on the same codebase without the need to synchronize code or to configure the same development tools, settings, or environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to Live Share, seeing is believing. Watch the following video to get an idea of what we are working on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you share a collaborative session, your teammate sees the context of the workspace in their editor. This means your teammate can read the code you shared without having to clone a repo or install any dependencies your code relies on. They can use rich language features to navigate within the code; not only just opening other files as text but using semantic analysis-based navigation like Go to Definition or Peek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/blogs/2017/11/15/vs-code-ls-session.png&quot; alt=&quot;Live Sharing with VS Code&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your teammate edits a file, they get editor enhancements like IntelliSense, statement completion, and suggestions. Each of you can open files, navigate, edit code, highlight, or refactor - and changes are instantly reflected. As you edit you can see your teammate’s cursor, jump to the location of your teammate’s carat, or follow their actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaborative debugging goes further, allowing you and your teammate to independently inspect objects using debugging features like hovers, locals and watches, the stack trace or the debug console. You are both able to set breakpoints and advance the debug cursor to step through the session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/blogs/2017/11/15/vs-code-ls-session2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Live Sharing with VS Code&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_why-live-share&quot; data-needslink=&quot;_why-live-share&quot;&gt;Why Live Share?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft Teams and Slack bring dynamic team collaboration into a digital form, there is more we can do to make it easier to work together in a development team. Screen-sharing or accessing a machine remotely means that only one person is in control while the other observes. Instant messaging, email, or other tools are great for basic messages but collaborating on a body of code often requires more than a code snippet or a single file to share the necessary context. Additionally, the validity of edits can be impacted by multiple files in the workspace. If you want to replicate your teammate’s environment, it just takes a lot of time to get everything set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live Share allows you to share the context of the code, so you get instant, bidirectional collaboration. Each of you can use a tool that you’ve personalized so you’re the most productive dev you can be. You can independently investigate an issue without stepping on each other, no need to hand-off control or deal with latency. Collaborate with shared focus only when you want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_find-out-more&quot; data-needslink=&quot;_find-out-more&quot;&gt;Find out more&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are excited to give you an early glimpse into Live Share today. Although we are only sharing it as a demo today, we will be releasing a limited private preview soon. If you want to learn more and keep up with the project, you can sign up by clicking &lt;a href=&quot;https://aka.ms/vsls-signup&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Concise Electronics for Geeks (2010)</title>
<link>http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/</guid>
<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot; /&gt;&lt;title&gt;Concise electronics for geeks&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;2429.9366642626&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Copyright (C) 2010 by Michal Zalewski &amp;lt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:lcamtuf@coredump.cx&quot;&gt;lcamtuf@coredump.cx&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few primers on electronics on the Internet; sadly, almost all of the top hits resort to gross oversimplifications (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_analogy&quot;&gt;hydraulic analogies&lt;/a&gt;), or convenient omission, when covering subtle but incredibly important topics such as the real-world behavior of semiconductors. There are some exceptions - but they often suffer from another malady: regressions into mundane, academic rigor, complete with differential equations and complex number algebra in transient analysis - a trait that is highly unlikely to be accessible, or even useful, to hobbyists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this guide is to bridge this gap; it should give you an anatomically correct insight into the underlying physical phenomena needed to accurately understand the behavior of semiconductors, capacitors, or inductors - but should be far more readable and way shorter than a typical academic textbook. The target audience is people who want to meaningfully tinker with more complex electronic circuits, or perhaps understand how computers really work - but for whom getting there is not meant to be a full-time job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The physics of conduction &lt;a name=&quot;1&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#1&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you probably recall from your school years, the dated but still useful &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_model_of_the_atom&quot;&gt;Bohr model of the atom&lt;/a&gt; explains that atoms consist of a dense center (nucleus) with a variable number of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton&quot;&gt;protons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron&quot;&gt;neutrons&lt;/a&gt;. This center is surrounded by a distant cloud of small, elementary particles called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron&quot;&gt;electrons&lt;/a&gt; occupying a number of discrete energy states around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two most important forces governing the atomic structure are: the powerful but short-range &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_strong_force&quot;&gt;residual strong force&lt;/a&gt; that binds the protons and neutrons together; and a significantly weaker but far-reaching &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_force&quot;&gt;electromagnetic force&lt;/a&gt; that causes subatomic particles carrying elementary charges to create &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field&quot;&gt;electric fields&lt;/a&gt;, repelling similar charges, and attracting dissimilar ones. Charges traveling in relation to each other are also mutually subjected to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field&quot;&gt;magnetic fields&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protons have an inherent, elementary positive charge; electrons have an identical charge with the opposite sign; and both produce a gradually vanishing (but infinite) electric field around them. This field is customarily visualized by observing how it would affect a positive charge in its vicinity: field lines are shown to be radially emanating away from positive charges, or toward negatives ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutrons don't generate and do not respond to electric fields - but are affected by magnetic fields created by charges in motion; this is an artifact of their &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark&quot;&gt;quark&lt;/a&gt; makeup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The positive electric charge (Q) of &lt;code&gt;6.24 * 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/code&gt; protons is known as one &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb&quot;&gt;coulomb&lt;/a&gt; (C); you don't need to remember this number: its only significance is that it corresponds neatly to other SI units used to measure related physical phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electromagnetic force causes protons to attract electrons, and forces the captive electrons to orbit the nucleus; it also causes protons to repel each other - but this effect is easily overcome by the strong nuclear force that holds the center of the atom together. Given the opportunity, any sufficiently stable atomic nucleus will generally seek to accumulate a number of electrons matching the number of protons, in order to form an electrically neutral particle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strongly bound and heavy nuclei of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_isotope&quot;&gt;stable isotopes&lt;/a&gt; do not undergo any structural changes under everyday circumstances. The electrons occupying the energetic, outer (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_electron&quot;&gt;valence&lt;/a&gt;) orbitals of an atom are a very different story; they are usually attracted to the nucleus fairly weakly, and can engage in two rather interesting behaviors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;5.6341923318668&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;6.6811279826464&quot;&gt;Some valence electron configurations are energetically preferred over others, due to the complex proton-proton and electron-electron interactions and quantum probability distributions that affect the geometry of the nuclear electromagnetic field. Because of this, in favorable conditions, atoms may be willing to share some of their electrons with neighbors, forming electrically neutral &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule&quot;&gt;molecules&lt;/a&gt; held together by the electromagnetic force - and bringing us chemistry as we know it.
&lt;p&gt;Three primary types of intramolecular bonds are recognized, depending on the exact nature of this exchange: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covalent_bond&quot;&gt;covalent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_bond&quot;&gt;ionic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_bond&quot;&gt;metallic&lt;/a&gt;. This last category is of particular interest: shared valence electrons in metals are so weakly bound, that they enjoy largely unhindered mobility through the crystal lattice, and are seemingly not tied to any particular atom - forming what is called an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_electron_model&quot;&gt;electron gas&lt;/a&gt; distributed through the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4.5883233532934&quot;&gt;Certain atoms or molecules may be not particularly strongly opposed to acquiring some additional electrons, or losing some of their own, without firmly attaching to any other single molecule - gaining a net negative or positive electrical charge in the process. Such charged particles are known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion&quot;&gt;ions&lt;/a&gt; (anions and cations, respectively).
&lt;p&gt;Ion formation may be driven by certain chemical reactions, by the action of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvation&quot;&gt;polar solvents&lt;/a&gt; on some substances, by certain types of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization&quot;&gt;energetic collisions&lt;/a&gt; - or even by simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triboelectric_effect&quot;&gt;mechanical action&lt;/a&gt;: when materials of different affinity to electrons are brought into contact and then pulled apart, a significant charge imbalance may form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that with sufficient energy, almost any substance will eventually form free ions; that said, materials in which ions are not formed easily under normal operating conditions are known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulator_(electrical)&quot;&gt;insulators&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dissociated solutions or in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_%28physics%29&quot;&gt;plasma&lt;/a&gt;, ions themselves are fairly mobile, moving around in response to electric fields and other processes; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrochemistry&quot;&gt;electrochemistry&lt;/a&gt; studies these behaviors in great detail, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrochemical_cell&quot;&gt;batteries&lt;/a&gt; being one of the most important applications of this principle. In solids, however, ions typically do not enjoy appreciable mobility. Therefore, many materials where ions can form with ease are still non-conductive: their surfaces may accept localized charges easily, but these charges do not move from one point to another on their own. Such materials may be useful for energy storage, but are poorly suited for signal distribution and processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As hinted earlier, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal&quot;&gt;metals&lt;/a&gt; are a special case in the world of solids, however: their crystal lattice may be considered to consist of (still immobile) metal cations, surrounded by mostly-free-roaming electrons. These electrons are not really bound to any specific atom; and if any localized charge imbalance is created by depositing or removing electrons, this imbalance gets equalized through the conductor at a significant fraction of the speed of light. It is important to note that the electrons themselves don't move through the medium nearly as fast - in fact, their traverse speed in a metallic conductor is usually measured in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current#Drift_speed&quot;&gt;millimeters per second&lt;/a&gt;; think of pressure equalization in a fluid, instead. This effect in response to an externally applied, electromotive force (say, a chemical reaction that forcibly takes electrons from one place and shoves them elsewhere) is known as the flow of electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In solid-state conductors, negatively-charged electrons are the only real, mobile charge carriers. Their positive counterpart - the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron&quot;&gt;positron&lt;/a&gt; - is a form of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter&quot;&gt;antimatter&lt;/a&gt;, and is not commonly encountered on Earth (although it can certainly be spotted &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_production&quot;&gt;at times&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The curious case of semiconductors &lt;a name=&quot;2&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#2&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In metals, there is an abundance of mobile electrons in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_band_structure&quot;&gt;conduction energy band&lt;/a&gt; at any given time because there is no &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_gap&quot;&gt;energetic band gap&lt;/a&gt; between the valence and conduction bands - i.e., valence electrons already have the range of energies needed to move around in the material at will. Conversely, in insulators, there are no virtually no mobile charge carriers, because the band gap is large enough not to be casually crossed by valence electrons under normal operating conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor&quot;&gt;Semiconductors&lt;/a&gt; are a special, intermediate case: similar to insulators, they have a band gap - but the gap is small enough to allow electrons to be periodically &quot;knocked out&quot; of their usual orbit and into the mobile conduction band, simply due to the inherent thermal vibration of atoms in the crystal lattice. In absence of an external electric field, these electrons quickly return to their original positions, and the process repeats over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a sufficiently strong electric field is applied, the picture changes slightly: the temporarily liberated electrons will immediately dart off toward the more positive region (a direction said to go &quot;against&quot; the direction of the electric field) - leaving &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_hole&quot;&gt;holes&lt;/a&gt; in the valence bands of their original hosts. Nearby electrons closer to the more negative region are also subject to the same &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromotive_force&quot;&gt;electromotive force&lt;/a&gt;, and will be eager to jump into that energetically favorable hole, in leaving a new hole at their original location. Over time, this will seemingly cause holes to drift in the crystal lattice &quot;along&quot; the field. The process ends with the liberated electron arriving at one edge of the semiconductor, ready to continue its journey elsewhere should any opportunity present itself; and with the hole bubbling up toward the other end, willing to accept any externally donated electrons. This form of charge transfer permits conduction, albeit only to a very limited extent (only a limited number of excited charge carriers is available at any given time, and due to spontaneous recombination, their lifetime is short). Of course, poor conductivity is not a significant feat by itself - about the only interesting property of this material is that more electrons get knocked into the conduction band when the material is exposed to light (with photons impacting the surface and transferring their energy to it) - giving birth to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoresistor&quot;&gt;photoresistors&lt;/a&gt; and related light-sensitive electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation gets slightly more remarkable once the material is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_(semiconductors)&quot;&gt;doped&lt;/a&gt; with certain other, closely related atoms. In n-type semiconductors, the dopant is a substance eager to donate its own weakly bound electrons to plug holes - before the temporarily excited electrons rightfully belonging to the doped material have a chance to return to their original state. This creates an abundance of long-lived negative charge carriers in the conduction band, in a stable material that has no net electrical charge (every dopant cation is offset by a free electron). These electrons will happily drift against any externally applied electric field with little effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In p-type semiconductors, on the other hand, the dopants are quick to snatch and trap any excited electrons with more force than the atoms from which the electrons originally came from. This achieves the opposite effect: an abundance of long-lived holes that want to accept any externally supplied wandering electrons into their valence bands. In an external field, this sea of holes will allow other electrons to surf from one atom to another without too much work (although jumping between holes requires a bit more energy than just drifting in the conduction band).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the continuous availability of long-lived charge carriers, both of these materials are highly conductive - but by themselves, perhaps not particularly exciting. The really interesting bit is when a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-N_junction&quot;&gt;p-n junction&lt;/a&gt; is formed by bringing these two types of semiconductors into contact, however: initially, some of the idle electrons from the n-type material will enter the p-type semiconductor to recombine with nearby holes; and p-type semiconductor holes will seemingly &quot;propagate&quot; across the junction when some nearby, temporarily excited valence electrons from the n-type material are captured on the p-type side, leaving holes in their original locations. This leads to the formation of a thin &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depletion_layer&quot;&gt;depletion layer&lt;/a&gt;, with very few mobile charge carriers available (and therefore, with rather poor conductivity). The formation of this layer is a self-limiting effect, though: with no external supply of charges, the recombination leaves the dopant ions in the vicinity of the junction unpaired, and the resulting electrostatic field (positive on the n-type side, and negative on the p-type side) eventually becomes strong enough to capture and hold any wandering electrons and holes, and prevent them from getting across the junction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying an external field to the junction in the direction identical to this intrinsic field - a process called reverse biasing - only serves to pull charge carriers further away, and therefore widen the depletion layer; appreciable conduction will not occur under these circumstances, at least until the field is strong enough to trigger &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_breakdown&quot;&gt;avalanche breakdown&lt;/a&gt; or a similar phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forward biasing the junction, on the other hand, will push the remaining charge carriers on both sides toward the junction, overcoming the internal field. If an external supply of charges is maintained, this allows continuous and efficient hole-electron recombination in the junction area, and the flow of current: n-type semiconductor accepts electrons to offset unbalanced cation charges, and the p-type semiconductor gives them up and frees up holes to avoid developing an unbalanced negative charge of its own. As a bonus, recombination is sometimes accompanied by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LED&quot;&gt;photon emission&lt;/a&gt;, as excited conduction band electrons finally drop to a lower energy level after finding a spot in nearby valence shells, and then continue the ride hole-jumping in the valence band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This field-controlled, unidirectional conduction of semiconductor junctions is one of the more important discoveries in the history of electronics - allowing a large number of solid-state &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_element&quot;&gt;nonlinear&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_component&quot;&gt;active&lt;/a&gt; components to be built; we will discuss them in more detail later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Core concepts in electrical circuits &lt;a name=&quot;3&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#3&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Current (I) &lt;a name=&quot;4&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#4&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current&quot;&gt;Current&lt;/a&gt; is the measure of the flow of electric charges through a selected section of the circuit. The unit of current - &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere&quot;&gt;ampere&lt;/a&gt; (A) - is one of the base SI units, defined as the flow of some &lt;code&gt;6.24 * 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/code&gt; elementary charges (1 coulomb) per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flow of current is the mechanism by which electrical circuits can perform &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_%28physics%29&quot;&gt;useful work&lt;/a&gt;. Naturally, unbalanced charges deposited in a variety of materials may generate electromagnetic fields even when no current is actively flowing, and these fields may in turn affect nearby objects, change the distribution of other charges in conductors, or control the behavior of semiconductor junctions; that said, depositing these charges in the first place requires the flow of current.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current through a conductor is generally expressed as a non-negative, absolute value, no matter which way it is flowing. The direction of the flow - for historical reasons, marked in the direction &lt;u&gt;opposite&lt;/u&gt; to the actual direction of electron travel, i.e. from a positive pole of the supply to the negative one - is usually conveyed when describing the voltage instead (see later on).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rudimentary &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammeter&quot;&gt;ammeters&lt;/a&gt; can be designed to measure currents by detecting the magnetic field generated by charges in motion, for example by placing a permanent magnet on a spring near a coiled conductor; ideal ammeters would not impede the flow of current in any way, although in practice, some power is always dissipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Resistance (R) &lt;a name=&quot;5&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#5&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;5&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance&quot;&gt;Resistance&lt;/a&gt; is the measure of opposition to the &lt;u&gt;steady&lt;/u&gt; flow of an electric current. With the exception of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductor&quot;&gt;superconductors&lt;/a&gt;, all conductive materials impede the flow of electrons to some extent - generally through a linear, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-invariant&quot;&gt;time-invariant&lt;/a&gt; effect comparable to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_%28physics%29&quot;&gt;aerodynamic drag&lt;/a&gt;; the energy wasted to overcome the drag excites the medium, and is eventually dissipated as heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit of resistance - &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm&quot;&gt;ohm&lt;/a&gt; (Ω) - is a derived SI unit, defined as the resistance of a conductor that, when subjected to a steady current of one ampere, dissipates one &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt&quot;&gt;watt&lt;/a&gt; (W) of heat - that's one &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule&quot;&gt;joule&lt;/a&gt; (J) per every coulomb of charge moved around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any uniform metallic conductor, the resistance is roughly equal to its length, times material-specific resistivity constant, divided by the cross-section of said conductor; some temperature dependency is also present. In practical circuits, conductors are generally selected so that the effects of their resistance are negligible; a specialized class of components, known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor&quot;&gt;resistors&lt;/a&gt;, is used to introduce predictable, linear resistance into the circuit, instead. Resistors with a very significant temperature dependency are known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermistor&quot;&gt;thermistors&lt;/a&gt;, but are used rarely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some materials may impede the flow of currents in a time-dependent manner, usually associated with the creation of magnetic or electric fields; this effect is &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; considered to be resistance, and is studied separately. Other materials may exhibit resistance patterns that are time-invariant, but vary in relation to some other parameter (e.g., in semiconductor junctions that respond to the magnitude and direction of external electromotive forces); this effect is still resistance, but such devices are not called resistors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Voltage (V) &lt;a name=&quot;6&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#6&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;6&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage&quot;&gt;Voltage&lt;/a&gt; across any two points in the circuit has several definitions, but most intuitively, can be understood as the measure of an electromotive force that would drive a current through a hypothetical conductor connected across these two points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This force does not depend merely on the difference in the number of accumulated elementary charges - but also on the &quot;pressure&quot; these charges are under to leave their current spots, due to the influence of resulting electric and magnetic fields. As a simple illustration, consider depositing 100 electrons on two conductive, reasonably distant plates - one of them large, and one small. Electrons deposited on the smaller plate will be packed more densely, and therefore, electric repulsion between them will be far more violent than in the other material. When the two elements are bridged with a conductive path, some current will briefly flow as charge densities (and not counts) equalize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit of voltage - &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt&quot;&gt;volt&lt;/a&gt; (V) - is a derived SI unit defined as the amount of electromotive force needed to induce the current of one ampere across a conductor with the resistance of one ohm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any electrical circuit, voltage measurements are meaningful only if relative to a clearly defined reference point; many &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current&quot;&gt;direct current&lt;/a&gt; circuits use a common rail connected to the negative pole of a two-pole battery as a &quot;ground&quot;, customarily defined as 0 volts - in which case, all measurements are implicitly understood to relate to this point. That said, the voltage between this rail and any other external, insulated object is essentially undefined: one man's 0V may be somebody else's -20,000V, even if simply due to electrostatic &lt;a href=&quot;http://abstrusegoose.com/strips/today_we_celebrate_our_INDEPENDENCE_DAY.PNG&quot;&gt;charge buildup&lt;/a&gt;. A well-designed physical connection to soil may provide a common 0V reference, but this comes with its own perils, and therefore, is used only when absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In almost all signal-processing circuits, useful information is encoded using changing voltage levels, rather than current magnitudes; exceptions happen, but are fairly rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifying steady voltages is not rocket science. but some ambiguity exists when it comes to constantly changing voltages in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current&quot;&gt;alternating current&lt;/a&gt; circuits, where the direction of current flow periodically reverses. In these settings, three different values may be used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Peak voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;peak&lt;/sub&gt;): measures voltage amplitude of the waveform in reference to its center point. This approach is commonly employed when dealing with small-signal AC circuits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peak-to-peak voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;p-p&lt;/sub&gt;): measures voltage difference between the lowest and highest voltage observed in the waveform (equal to &lt;code&gt;2 * V&lt;sub&gt;peak&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;). This is conceptually similar to how signal voltage is measured in DC circuits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square&quot;&gt;Root mean square&lt;/a&gt; voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;RMS&lt;/sub&gt;): uses the value of an equivalent DC voltage that would deliver the same power to the load (about &lt;code&gt;0.71 * V&lt;sub&gt;peak&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave&quot;&gt;sine wave&lt;/a&gt; currents). This approach is particularly common in electrical power distribution calculations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This graph demonstrates the difference more succinctly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/v_measurement.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always be aware which measurement method is being used; for example, &quot;110V&quot; AC mains voltage is actually given as RMS; this means that the actual sine wave swing is 154V, and peak-to-peak voltage is close to 310V (ouch!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ohm's law &lt;a name=&quot;7&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#7&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;7&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law&quot;&gt;Ohm's law&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most important rules describing the behavior of electrical circuits by formalizing the relationship between currents, voltages, and resistances - and a pretty straightforward one, too. The law states that the steady current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage applied to it, and inversely proportional to its resistance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;I = V/R&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same equation tells us that the voltage measured across a conductor must be equal to the steady current applied to it, times resistance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;V = IR&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lastly, that the resistance of a conductor can be derived from the observed current and the voltage across its terminals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;R = V/I&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This law is what makes resistors such useful components: they can be used to limit the current flowing through parts of the circuit to a specific, desired value; or, by creating voltage differences across resistor terminals, to create lower voltages for a variety of purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohm's law also makes it easy to turn ammeters into &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltmeter&quot;&gt;voltmeters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohmmeter&quot;&gt;ohmmeters&lt;/a&gt;. Voltmeters can simply measure the very low current flowing through when a large resistor of known value is placed across the test points (this resistor needs to be large enough not to disrupt the circuit in an appreciable way) - and then compute the voltage according to the &lt;code&gt;V = IR&lt;/code&gt; rule; ohmmeters may be constructed by applying a known voltage to an unknown resistive load, measuring the resulting current, and then solving the equation for R.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Joule's law &lt;a name=&quot;8&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#8&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;8&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power (P) is a measure of the rate at which work is performed, or at which energy is converted into another form. In electrical circuits, a form of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule%27s_law&quot;&gt;Joule's law&lt;/a&gt; gives us the following formula:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;P = IV&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...where &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; is the current through a component, and &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt; is the observed voltage drop. This relationship is actually intuitive: if there is no current flowing, obviously no useful work is being done by a circuit; and if no voltage drop occurs, all the current must be passed as-is, rather than utilized in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrical energy may be dissipated as heat or radiation, converted to motion, stored in electromagnetic fields, in electrochemical reactions, and so forth; in all cases, the equation gives you an accurate picture of the sum of all the processes at work, based on the observed or predicted voltage and current alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heat dissipation is of particular interest in electronics, as it must be kept in check to avoid destroying resistive loads. By combining Joule's law and Ohm's law, it can be shown that the heat dissipated by a resistor is given by any of these two equations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;P = I²R&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;P = V²/R&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is pretty useful: you can use these rules to show that it's impossible to exceed the power rating of a 1/4 watt, 150 Ω resistor working in a 5V circuit; and that a 15 Ω resistor will light up the night sky in that same setting, unless the current through it is limited by other means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Intermission: working with decibels &lt;a name=&quot;9&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#9&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;9&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In component datasheets and some calculations, engineers often opt to express the ratio between power quantities in terms of a somewhat arbitrary but convenient logarithmic measure - &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel&quot;&gt;decibels&lt;/a&gt; (dB):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;dB&lt;/sub&gt; = 10 * log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; / P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a 25% increase in the power of an acoustic wave is equal to about +1.0 dB; a two-fold increase will be equal to about +3 dB; and a 100-fold increase will be +20 dB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In electronics, it is usually more desirable to compare voltages and signal amplitudes, rather than to directly measure power. Since the relation between voltage and power is usually quadratic - in these uses, decibels are calculated using a slightly different formula:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;dB&lt;/sub&gt; = 10 * log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;² / V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;²) = 20 * log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; / V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, a 50% increase in voltage is +1.0 dB, a two-fold increase is about +6 dB, and so forth. There is nothing profoundly significant about decibels, but they will crop up every now and then - so it's best to get this over with right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time-dependent currents &lt;a name=&quot;10&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#10&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;10&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some types of linear electronic components may exhibit time-dependent (and therefore, signal frequency dependent) current characteristics. This pattern is generally associated with the (reversible) storage of some of the supplied energy, most commonly in the form of electromagnetic fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Capacitance (C) &lt;a name=&quot;11&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#11&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;11&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When two conductive plates are brought close to each other, it becomes unusually easy to store opposing electrostatic charges on them: the strong electromagnetic field caused by electrons drawn away from one of the plates will be largely offset by a symmetrical field caused by charges pushed onto the other plate. The closer the plates are together, the larger surface area they have, and the better the medium between them is at guiding and amplifying the resulting electric field (due to the field-induced alignment of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole&quot;&gt;dipoles&lt;/a&gt;) - the greater number of elementary charges can be deposited on one end, and removed on the other, before the electromotive force opposing this process becomes as strong as the voltage driving it. Note that this works only if the charge transfer is symmetrical, though: if charge carriers are not efficiently removed from one of the plates, they can't be efficiently added on the other one, not without having to fight a much stronger, unbalanced electric field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitance&quot;&gt;Capacitance&lt;/a&gt; is the measure of this phenomenon: the ratio of the number of charges deposited (in coloumbs), versus the electromotive force needed to deposit them (in volts):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;C = Q/V&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to look at it is that one &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farad&quot;&gt;farad&lt;/a&gt; (F) - the unit of capacitance - corresponds to the steady current of one ampere being supplied for one second, and resulting in one volt potential difference forming across the plates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;C = I*t/V&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most electronic components are designed to keep their inherent capacitance at a negligible level; some parasitic capacitance may develop between parallel wires or circuit board traces, but this is a concern only in certain specialized applications. Intentional capacitances are usually introduced where needed with dedicated components - &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor&quot;&gt;capacitors&lt;/a&gt;; these devices usually consist of two long ribbons of a metallic conductor, separated by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_medium&quot;&gt;dielectric&lt;/a&gt; film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting property of capacitors is that when subjected to a constant external voltage, they initially allow the flow of current - even though electrons do not actually pass through the gap, they can perform useful work in other parts of the circuit on their way onto, or away from, the plates. This current will gradually drop to zero as the voltage across the plates approaches the supply voltage, though - and eventually, all apparent conduction will cease:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/cap-charging.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the capacitor is then disconnected from the charging source, it will retain the charge imbalance (in theory, indefinitely); the stored charges will create a transient current as soon as a conductive path is created across the capacitor terminals, a process that will return the stored energy, and return the capacitor to its discharged state. The speed at which this happens is given by a differential equation, but it's usually sufficient to know the following (R is resistance through which the device is charged or discharged):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;t = 1/3RC → I = 75%, V = 25%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;t = 1/2RC → I = 60%, V = 40%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;t = 2/3RC → I = 52%, V = 48%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;t = 1RC → I = 37%, V = 63%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;t = 2RC → I = 14%, V = 86%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;t = 3RC → I = 5%, V = 95%&lt;/code&gt; - practically fully charged&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;t = 4RC → I = 2%, V = 98%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;t = 5RC → I = 0.7%, V = 99.3%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capacitors often serve as a simple energy-storage device - but their other interesting property is that while they largely block conduction for low-frequency currents (spare for the brief time when they are getting charged), they allow apparent conduction at higher frequencies: if the current is reversed before the charging is complete, there is a continuous reciprocating motion of charges through the surrounding circuit. This effect is capacitance-, current-, frequency-, and waveform-dependent - but in essence, any given capacitor charged and discharged with a well-controlled alternating current acts as a simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-pass_filter&quot;&gt;high-pass filter&lt;/a&gt;; average current through one particular capacitor in function of the frequency of the driving sine wave is shown in this graph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/cap-highpass.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will discuss frequency filters in more detail later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Inductance (L) &lt;a name=&quot;12&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#12&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;12&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, charged particles tend to interact with other particles moving in relation to them. On a macroscopic scale, this manifests itself as a magnetic force between materials with aligned electron spins; and more interestingly, as an electromotive force experienced by conductors subjected to magnetic field gradients in space or in time. In essence, any varying magnetic field, perhaps created by a varying current in a conductor or by moving a permanent magnet around, may induce transient voltage in any other conductor subjected to this influence; this process is the subject of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday's_law_of_induction&quot;&gt;Faraday's law of induction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductor&quot;&gt;Inductors&lt;/a&gt; are a class of devices consisting of conductors arranged to create strong, coherent magnetic fields; these fields will then induce voltages in the conductor in response to changing currents, resisting these changes - a sort of an inertial effect. When connected to a supply, such a component begins in a non-conductive state, and then gradually ramps up current as the field becomes saturated. Later, when the supply is cut off, the energy of the collapsing magnetic field is returned into the circuit, sustaining the flow of current for a brief while (or, if this is not possible, causing a substantial, if very short-lived, voltage to build up before all the energy is dissipated internally).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit of inductance - one &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_%28unit%29&quot;&gt;henry&lt;/a&gt; - is defined as the behavior of a conductor that, when subjected to a linear change of current by one ampere per second, opposes the change by developing a voltage of one volt across its terminals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;L = V*t/I&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like with capacitors, determining the voltage and current through its terminals at any given time requires solving a differential equation; but this table is often good enough:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;t = 1/3L/R → I = 25%, V = 75%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;t = 1/2L/R → I = 40%, V = 60%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;t = 2/3L/R → I = 48%, V = 52%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;t = 1L/R → I = 63%, V = 37%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;t = 2L/R → I = 86%, V = 14%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;t = 3L/R → I = 95%, V = 5%&lt;/code&gt; - practically fully conducting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;t = 4L/R → I = 98%, V = 2%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;t = 5L/R → I = 99.3%, V = 0.7%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the relation of the definition of inductance to that of capacitance; and the relationship between the time characteristics. Inductors behave in a manner conceptually opposite to capacitors, permitting low-frequency or static currents to flow almost freely (after a brief ramp-up period), but creating a significant, current-dependent voltage drop at high frequencies (a low-pass filter), as all the energy is constantly consumed on reversing the magnetic field. Combining the two in clever ways is also a convenient way to build oscillators; more about this soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reactance (X) and impedance (Z) &lt;a name=&quot;13&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#13&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;13&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_reactance&quot;&gt;Reactance&lt;/a&gt; is a parameter describing the &lt;em&gt;apparent&lt;/em&gt; resistance caused by capacitive and inductive behaviors. For sine wave alternating currents of a given frequency (f), reactance can be computed as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = -1 / (2πfC)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = 2πfL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt; = X&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; + X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to underscore that these equations apply &lt;u&gt;only&lt;/u&gt; to steady, symmetrical, sine wave alternating currents, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactance and resistance are distinct phenomena, with the former being associated with reversible energy storage, and the latter, with one-way losses; mixing them up is usually not desirable - but neither is considering them completely separate; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance&quot;&gt;impedance&lt;/a&gt; is a convenient way to analyze resistance and reactance together in the form of a complex number (&lt;code&gt;j = √-1&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Z = R + j*X&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex impedance can be used in place of resistance to extend Ohm's law and many other fundamental principles in electronics; but in many cases, its meaning is more prosaic: when the behavior of a circuit is dominated by one of the characteristics (e.g., just resistance), &quot;impedance&quot; may be just a shorthand for that particular property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Basic electronic components &lt;a name=&quot;14&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#14&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;14&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section gives a basic overview of common, discrete components used in electronic circuits, along with their schematic representations. Some of them may have multiple symbols due to random differences between the United States and the rest of the world; in such cases, you should almost certainly memorize all variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Voltage supplies &lt;a name=&quot;15&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#15&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;15&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideal voltage sources maintain a constant voltage across their terminals (or a constant voltage amplitude, in case of AC circuits), regardless of the current flowing through a connected load. In real life, the behavior of voltage sources is approximated to some extent by a variety of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_supply&quot;&gt;power supplies&lt;/a&gt;, including batteries - but with two caveats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only a finite current can be supplied; once the source-specific maximum is reached, the device may reduce output voltage, shut down, or simply catch fire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some dependency between the supplied current and observed terminal voltage is commonly seen. This dependency may be nearly linear in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linear.com/pc/images/product/fullsize/111567_1.jpg&quot;&gt;unregulated sources&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_bcej-id-XqQ/THF35jTHKeI/AAAAAAAAAu4/Nf9eVvKO3a4/s400/battIV.gif&quot;&gt;batteries&lt;/a&gt;; or steeply non-linear in &lt;a href=&quot;http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mwidholm/nanosat/IVhi.gif&quot;&gt;solar cells&lt;/a&gt; and regulated supplies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the supplies used in electronic circuits are between 3 and 12V, and can supply between 100 mA and several amps. Typical schematic symbols include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/voltage.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The behavior of non-ideal voltage sources is sometimes coarsely accounted for by defining the hypothetical internal impedance of the supply - a resistor that, when introduced in series with an ideal voltage supply, would produce a similar current-dependent voltage drop. This model is seldom perfect, but can be a useful analytic tool. For example, one of the important rules in circuit design is that high impedance (low current capacity) signal sources should not be driving low impedance (power-hungry) loads, to prevent overloading the source and distorting the input signal; this also applies to voltage supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Current sources &lt;a name=&quot;16&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#16&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;16&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pure current sources are expected to maintain a constant current flowing through the connected load, by adjusting the force driving it - that is, the voltage - as necessary. This implies that open-circuit voltages should rise with no upper bound, until the force is significant enough to create a conductive path through free space; that may require thousands or millions of volts in everyday cases, and therefore, is not a very realistic scenario. Real-world current supplies usually have a modest maximum voltage they can produce in an effort to maintain a particular rate of charge flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of sources are not commonly encountered in nature, but constructing them from active components is useful in certain cases (for example, for charging capacitors at a linear rate). Their standard symbol is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/current.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This symbols is rarely seen, though - current supplies are usually integral to the circuit that needs them, with the circuit itself driven by a voltage source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Common passive components &lt;a name=&quot;17&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#17&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;17&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passive components are named so for their inability to amplify signals; this is in contrast with devices such as the now largely obsolete &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube&quot;&gt;vacuum tubes&lt;/a&gt;, or their contemporary successors - &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor&quot;&gt;transistors&lt;/a&gt;. The boundaries of this subset are somewhat fuzzy, to be sure - power supplies, optoelectronics, and electromechanical components are commonly excluded, for example; so tend to be all semiconductors, even though some of them are not meant to be amplifiers. In any case, some of the uncontested passive elements commonly used in low-voltage electronic circuits include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resistors:&lt;/strong&gt; most of the general-purpose resistors consist of nickel-chromium metal films, and are manufactured with a power rating of 0.125 or 0.25W, accuracy of 5% or 1%, and a temperature dependence under 0.01% per kelvin (thermistors are designed with a much higher temperature coefficient); different tolerances, power ratings, and designs are available at a premium, but seldom necessary. It's definitely better to stock a full range of common resistances using the lowest-cost resistors (around $0.02 a piece), rather than cherry-pick more expensive ones for every individual circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard (&quot;preferred&quot;) values are selected to make most sense given the expected tolerances, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.logwell.com/tech/components/resistor_values.html&quot;&gt;E6 scale&lt;/a&gt; being used most commonly. These values are usually encoded using &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_color_code&quot;&gt;color codes&lt;/a&gt; on through-hole resistors, or as a two-digit value and a single-digit exponent on surface mount devices (e.g., &quot;473&quot; means 47 * 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Ω, or 47 kΩ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In schematics, the ohm symbol is often omitted - or sometimes substituted with the letter &quot;R&quot; if no unit prefix is present. For example, 1 kΩ may become &quot;1k&quot;, while 100 Ω may become &quot;100&quot; or &quot;100R&quot;. To further shorten the notation, &quot;R&quot; or the unit prefix is moved in place of the decimal dot - e.g., 1.2 kΩ may be written as &quot;1k2&quot;. Commonly used resistances span from 1 Ω to 10 MΩ; stocking anything outside these limits is probably not very useful in everyday work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual resistor symbols are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/resistor.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capacitors:&lt;/strong&gt; low-cost, general-purpose capacitors use ceramics, polyester, or metal oxides as a dielectric; and aluminum, tantalum, or an electrolyte solution to form the plates themselves; other compositions are available where extreme stability or high voltage capability are required, but tend to be more expensive - and again, make sense only in specialized applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrolytic capacitors enjoy some of the highest capacitances in proportion to their cost and size - but need to be polarized, work well only for fairly low voltages, have some leakage current, and tend to exhibit non-trivial resistance (denoted as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalent_series_resistance&quot;&gt;ESR&lt;/a&gt;, and limiting their ability to deal with high-frequency signals); so avoiding electrolytics as long as possible is generally a good idea (cheap multi-layer ceramic capacitors - MLCC - are available up to at least 10 µF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commonly used capacitances span from 1 pF to 1 mF in everyday applications, and go up to several hundred farads for supercapacitors used in energy storage. When shopping, keep in mind that in some markets, unit prefixes &quot;nano&quot; and &quot;milli&quot; are not used when indicating capacitance; it's a silly practice - 47 nF is more readable than 0.047 µF or 47,000 pF - but you may have to live with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small capacitors use the same three-digit exponential notation as used for resistors (and similar preferred values) to express capacitance in picofarads (e.g., &quot;224&quot; = 22 * 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; pF = 220 nF); larger capacitors usually display the capacitance and unit prefix as-is. The following symbols are used for capacitors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/capacitor.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inductors:&lt;/strong&gt; constructed by making a coil out of a piece of a very long but low-resistance wire, so that the concentric magnetic field lines around the conductor add up inside the coil to form a powerful, coherent field (&lt;a href=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Basic_Inductor_with_B-field.svg/400px-Basic_Inductor_with_B-field.svg.png&quot;&gt;image&lt;/a&gt;). Because of the length of the wire needed, many small inductors will have a noticeable resistance - usually between 0.5 and 20 Ω.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common inductor values in electronic circuits range from 1 µH to 470 mH or so. The usual symbol of an inductor is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/inductor.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer&quot;&gt;Transformers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; constructed by pairing two inductors, typically wrapped around a common ferromagnetic core that guides and contains the electromagnetic field to improve performance. The interesting property of this arrangement is that changes in the current flowing through one of the inductors will generate a back electromotive force in the other, coupled coil. Coil turn ratio determines the ratio between the driving and the induced voltage, making transformers extremely useful for converting voltages (the law of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy&quot;&gt;conservation of energy&lt;/a&gt; ensures that transformers are not a free energy scheme: the power (V*I) must remain the same, and every increase in voltage reduces current capability proportionately). Another common use is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanic_isolation&quot;&gt;galvanically isolating&lt;/a&gt; circuits for safety reasons - i.e., only magnetic coupling, but no direct charge flow pathways, would be maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their primary caveat is that they do not exhibit their trademark behavior when fed steady DC signals (once the core is saturated and peak magnetic field is attained, a significant winding current is admitted and largely goes to waste); and that optimum efficiency (often 95%+) is generally maintained over a fairly narrow range of AC frequencies (depending on the construction of the transformer). Low-frequency transformers, such as the ones used for 50-60 Hz mains signals, need large and heavy, slowly saturating cores; while high-frequency transformers can be much smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual symbol is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/transformer.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, windings may have multiple taps, or additional windings can be provided as a feedback mechanism for building high voltage &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyback_transformer&quot;&gt;flyback transformers&lt;/a&gt; that exploit resonant frequencies of the ferrite core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Electromechanical and optoelectronic devices &lt;a name=&quot;18&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#18&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;18&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a multitude of components that allow electronic circuits to interface with the outside world - from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyroelectricity&quot;&gt;heat&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geiger-Mueller_tube&quot;&gt;radiation&lt;/a&gt; detectors, to various &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_fluorescent_display&quot;&gt;exotic display technologies&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_effect#Peltier_effect&quot;&gt;thermal transfer devices&lt;/a&gt;. Listing them all is a futile task - but here's an overview of some of the most common components you may encounter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switches:&lt;/strong&gt; one of the most rudimentary electromechanical devices, switches interrupt and close circuits in response to an externally applied force. These devices come in a wide variety of designs (rotary, paddle / toggle, rocker, pushbutton, slide, etc), and an even greater variety of sizes. Other than the power rating, their most important parameters are the number of actual switch positions, the number of &quot;throws&quot; (signal outputs the switch can alternate between - this must obviously be equal or smaller than the number of positions allowed), the number of &quot;poles&quot; (separate switching pathways put in a single package), and the type of switching action (sustained / latching or momentary; with momentary switches further divided between normally closed or normally open designs - &quot;NC&quot; and &quot;NO&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symbol for a single pole, single throw switch is shown on the left; a momentary, normally open switch is in the middle; and a single pole double throw is shown on the right:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/switch.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanical switches may also be operated by magnetic fields (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_switch&quot;&gt;Reed switch&lt;/a&gt;), gravity (mercury and ball-type &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt_switch&quot;&gt;tilt switches&lt;/a&gt;), liquid levels (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Float_switch&quot;&gt;float switches&lt;/a&gt;), and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple actuators - &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnet&quot;&gt;electromagnets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudspeaker&quot;&gt;speakers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solenoid&quot;&gt;solenoids&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relays&quot;&gt;relays&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: as noted previously, electric currents flowing through properly oriented wires can induce strong, coherent magnetic fields; these magnetic fields may, in turn, interact with materials where electron spins are coherently aligned: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet&quot;&gt;permanent magnets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferromagnetism&quot;&gt;ferromagnetic&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramagnetism&quot;&gt;paramagnetic&lt;/a&gt; metals. An inductor designed with this in mind is called an electromagnet; the three most basic uses of electromagnets are speakers (where a diaphragm is being moved back and forth to create audible sound waves), solenoids (pushing or pulling a plunger - e.g., in car door locks or valves), and relays (mechanical switches operated by an electromagnet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generic electromagnets and solenoids are usually drawn as inductors, and merely annotated to indicate their intended function. The symbol of a loudspeaker is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/speaker.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and for relays, we tend to use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/relay.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amusingly, relays and solenoids can be used as crude speakers when driven by audio-frequency signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor&quot;&gt;Motors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_generator&quot;&gt;generators&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; motors exploit the interaction of electromagnets and magnetic materials to put their output shaft in continuous rotary motion. This can be achieved by driving the coils directly with alternating sine wave currents (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_motor&quot;&gt;synchronous motors&lt;/a&gt;), by providing carefully timed voltage pulses (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushless_motor&quot;&gt;brushless&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepper_motor&quot;&gt;stepper motors&lt;/a&gt;), or with steady direct currents, mechanically switched by commutators (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushed_motor&quot;&gt;brushed motors&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This operating principle is reversible: when rotated by an external force, motors serve as generators, producing a voltage across their terminals. A striking demonstration of this is connecting the terminals of two similar, brushed DC motors together: rotating one of them will induce a voltage sufficient to turn the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The symbols used for motors are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/motor.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piezoelectricity&quot;&gt;Piezoelectric&lt;/a&gt; crystals:&lt;/strong&gt; certain materials tend to generate voltages in response to mechanical strain, and vice versa - contract or expand in response to applied fields or the currents flowing through them; in some settings, this action may in turn affect the applied voltage or admitted current, resulting in oscillating action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These principles are used in a number of piezoelectric devices, the most common of which are &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_oscillator&quot;&gt;crystal oscillators&lt;/a&gt; - where the crystal vibrates at a resonant frequency when subjected to an external current, similar to some capacitor-inductor arrangements we will discuss later on. Other applications use exotic, precision &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piezoelectric_motor&quot;&gt;motors / actuators&lt;/a&gt;, piezoelectric transducers used to sense or generate soundwaves, pressure sensors, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual symbol of a crystal oscillator is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/oscillator.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiometer&quot;&gt;Potentiometers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; manually adjustable resistors; can be constructed by placing a conductive wiper across a resistive substrate. Available as miniature board-mounted &quot;trim pots&quot; that need to be operated with a screwdriver, and are meant to be adjusted at assembly or servicing time; larger panel-mount devices with a knob or a slider used for interfacing with users; more expensive but precise multi-turn units of both flavors; and potentiometer-based position-, deflection-, or pressure-sensing components that provide the circuit with feedback about the position of monitored mechanical assemblies. In all cases, the usual symbol is something close to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/potentiometer.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potentiometers are usually not meant to conduct significant currents (and dissipate the resulting heat); therefore, using them requires some care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trimmer caps:&lt;/strong&gt; manually adjustable capacitors; available only for small capacitances, usually controlled by gradually moving capacitor plates apart when a knob or a screw is rotated. Panel-mount devices were once very popular in radio frequency circuits to control the frequency of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterodyne&quot;&gt;heterodyne receivers&lt;/a&gt; - but are now largely displaced by digital frequency generation that can be controlled with mechanically simpler input devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The symbol is analogous to that of a potentiometer - except that the &quot;wiper&quot; is not actually a terminal of the device:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/variable_cap.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb&quot;&gt;Incandescent lamps&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; simple, well-known components that exploit the heat-driven light emission of a resistive metal wire placed under vacuum or in a low-pressure, inert gas (to prevent oxidation and minimize convection-based heat transfer). As the wire heats up, its resistance tends to rise - resulting in a self-limiting current flow that prevents the device from overheating and being destroyed within the (usually very generous) range of voltages it is designed for. Their primary downside is that they radiate most of their energy in the infrared range, which is not very desirable; and that they are slow to turn on and switch off, making them unsuitable for optical data signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lightbulbs are fairly unremarkable electrically, other than their interesting non-linear current characteristics: while the wire is cold, a significant current can flow, but only for a limited time. This sometimes results in non-conventional uses of lightbulbs in high-quality sine wave oscillators, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien_bridge_oscillator&quot;&gt;Wien bridge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incandescent lamp symbols:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/lightbulb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LED&quot;&gt;Light-emitting diodes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; certain types of semiconductor p-n junctions tend to emit light as electrons and holes recombine; LEDs are designed to exploit this phenomenon, instead of making use of the electrical characteristics of the junction itself. Unlike incandescent light bulbs, LEDs dissipate most of the energy as light, not heat - spare for some resistive losses in the semiconductor itself; and can be started and stopped very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These devices are more difficult to operate than lightbulbs, because they are very sensitive to the applied voltage - it must be enough to overcome the junction bias, but will result in a destructive current if off by as little as 0.2V. This is because diodes are only weakly conductive up until the potential of the junction is overcome - and shortly past that point, begin conducting like crazy. Current-limiting resistors or constant current supplies are commonly employed to prevent trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junction voltage drop is commonly in the 1.1 - 1.4V range for infrared diodes, 1.6 - 2.0V for red LEDs, 2.0 - 2.3V for yellow and orange, 2.2 - 2.8V for green, and 3.2 - 3.8V for blue, violet, white, and UV diodes. Commodity indicator LEDs are designed for currents between 5 and 30 mA. These parameters will vary from one device to another, and should always be confirmed with the datasheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all other aspects, LEDs behave very much like a regular semiconductor diode, discussed in the next section. Their symbol is (arrow pointing in the direction of current flow - toward the negative pole of the supply):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/led.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light sensors - &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaic_cell&quot;&gt;photovoltaic cells&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoresistor&quot;&gt;photoresistors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodiode&quot;&gt;photodiodes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; three additional uses of semiconductor materials where we don't really care about their electrical characteristics as such. Photovoltaic cells rely on a p-n junction to generate free charge carriers in response to photon excitation, and also to separate charges - so that an electromotive force is created across their terminals, forming a voltage source. Photodiodes work in a very similar way, but are used with an external voltage to achieve a current dependent on the amount of light shining on a reverse-biased junction. Finally, photoresistors are monolithic semiconductors where a higher number of photon-induced charge carriers promotes conduction; compared to photodiodes, they are much slower, but have other favorable characteristics, such as a very broad sensitivity range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their respective symbols:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/photosensitive.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone&quot;&gt;Microphones&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; a variety of sound-sensitive devices (generally variable resistors, capacitors, or electromagnets) used to sample audio signals. The most common variety today are &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electret_microphone&quot;&gt;electret microphones&lt;/a&gt; that utilize an internal, permanently charged membrane to form an interesting type of a capacitor; but even a regular speaker and some vanilla capacitors exhibit some audio sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual symbol of a microphone is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fuses:&lt;/strong&gt; a variety of components designed to either irreversibly blow up (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuse_%28electrical%29&quot;&gt;traditional fuses&lt;/a&gt;), toggle a mechanical switch, or just temporarily stop conducting (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resettable_fuse&quot;&gt;PPTC fuses&lt;/a&gt;) when the current flowing through them exceeds the desired value. Fuses are meant to protect more expensive or harder-to-service components from being affected when something goes wrong (e.g., a stray metal item shorts traces on the circuit board); and to prevent the circuit from overheating and starting a fire if the problem goes uncorrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of fuses in low-voltage, low-power consumer electronics is often a matter of a judgment call; but if the power supply can source significant currents, enough to blow a hole in the circuit board, adding a fuse may be a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&quot;Proper&quot; discrete semiconductors &lt;a name=&quot;19&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#19&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;19&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diodes:&lt;/strong&gt; a simple p-n junction that begins conducting well, but only in one direction, when an internal junction voltage (usually somewhere around 0.6 - 0.7V) is exceeded. It will not conduct in the opposite direction unless a much higher breakdown voltage is applied (this figure commonly lies between 20 and 1000V, although diodes with much smaller breakdown voltages can be manufactured). Two special types of diodes can be seen in electronic circuits along the &quot;normal&quot; ones: fast, low-threshold &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schottky_diode&quot;&gt;Schottky diodes&lt;/a&gt; used for small signal switching (with junction threshold of merely 0.2 - 0.4V); and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zener_diode&quot;&gt;Zener diodes&lt;/a&gt; with very precisely defined reverse breakdown voltage, often used as voltage references or voltage-limiting &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_%28electrical%29&quot;&gt;shunts&lt;/a&gt; that protect sensitive components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current-voltage curve for a typical diode may look roughly like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/diode_iv.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past a certain forward or reverse voltage, any diode will happily attempt to conduct practically arbitrary currents. The interesting property of a diode (or any other p-n junction) is that while in this mode, the device will always maintain a potential close to that threshold voltage across its terminals: this electric field is necessary to keep the junction conductive, and the diode will develop an apparent resistance needed to maintain it. With higher currents, the measured voltage across the will increase subtly due to the resistance of the semiconductor material itself - but in most cases, this effect is not very pronounced (some Schottky diodes are an exception).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The symbol of a diode is an arrow pointing in the direction of current flow during forward-biased operation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/diode.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people use separate symbols for Zener (&lt;a href=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Zener_diode_symbol.svg/200px-Zener_diode_symbol.svg.png&quot;&gt;image&lt;/a&gt;) and Schottky (&lt;a href=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Schottky_diode_symbol.svg/200px-Schottky_diode_symbol.svg.png&quot;&gt;image&lt;/a&gt;) diodes, but you should certainly not bank on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the most common general-purpose diodes are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/1N4148_1N4448.pdf&quot;&gt;1N4148&lt;/a&gt; (rated for 1 A, 100V reverse voltage) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fairchildsemi.com/ds/1N%2F1N4001.pdf&quot;&gt;1N400x series&lt;/a&gt; (1 A, assorted voltages from 50 to 1000V); &lt;a href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/www.datasheetcatalog.org/datasheet/vishay/85662.pdf&quot;&gt;BAT46&lt;/a&gt; is a popular Schottky diode rated for 100 mA, with a low-current voltage drop of merely 0.25V; while &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ing.unlp.edu.ar/electrotecnia/circelec/1N4738.pdf&quot;&gt;1N47xx&lt;/a&gt; is a family of popular Zener diodes with reverse breakdown voltages ranging from 3.3V to 200V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-effect_transistor&quot;&gt;Field-effect transistors&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; transistors are a very important class of semiconductor devices that, generally speaking, allow &quot;weak&quot; (low amplitude or high impedance) signals to control much greater currents flowing through the device - a sort of an electronically controlled potentiometer. They are primarily used as signal amplifiers, impedance converters, and digital switches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSFET&quot;&gt;MOSFETs&lt;/a&gt; - metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors - are perhaps the most intuitive, if recent, variety. Three-terminal, enhancement mode, n-channel MOSFETs (the most common type) consist of a nominally non-conductive n-p-n junction. One of the terminals - called &quot;drain&quot; (D) - is connected to one of the n-type regions; &quot;source&quot; (S) terminal is connected to the p-type and the other n-type region; and &quot;gate&quot; (G) is placed across the p-type substrate, isolated with a very thin layer of glass; interestingly, this layer of glass is so thin that it is easily destroyed by electrostatic discharge - requiring all MOSFETs to be handled with care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This arrangement of connections - shown below on the left - results in a normal p-n diode that allows conduction from source to drain - but no conduction the other way round; MOSFET transistors are operated with this junction reverse-biased - i.e., drain more positive than source in case of n-p-n devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting part is that the isolated gate-source pathway through the p-type semiconductor acts as a small capacitor: applying a voltage higher than the source to the gate region will deposit a positive charge on the terminal, which pushes aways holes in the p-type semiconductor - and pulls free electrons from n-type terminals in, forming a junction-free conduction path (shown on the right):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/mosfet_operation.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some minimal gate voltage needed to cause a sufficient charge separation; this threshold voltage - V&lt;sub&gt;GS(TH)&lt;/sub&gt; - depends on the geometry of the transistor, and generally ranges from 1 to 2V (but may be as high as 3-4V for high power devices).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MOSFET transistors allow very significant currents to be controlled by applying small, very high impedance signals to the gate terminal (there is virtually no gate-source current observed, and this &quot;capacitor&quot; retains the charge even after the source is disconnected); the resistance of the created conductive channel is proportional to the applied voltage, resulting in a transistor-specific two- or three-digit amplification factor (you shouldn't depend on its exact value, though).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other common types of field-effect transistors are p-channel MOSFETs, which use p-n-p junctions, and switch on with a gate voltage is &lt;u&gt;lower&lt;/u&gt; than the source voltage (and have slightly inferior electrical characteristics); four-terminal MOSFETs with no internal connection between the source and the middle semiconductor layer (the fourth terminal connected to this area is referred to as &quot;body&quot;), useful in some switching applications; less common depletion mode MOSFETs, which have a reversed operation, and are normally conductive until a field is applied to disrupt the channel; and somewhat simpler, depletion-only &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JFET&quot;&gt;JFETs&lt;/a&gt;, which do not feature a glass insulator, and exhibit higher &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transconductance&quot;&gt;transconductance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symbols for n-channel and p-channel enhancement MOSFETs, and their on-by-default depletion mode equivalents, are shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/mosfet.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting enhancement mode MOSFET transistors include &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fairchildsemi.com/ds/2N/2N7000.pdf&quot;&gt;2N7000&lt;/a&gt; (n-channel, 200 mA), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.onsemi.com/pub_link/Collateral/NTD4858N.PDF&quot;&gt;NTD4858N&lt;/a&gt; (n-channel, 73A), or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.st.com/stonline/books/pdf/docs/11236.pdf&quot;&gt;STP12PF06&lt;/a&gt; (p-channel, 12A).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_junction_transistor&quot;&gt;Bipolar junction transistors&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; BJTs are a bit more messy predecessor to FETs, allowing the current between their two terminals - &quot;collector&quot; (C) and &quot;emitter&quot; (E) - to be controlled by a smaller current flowing from the third terminal - &quot;base&quot; (B) - to the emitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BJTs consist of a nominally non-conductive junction, most commonly n-p-n - with the outer layers connected to the collector and emitter terminals, and a very thin p-type layer sandwiched in between connected to the base terminal (see image below, left).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In normal operation, collector is connected to a more positive region, and emitter is more negative; in this configuration, the B-C junction is reverse biased and does not conduct. When a small current between the base and the collector is applied, however, the B-E junction depletion layer collapses; and because of how thin the base layer is, the depletion layer on the B-C junction is also compromised. High-velocity electrons that are accelerated by the B-E voltage and inject from the emitter into the p-type semiconductor will easily make it to the collector layer - and a significant current will flow (a device-specific two- or three-digit current amplification will be seen, the exact value of which is - again - not to be relied upon):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/bjt_operation.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bipolar junction transistors with n-p-n arrangements are, somewhat unimaginatively, called NPN. Their p-n-p counterparts (PNP) operate with the emitter being more positive, and conduct when a current flows from the emitter to the base. The symbols of NPN and PNP transistors are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/bjt.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All bipolar transistors are more hairy than MOSFETs, for a couple of reasons. Firstly, they can't be driven by extremely high impedance signals, because some small base current must flow to enable conduction. Secondly, their diode junctions do not disappear fully when the transistor is conducting, resulting in an unavoidable voltage drop (V&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt;) across the device - usually between 0.1V and 0.4V when the transistor is saturated (i.e., further increases of base current have no effect). Similarly to MOSFETs, there is also a minimum base-emitter voltage required to overcome the potential of the BE junction (V&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt;), usually in the 0.6V - 0.8V range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three most common BJTs are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fairchildsemi.com/ds/2N/2N3904.pdf&quot;&gt;2N3904&lt;/a&gt; (NPN, 200 mA), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fairchildsemi.com/ds/PN/PN2222A.pdf&quot;&gt;PN2222A&lt;/a&gt; (NPN, 1A), and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fairchildsemi.com/ds/2N/2N3906.pdf&quot;&gt;2N3906&lt;/a&gt; (PNP, 200 mA). Higher-rated variants, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.classiccmp.org/rtellason/transdata/fjn965.pdf&quot;&gt;FJN965&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.datasheetcatalog.org/datasheet/fairchild/FJC1386.pdf&quot;&gt;FJC1386&lt;/a&gt; (NPN and PNP, 5A) can also be found, but MOSFETs are now being used almost exclusively in power applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Derived&quot; transistors:&lt;/strong&gt; a variety of more exotic transistor arrangements exists. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyristor&quot;&gt;Thyristors&lt;/a&gt; (also known as silicon controlled rectifiers, SCRs) are four-layer semiconductors that behave like latching transistors - i.e., keep conducting even after the base current stops; this effect can be also approximated by two discrete transistors (&lt;a href=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Thyristor.svg/500px-Thyristor.svg.png&quot;&gt;image&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darlington_transistor&quot;&gt;Darlington transistor&lt;/a&gt; is a pair of two NPN or PNP transistors stacked to achieve a much higher current gain; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sziklai_pair&quot;&gt;Sziklai pair&lt;/a&gt; is its heterogeneous (NPN+PNP) counterpart. Field effect transistors with multiple &quot;competing&quot; gate electrodes can also be seen, and are useful in signal mixing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the operation of transistors explained, it's good to additionally mention &lt;a href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phototransistor&quot;&gt;phototransistors&lt;/a&gt; - optoelectronic devices that operate very much like photodiodes, but feature internal gain; and optointerrupers - LED-phototransistor pairs mounted in a common enclosure, used for reflective or transmissive (slot) sensing in a variety of mechanical applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Analog circuits &lt;a name=&quot;20&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#20&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;20&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have the basic characteristics of electronic circuits, and the common components, sorted out, it's time to see what it's good for - starting with traditional, analog circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Components in parallel and in series &lt;a name=&quot;21&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#21&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;21&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When considering the behavior of real-world circuits, it is often essential to understand the actual resistance, capacitance, or inductance of signal pathways that may consist of more than one discrete component. Thankfully, this is fairly simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As should be fairly obvious, several resistors placed in series will have an equivalent resistance equal to the sum of all individual resistances:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;equiv&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + ...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resistors placed in parallel, on the other hand, have an equivalent resistance equal to the inverse of the sum of their inverse resistances:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;equiv&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 / (1/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + 1/R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 1/R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + ...)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This latter calculation is somewhat cumbersome, but for simplicity, it's good to remember that any number of identical resistors in parallel will have an equivalent resistance equal to &lt;code&gt;R/count&lt;/code&gt;, and the power rating will increase accordingly; and that if and if one of the resistors in parallel has a resistance several orders of magnitude lower than the rest, the resistances and power ratings of the remaining resistors may often be safely ignored altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly the same rules apply to the inductance and power ratings of inductors; and the voltage and current capability of voltage supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capacitors, on the other hand, behave differently; in parallel, their capacitance increases - and in series, drops. This is easy to understand by considering that several identical capacitors in series are essentially equivalent to a single capacitor with a thicker layer of a dielectric (the fact that these is a piece of conductor in the middle is of no significance for its operation) - and therefore, a lower ability to cancel out the electric field generated by unbalanced charges deposited on the plates; consequently, several capacitors in parallel resemble one capacitor with a larger plate surface area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9venin%27s_theorem&quot;&gt;Thevenin's theorem&lt;/a&gt; is a sometimes useful analytic tool, too: it gives a method for replacing any network of resistors, voltage sources, and current sources, with a single voltage source and a single resistor. You do not have to memorize it, but it's good to be aware of this possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Resistors as current limiters &lt;a name=&quot;22&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#22&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;22&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohm's law states that when a particular voltage is applied across resistor terminals, only a current proportional to this voltage, and inversely proportional to resistance, will be allowed to flow: &lt;code&gt;I = V/R&lt;/code&gt;. This brings us to the simplest application of resistors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/res_current.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this circuit, a 9V battery is supposed to light up a red LED. From the datasheet, we know that the LED, when supplied with 1.9V, sinks exactly 20 mA. Equipped with this knowledge, we can calculate that at this exact point, its internal resistance is 95 Ω. Unfortunately, diodes have a highly non-linear I-V curve - so when we connect 9V, its resistance will suddenly drop, several amps will be allowed flow through the junction; and the whole thing could - nay, will - catch fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, we can prevent this current from flowing in a very simple way. First, we need to find an equivalent resistor that, when placed across the terminals of our 9V battery, would conduct just 20 mA. Then, we can subtract 95 Ω - and get the resistance that needs to be placed in series with the diode to achieve the same result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;equiv&lt;/sub&gt; = 9V / 0.02A = 450 Ω&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;R = R&lt;sub&gt;equiv&lt;/sub&gt; - 95 Ω = 355 Ω&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The voltage drop across this resistor would be &lt;code&gt;0.02A * 355 Ω = 7.1V&lt;/code&gt; - leaving exactly 1.9V for the diode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build this circuit in practice, we can safely use use the nearest &quot;preferred&quot; resistor value, 330 Ω (which would actually allow 21.5 mA to flow through the device - well within the safety limits of most components).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this particular use, the power dissipated by the resistor (&lt;code&gt;P = I²R&lt;/code&gt;) will also be negligible - around 1/8 watt; for higher currents, the amount of dissipated heat goes through the roof pretty quickly, though - and therefore, resistor-based current limiters are useful only in low-power uses. This device is also not a perfect current limiter: if the apparent resistance of the driven device drops during normal operation, a more significant current will be allowed to flow. In both these cases, a more sophisticated, active circuit - implementing a &quot;real&quot; current source - is necessary instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also important not to treat a current-limiting resistor as a way to reduce voltage: note that with the load (LED) disconnected, no current will flow through the resistor - and therefore, there will be no voltage drop across its terminals (&lt;code&gt;V = IR&lt;/code&gt;); the output voltage of the circuit will be identical to that of the supply - and will drop quickly, but thanks to parasitic capacitances not instantaneously, when the load is connected again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Resistors as voltage dividers &lt;a name=&quot;23&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#23&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;23&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following circuit, with the lightbulb disconnected, the current flowing through the circuit will obviously be equal to &lt;code&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;supply&lt;/sub&gt; / (R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/res_voltage.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this, we can calculate the voltage measurable across the terminals of R2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;BA&lt;/sub&gt; = IR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;supply&lt;/sub&gt; * (R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; / (R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If R1 is equal to R2, the voltage across B and A will be 1/2 V&lt;sub&gt;supply&lt;/sub&gt;; if R2 is twice the R1, the B-A voltage will be 2/3 V&lt;sub&gt;supply&lt;/sub&gt;; and so forth - it's a simple matter of the ratio of resistances, independent of the absolute values of the resistors (and the resulting current flow). The circuit simply divides supply voltage by a desired factor - and in this, lies its utility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This divider is not a perfect voltage source, however: when you connect any resistive load (R3) between A and B - for example, the lightbulb shown on the schematic - it will introduce a new resistance parallel with R2. You may remember that this is equivalent to replacing R2 with a new resistor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 / (1/R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 1/R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the expected range of R3 values to be seen by the circuit is much higher than the value of R2, the effect is negligible - but when R2 and R3 are in the same league, the resulting voltage drop may become significant. Therefore, the resistors need to be picked with the expected loads - and the acceptable voltage swings - in mind. In many cases, this is not a big deal; but when driving power-hungry devices, R1 and R2 may have to be so low, that the resulting quiescent current through them would render the arrangement completely impractical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, practical resistor-based voltage dividers can be considered medium to high impedance sources, and should not be driving low impedance loads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Capacitors for energy storage &lt;a name=&quot;24&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#24&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;24&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following circuit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/cap_storage.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When SW1 is toggled, the capacitor will gradually charge through a resistor. Without this resistor, the time it takes for it to charge would be theoretically zero - and in practice, would be limited by poorly predictable factors such as the internal resistance of the device, or impedance of the power supply; but with a resistor, At &lt;code&gt;t = 5RC&lt;/code&gt;, the capacitor will be more than 99% charged, with almost no current flowing - and a voltage equivalent to that of the power source will be present across its terminals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if we open SW1 and close SW2 at that point? A current will be allowed to flow through the lightbulb, discharging the capacitor in a familiar manner, with discharge time governed by capacitance and the equivalent resistance of the driven device. The lightbulb will be getting more and more dim as the voltage across the capacitor drops; depending on its exact characteristics, somewhere around &lt;code&gt;t = 2R&lt;sub&gt;bulb&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; (15% of supply voltage), it will probably go completely dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more interesting case is what happens when both switches are switched on at the same time: assuming the non-linearity of the lightbulb is negligible (which is fair if the capacitor is large enough), initially, the capacitor will offer a low-impedance path, with very little current flowing through the bulb; but as the charge builds up, the voltage across its terminals will begin to rise - and more current will flow through the bulb. The capacitor will never charge past the voltage across the terminals of the lightbulb (which can be calculated from the lightbulb's resistance, as per Ohm's law) - and will discharge through it when SW1 is opened. In effect, this circuit gradually fades in and fades out the light when the switch is toggled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action of a capacitor in parallel with a load appears to be reminiscent to the behavior of a series inductor. There is one key difference inductors oppose changes in current for a longer time when the current is higher; whereas a capacitor has a more pronounced effect when the current that charges or discharges it is lower; were we to eliminate the upstream resistance, the capacitor would charge instantaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Passive resistor-capacitor (RC) signal filters &lt;a name=&quot;25&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#25&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;25&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variety of resistor-capacitor-inductor arrangements can be used to form circuits with interesting frequency response characteristics. Perhaps the the simplest case are the following two RC designs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the circuit shown on the left, the capacitor will be charged or discharged by any (sufficiently low-impedance) input signal at a rate controlled solely by the resistor; with the capacitor discharged, the output voltage will start at zero, and will begin approaching the input voltage only if the signal is applied for long enough (3RC or so). This has an interesting consequence: when the signal is a sine wave of a very low frequency, much lower than the capacitor charge time - the output voltage will, with a slight lag (phase shift), simply follow the input. As the frequency increases, however, the signal will get more and more attenuated - and the phase shift will become greater - as the source can't charge or discharge the capacitor quickly enough. This circuit is, therefore, a simple, passive low-pass filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of a linear response curve for this filter may look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/rc_low_lin.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A logarithmic plot over a larger scale of frequencies is perhaps more informative, though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/rc_low_log.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the second circuit shown on the earlier image? As it turns out, it exhibits exactly the opposite behavior: the capacitor prevents the flow of any DC currents - or the transfer of DC voltages - but when a negative voltage is applied to one of the plates, electrons will be pushed away from the other, and vice versa. If the resulting flow of charges is slow enough, they will simply drain through the resistor; but if the rate of change is very high, the resistor will limit the current, and develop a substantial, momentary voltage difference across its terminals. This circuit passes higher frequency sine wave signals largely unaltered, but attenuates slow-changing sine waves - a high-pass filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is customary to describe these circuits in terms of their cutoff frequency - a sine wave frequency at which the signal is attenuated to half its power (or, if you recall from the section on decibels, 0.7 of its input voltage). This point can be calculated as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;cutoff&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 / (2 * π * RC)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any sine wave frequency f, amplitude multiplier (g) for the transferred signal is ideally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;g&lt;sub&gt;lowpass&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 / √(1 + (f / f&lt;sub&gt;cutoff&lt;/sub&gt;)²)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;g&lt;sub&gt;highpass&lt;/sub&gt; = (f / f&lt;sub&gt;cutoff&lt;/sub&gt;) / √(1 + (f / f&lt;sub&gt;cutoff&lt;/sub&gt;)²)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As should be evident, there are many resistor-capacitor combinations that yield the same R*C product, and therefore, the same frequency response. The difference is that the smaller the resistor, and the larger the capacitor, the lower output impedance the filter will have - but the more power it will keep wasting, and the lower the impedance of the driving signal source would need to be to avoid distortion. The usual procedure, then, is to select R one or two orders of magnitude smaller than the impedance of the driven load - and calculate the right C for the required cutoff frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that these circuits work as expected only for sine waves (and in such a case, will output a sine wave, too). When fed with other waveforms, including square, triangle, or sawtooth signals, they will behave differently - and introduce interesting artifacts of their own. For example, for square waves (shown in green), the output of a low-pass filter below its cutoff frequency (i.e., transmissive state) may be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/rc_low_distort1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and well over the cutoff frequency, it may begin to resemble a sawtooth wave, with an amplitude decreasing in function of frequency:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/rc_low_distort2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output for a low-pass filter is essentially proportional to how long the signal stayed in a particular state; for this reason, it is sometimes called an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral&quot;&gt;integrator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The behavior of a high-pass filter fed with a square wave is perhaps even more interesting - with a voltage proportional to the rate of change of the input signal (hence the nickname: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_%28mathematics%29&quot;&gt;differentiator&lt;/a&gt;). Above the cut-off frequency (i.e., in its transmissive state), the output may look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/rc_high_distort1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...while well below the cut-off frequency, it may begin to resemble:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/rc_high_distort2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that in both cases, the high-pass filter peak output amplitude is nearly twice the input amplitude; only the average power of the signal (RMS) is affected when the input frequency changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to spot these waveforms is actually extremely useful when debugging digital circuits, where square wave signals are used extensively. An unexpected low-pass filter distortion seen in a digital signal is usually indicative of excessive capacitance of the signal path, perhaps because the connection is too long, or runs too close to others; while a high-pass pattern may indicate a broken trace or cut wire, forming an unwelcome capacitor in series with the source of the signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-pass and high-pass filters can be cascaded to form band-pass or band-stop filters; identical filters can also be stacked to achieve a steeper response curve (n-th order filters, with g&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; frequency transmission function). That said, this process has its limits: every stage needs to have an impedance much lower than the subsequent stage it is driving, which quickly leads to impractical or very inefficient arrangements; and every stage attenuates the desired signal to some extent, inevitably reducing signal-to-noise ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Inductors in signal filters (RL and RLC circuits) &lt;a name=&quot;26&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#26&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;26&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inductors can replace capacitors in RC filters, reversing their operation: an RL filter with the same topology as an RC low-pass filter will act as a high-pass filter, and vice versa; the reason for this should be fairly evident. The cutoff frequency for RL filters is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;cutoff&lt;/sub&gt; = R / (2 * π * L)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other aspects, the signal response of RL filters is essentially identical to that of their RC counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more interesting class of circuits are RLC arrangements where the capacitor is &quot;fighting&quot; the inductor, and the resistor moderates the maximum current supplied to them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/rlc_filters.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The circuit on the left is, essentially, a band-pass filter: the capacitor needs the signal to change slowly enough to charge it up to an appreciable level - and above this frequency, serves as a shunt; but when the current is not changing fast enough, the inductor will begin conducting and will discharge the capacitor. This can be thought of as a combination of an RC low-pass and an RL high-pass filter, with a peak bandpass frequency of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;peak&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 / (2 * π * √(LC))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and a bandwidth between 3dB attenuation points of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;BW = R / (2 * π * L)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of adjusting bandwidth by changing the value of R is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/rlc_pass_gentle.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/rlc_pass_sharp.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, the optimal way to design an RLC band-pass filter is to pick R to achieve the desired output impedance; continue with L for the desired bandwidth; and finally, C to set the center frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to the other circuit shown earlier, on the right - it is a band-stop filter: the coil conducts well only below a certain frequency, and the capacitor conducts well only above another; the signal will be shunted to the ground most efficiently in between the frequencies. The only difference is that the blocked bandwidth is given as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;BW = 1 / (2 * π * RC)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many other RLC circuits can be designed, although these two approaches are most useful when easily understood dependence on source and load impedances is required. As with RC and RL filters, the gotcha with RLC circuits is that in signal processing, the impedance of the driven load must be significantly higher than that of the signal source and the series resistor in the circuit - or else, distortion will appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Transistors as switches &lt;a name=&quot;27&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#27&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;27&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transistors differ from passive electronic circuits because of their ability to introduce gain - that is, turn low-amplitude voltage signals into high-amplitude ones, or high-impedance signals into low-impedance ones. For now, let's neglect their more complex response characteristics, and focus on a very simple, binary switching application - using a potentially low voltage or high impedance signal to control a power-hungry or high-voltage load:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/transistor_sw.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The circuits in the A column show common, proper transistor switch arrangements for NPN, PNP, and MOSFET n-channel enhancement mode transistors - known as &quot;common emitter&quot; (BJT) or &quot;common drain&quot; (FET). In NPN and PNP circuits, note the use of a resistor to limit the base-emitter current: the current flowing through this path &lt;u&gt;must be controlled&lt;/u&gt;, because the corresponding junction is essentially a normal, forward-biased diode - and will conduct as much current as you supply, possibly destroying the transistor in the process (and certainly making it misbehave).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bipolar transistors have a device-specific current gain ratio, usually labeled as &lt;code&gt;h&lt;sub&gt;FE&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the datasheets. Relying on this intrinsic gain is usually not a good idea for production-grade circuits, as the parameter can change significantly at a whim - but by looking at its general order of magnitude, you can see what input impedance would be appropriate. For example, if h&lt;sub&gt;FE&lt;/sub&gt; = 100, and the load requires a current of 500 mA, at least 5 mA of base current should be supplied (supplying more will be wasteful and may lower switching speed, but the margins here are pretty wide). Base-collector junction voltage is probably around 0.7V, so with a 5V supply, a voltage of 4.3V would be present across the resistor; from Ohm's law, and with an ample safety margin, a 680 Ω resistor would be a good bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the need to limit current, the NPN arrangement shown in column B is &lt;u&gt;universally&lt;/u&gt; a bad idea: it will likely destroy the transistor; its PNP equivalent is equally disastrous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MOSFET transistor shown in column A generally does not require a resistor, at least at low signal frequencies, because it does not allow any appreciably long-lived current to flow through the gate (at very high frequencies, the small but non-zero gate-source capacitance becomes a factor, though). It does, however, need bipolar switching: if you simply apply a positive voltage to the gate, and then disconnect it - the gate-source &quot;capacitor&quot; will stay charged, and the transistor will continue conducting for a longer while (dependent on humidity, handling, etc); even after this charge disappears, a new one can be easily accumulated due to further handling, parasitic coupling, and so forth. This is why the MOSFET circuit shown in column B is always a bad idea, too. It can be alternatively fixed by adding a large pull-down resistor from the gate to the ground, to dissipate the deposited charge when the switch is opened, but at the expense of lowering input impedance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Column C shows another arrangement that is not universally problematic, but should be avoided in switching where possible - and is all-too-common in hobbyist work: loading the emitter (BJT) or drain (MOSFET) - a configuration known as &quot;common collector&quot; or &quot;common source&quot;. The problem with this is that all real-world loads will develop some voltage across them in normal operation; this raises the emitter or source voltage accordingly - perhaps close to, or even above, the driving base / gate voltage. This causes the switching to be far more erratic, especially with inductive loads. There are uses where this arrangement makes sense - but switching is not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all cases, the driving voltage applied to the base (or gate) must be high enough to trigger the transistor; that is, at least 0.6V in BJT, and at least 1-2V for most MOSFETs. At this point, the transistor just barely begins conducting - so ideally, in switching applications, V&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; should be comfortably higher. In BJTs, around 1V (&quot;base saturation voltage&quot;) is sufficient to achieve a full range of meaningful base currents; in MOSFETs, resistance becomes negligible usually around 3.8V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drawback of the transistor switches shown earlier is that they work in a manner similar to a single-pole switch: they can connect the load to the ground (NPN, n-channel MOSFET) or to the supply rail (PNP, p-channel MOSFET), or simply leave it in open circuit state. When turning on a lightbulb or a LED, this is not a problem - but when driving inductive or capacitive loads (including the gates of MOSFET transistors), or encoding information as voltage levels, it may be more desirable to offer two-pole operation, where the output can be switched between two low-impedance rails. The simplest way to do so is a push-pull circuit that uses complementary transistors to do the job:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/transistor_pushpull.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the input voltage is close to 0V, the bottom transistor will not conduct, but the upper one will. When the voltage is close to the positive rail, the situation will reverse. When the voltage is somewhere in between, though, both transistors may end up conducting, shorting the circuit - so caution must be exercised; this problem can be controlled by carefully biasing bases / gates using resistor-based voltage dividers, but it may affect switching performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also note that the upper transistor, connected to the positive rail, is PNP or p-type MOSFET; and the bottom one, grounded, is NPN or n-type MOSFET. This ensures that both transistors are operating in common emitter / common source mode, suitable for switching. Reversing the order of these transistors may lead to trouble for the reasons discussed above; the same goes for trying to use two identical transistors, just hooked up in opposite ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else? Ah, inductive loads, such as motors, deserve some special attention: when a current supplied to an inductor is suddenly cut off, the energy stored in the collapsing magnetic field will try to keep the charge carriers in motion; and if this proves to be impossible, a very brief (nanoseconds) but significant (up to kilovolts) electromotive force will be created. This phenomenon is responsible for the sparking commonly seen in low-voltage brushed motors or toggle switches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, this transient voltage may damage sensitive transistors in the vicinity - for example, compromising the gate insulator in MOSFETs, or simply overheating and vaporizing a part of the junction. To prevent this, a reverse-biased, normally non-conductive diode with a sufficient power rating is sometimes placed across such loads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/transistor_motor.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The function of this diode is to begin conducting, due to the breakdown effect, when the terminal voltage gets dangerously high. To be fair: in most cases, such a diode is not necessary - because switching is never perfectly instantaneous, inductors are never ideal, and the parasitic inductances, capacitances, and resistances of the circuit will dissipate the energy before it gets near a fragile semiconductor - but these factors are not necessarily predictable, so especially with more significant inductances, it is simply a good engineering practice... after all, a suitable diode usually costs just several cents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Transistors as voltage followers and amplifiers &lt;a name=&quot;28&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#28&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;28&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous section discusses the use of transistors as binary switches operated in their saturation region - that is, the point where the resistance is minimal, and the admitted current is at its peak. Another important and more subtle use of these semiconductor devices is amplification, however - modulating output signals in relation to input voltage or current.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most rudimentary, but surprisingly not the most interesting application of a transistor as an amplifier is the previously discussed common emitter / common source setup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/transistor_camp.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current supplied to the load remains in some clear relation to the input current (BJT) or voltage (MOSFET), for as long as the input remains in the &quot;linear&quot; range for the device. Alas, the exact input-output ratio (h&lt;sub&gt;fe&lt;/sub&gt;) is hard to predict - the parameter changes from one batch of transistors to another, and is also highly influenced by factors such as voltage or temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use this arrangement to adjust the speed of a motor with a small potentiometer, or perform other non-critical tasks of this nature; but for anything that requires precision and repeatability, this is just poor engineering: people should be able to substitute transistors used in your circuit with comparable alternatives, or use a 5% accuracy input resistor, and still have it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, instead, let's have a look at a more useful, if modest, type of a simple transistor circuit: a voltage follower, also known as a buffer. In this &quot;common collector&quot; / &quot;common drain&quot; device, output voltage simply follows the input voltage 1:1 (a setup known as &quot;unity gain&quot;); its utility is that a high-impedance input can be &quot;converted&quot; in a low-impedance, high current capability output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/v_followers.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand why the circuit shown in the first column works as advertised (and why no base resistor is needed), it is important to recall that an NPN transistor will only admit any base-emitter current (and therefore, collector-emitter current) when the voltage difference between the base and the emitter is sufficient to overcome the potential of the internal p-n diode junction (circa 0.6V). In other words, the transistor will only try to conduct just enough current - bulk of it through the collector-emitter pathway - to keep the voltage across R1 (and therefore, at V&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;) at exactly V&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; - 0.6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohm's law states that the current needed to develop a particular voltage across the resistor will be proportional to the desired voltage, and inversely proportional to resistance; if R1 is reasonable, so is the collector-emitter current. The base-emitter voltage is kept near the diode conduction threshold, so the current flowing through this path is also very low and self-limiting (and naturally, avoided entirely in MOSFETs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This circuit has some drawbacks, though. For starters, there is a voltage offset present between the input and the output; for inputs between 0 and 0.6V, the output will be simply clipped at 0V. Connecting the emitter to a negative voltage at least 0.6V higher than the lowest signal voltage is a potential solution to the clipping problem - but it may be impractical in some settings. Another simple (but imperfect) way to prevent this problem begins with AC coupling - the introduction of a series capacitor that prevents any steady DC currents or voltage levels from propagating through it, but allows time-varying signals to induce a voltage across it. Once this is done, a simple resistor-based voltage divider can be used to add an arbitrary bias to the resulting AC signal, for example to add +3V. This circuit is shown in column B above. Its key flaw is evident once we recognize the capacitor and the resistors as a high-pass filter: this filter inevitably attenuates sufficiently low frequencies and DC voltage drifts. In many cases, this is not a big deal - the capacitor and the resistors can be selected with the interesting range of frequencies in mind; but fundamentally, the follower is no longer maintaining direct relationship between input and output voltages - and merely between their rates of change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bias and clipping aside, another problem with simple voltage followers that they can only source, but not drain, significant currents. This is more of a deal here with voltage followers than it is with switches: consider driving a capacitor as a load, connected across the &quot;out&quot; node and the ground. When V&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; is 6V, the capacitor will very quickly charge to 5.4V, as a significant current flows through the transistor. Alas, when V&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; later drops to 2V, V&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; will stay at 5.4V - and because emitter voltage is now higher than base voltage, the transistor will not conduct. The capacitor will slowly discharge through R1 - but R1 can't be arbitrarily low (the quiescent current flowing at all times through the follower would be rather impractical if we go too far, and input loading would increase, too). Until then, the follower will not be following the input voltage at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple way to fix it is to have the input signal drive two complementary transistors at the same time, placed on both sides of the &quot;out&quot; node; this is known as a push-pull amplifier. This arrangement still suffers from the 0.6V bias - but this time, it can be solved more neatly than with AC coupling: by biasing both transistors into symmetrical, slight conduction when V&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; is at the mid-point - and simply relying on the input signal to swing the ratio. This bias-compensated, DC-coupled voltage follower is shown in column C above; try to think for a moment about how it works in practice - and observe that the arrangement of transistors is opposite to that in a push-pull switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voltage followers may sound boring, but they are immensely useful in electronic circuits; for example, they can be used to bridge a significant number of RLC band-pass or band-stop filters, or to convert very faint high-impedance currents from external sensors into outputs suitable for other circuitry. Still, you are probably wondering about a different task more commonly associated with amplifiers: increasing the amplitude of a weak signal. When faced with this problem, almost all hobbyists immediately think of the intuitive, h&lt;sub&gt;fe&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent circuit discussed initially in this section - but there is a better way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/transistor_camp2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's see how this works: the transistor will seek to supply such a current to R2 to achieve a voltage matching V&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; - 0.6V across this resistor (assuming for a while that R1 permits so); as per Ohm's law, &lt;code&gt;I = (V&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; - 0.6) / R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This flow of current, however, will also create a voltage across R1: &lt;code&gt;V = IR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = (V&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; - 0.6) * R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; / R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. In other words, V&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; will be amplified by &lt;sub&gt;R1/R2&lt;/sub&gt; - with no dependency on h&lt;sub&gt;fe&lt;/sub&gt;! Note that in this particular circuit, the output signal is inverted (i.e., is at supply voltage when V&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; is 0V); that problem is obviously easy to correct if necessary - for example by adding a second stage with R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting extension of this simple concept is a differential amplifier - a device that compares two voltages, and outputs the difference between them, multiplied by some factor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/amplifier_diff.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This circuit essentially consists of two conjoined voltage amplifiers from the previous example. When their base voltages are identical, they agree on what the voltage of their emitters should be; each will contribute 50% of the current that needs to flow through R2 to produce that result. When V&lt;sub&gt;in2&lt;/sub&gt; is higher than V&lt;sub&gt;in1&lt;/sub&gt;, the right transistor will insist on getting the emitter voltage to a point where the left one no longer conducts - and so, the current flowing through the right R1 (and the associated voltage drop) will increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to the point of it all: differential amplifiers are extremely useful for subtracting RF interference or removing or adding bias voltages from input signals without the need to use AC coupling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, a wide range of refinements to these basic designs is known today - say, to improve linearity, bandwidth, or to compensate for temperature variations. You will also probably stumble upon many other, more exotic transistor circuits not covered here - such as, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ecircuitcenter.com/Circuits_Audio_Amp/Diff_Amp_w_Mirror/image004.gif&quot;&gt;current mirrors&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_base&quot;&gt;common base&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_gate&quot;&gt;common gate&lt;/a&gt; amplifiers - but you can probably figure them out by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Diodes as shunts and regulators &lt;a name=&quot;29&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#29&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;29&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tendency for diodes to maintain a precise voltage drop across their terminals is often exploited to provide precise voltage references in a circuit. Forward-biased diodes, with their 0.2 - 0.7V voltage drops, are usually less useful; but reverse-biased Zener diodes are a wholly different story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most unsophisticated use of a diode is a shunt; shunts may be placed across the terminals of high-impedance, low-precision signal sources to trim the voltage to a particular level; or to suppress transient voltage spikes caused by inductors, electrostatic discharge, or even lightning strikes (using a specialized &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varistor&quot;&gt;varistor&lt;/a&gt; diode). The usual &quot;dumb&quot; shunt circuit is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/diode_shunt.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While very useful for controlling high-impedance signals, the diode simply serves as a &quot;crowbar&quot; across the supply terminals - and therefore, for input voltage sources that can source a significant current, this arrangement gets dangerously inefficient; a resistor can be used to limit supply current, of course - but this simply takes you back to the high-impedance scenario - not very useful for, say, driving motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple modification of this approach is to combine a voltage follower with a reverse-biased diode; the follower will then always attempt to output a voltage equivalent to diode breakdown voltage, minus the inherent drop across the follower itself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/diode_shunt2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resistor on diode side should be selected to limit the current through the diode to a reasonable value, so that it has an opportunity to develop a voltage across its terminals in the first place, but so that it does not waste too much power. The spec for the diode usually gives a &quot;rated reverse current&quot; or I&lt;sub&gt;ZT&lt;/sub&gt; figure, corresponding to the rated reverse voltage; in most cases, several milliamps is ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previously discussed modifications of the voltage follower circuit - to allow adjustable voltage amplification and push-pull operation - are just as applicable to this regulator. The key advantage of this design is that unlike a resistor-based voltage divider, it does not waste tons of energy - and achieves much better regulation over a wide range of possible loads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diodes are also commonly used to build constant-current sources, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Const_cur_src_111.gif&quot;&gt;this circuit&lt;/a&gt;: this arrangement will admit only as much current as needed to create a particular voltage across the constant &quot;sense&quot; resistor, R2, regardless of the potentially variable voltage drop seen across the connected load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Diodes as rectifiers, DC restorers, and voltage multipliers &lt;a name=&quot;30&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#30&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;30&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forward-biased diodes serve a number of useful functions of their own. Let's begin with basic rectifiers - devices used to extract the absolute value of a voltage that swings both ways from the 0V rail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/rectifiers.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The behavior of the first circuit - known as a half-wave rectifier - should be fairly clear: the diode conducts, and therefore creates a voltage across the resistor (a dummy load), only if the first input is more positive than the other; in this circuit, diode breakdown voltage is selected high enough not to interfere with this process. The second circuit - a bridge or full-wave rectifier - is a bit more clever, but also easy to follow: opposing pairs of diodes are used to select the more positive or negative out of two input leads, and always produce a particular output polarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this useful? Well, the input AC signal, which (if symmetrical and steady) has an average DC voltage of 0V; if you connect a large capacitor to it, its average charge will also be 0V, and all the energy used for charging will be wasted. The output waveform from a rectifier has non-zero average DC voltage, though - corresponding to the amplitude of the input signal (shown below in green in the graph below). This output can be then used to construct rudimentary approximations of DC voltages using just a single cap (red is the voltage across the load):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/dc_filter.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This circuit, common in mains-powered supplies, should be fairly easy to understand: a low impedance AC signal is rectified, and then used to instantaneously charge a capacitor; the capacitor will only be charged if its terminal voltage is below that of the rectified waveform, too - at all other times, the diodes are reverse-biased and do not conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as the rate at which this capacitor is discharged by a load is much lower than the rate at which it can be recharged, the output signal is a close approximation of a DC supply; the larger the capacitor, the smoother the DC output is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variation of this circuit is called an envelope follower: in this case, the resistor and the capacitor are matched to form a low-pass filter that &quot;masks out&quot; a high-frequency carrier, but passes through a lower frequency envelope (in this use, no significant output loading is present). Envelope followers are commonly used to separate modulated audio signals from high-frequency carrier signals used in radio transmission:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/envelope_follower.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting use of a diode is DC restoration - a process where a symmetrical AC signal is offset so that the flow of current becomes unidirectional - but that the waveform is not distorted otherwise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/dc_restorer.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This arrangement may be a bit tricky to understand: the key point is that when a negative voltage -X is applied to a reasonably large capacitor by a low-impedance source, the internal electric field will induce a similar voltage on its other terminal (i.e., any external electromotive force will propagate through the dielectric medium when no existing charge is deposited on its plates) - and this will prompt the diode to begin conducting, allowing the current to flow, charging the capacitor to -X volts, and keeping the potential between output terminals close to 0V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the input voltage then swings to +X some time later, the resulting electromagnetic field propagates a 2X voltage swing across the capacitor; but this time, the reverse-biased diode will not conduct, and will prevent the already deposited charge from exiting the capacitor (except through any externally connected load). The subsequent -2X swing will bring the output voltage close to 0V, then back to 2X, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, to avoid surprises, the capacitor must be large enough not to form such a high-pass filter with the load (or the always weakly conductive diode) as to substantially attenuate the input AC signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A really interesting combination of the previous two circuits is a diode-based voltage multiplier: the output of a DC restorer can be used to gradually charge a capacitor to the peak output voltage, which is then used as a ground reference for another DC restorer. The behavior is illustrated below, with a 5V amplitude AC signal as the input:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/diode_multiplier.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voila - we turned an AC signal with peak-to-peak voltage of 10V into a DC signal with peak voltage of 20V. The multiplier can be stacked, although diode and capacitor leakage currents and other losses put some constraints on its scalability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Transistor-based oscillators &lt;a name=&quot;31&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#31&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;31&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resistors, inductors, capacitors, and piezoelectric crystals may be arranged into many types of resonant circuits that will generate alternating voltages; one of the simplest examples is just a capacitor and an inductor in a closed, series loop: a previously charged capacitor will discharge through the inductor; the resulting magnetic field will then collapse and induce a current that re-charges the capacitor - and so forth (the resonant frequency is &lt;code&gt;1 / (2 * π * √(LC))&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem with such circuits is that they lose energy and stop oscillating appreciably after, at best, several dozen swings: some of the magnetic field will be inevitably dissipated, and so will some of the current due to real-world resistances and capacitor leakage. Transistors come to the rescue, however: by detecting a particular state of the oscillator and supplying additional energy - a well-timed push - the oscillation can be sustained indefinitely. Simple transistor LC circuits, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartley_oscillator&quot;&gt;Hartley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armstrong_oscillator&quot;&gt;Armstrong&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clapp_oscillator&quot;&gt;Clapp&lt;/a&gt; oscillators make use of this operating principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the basic operation of many types of oscillators, let's have a look at this simple, RC-only square wave oscillator (aka &quot;multivibrator&quot;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/multivibrator.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The circuit consists of two identical MOSFET switches driving small resistive loads equipped with an output tap; this tap will be at V&lt;sub&gt;supply&lt;/sub&gt; when the MOSFET is off, and close to 0V when fully conducting. This output voltage is then AC coupled through a capacitor (C = 1 µF), biased to ½ V&lt;sub&gt;supply&lt;/sub&gt; using a voltage divider consisting of two large (R = 100k) resistors - and finally employed to drive the gate of a complementary MOSFET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the circuit is initially turned on, the MOSFET on the right will turn on first, as its gate is driven through a slightly smaller resistor. This will cause it to pull the output down, and create a negative voltage across the capacitor driving the left transistor. This negative voltage will prevent that MOSFET from turning on until the charge is dissipated through the voltage divider (which takes time proportional to the capacitances and resistances involved) - and the gate is positive enough again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the left transistor will turn on, and create a negative voltage on the gate of the other MOSFET, turning it off for a while. The cycle will repeat indefinitely, generating a square wave (the frequency of which is approximately &lt;code&gt;0.72 / RC&lt;/code&gt; - or about 7 Hz in this particular case).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Analog integrated circuits &lt;a name=&quot;32&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#32&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;32&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to discrete components, a wide selection of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit&quot;&gt;integrated circuits&lt;/a&gt; is available today. These highly miniaturized, modular building blocks consist from anywhere from several to hundreds of millions individual components packed on a single die, usually produced by the means of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photolithography&quot;&gt;photolithography&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the most popular varieties of analog ICs are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transistor drivers:&lt;/strong&gt; one of the most rudimentary classes of integrated circuits, these chips consists of a modest number of individual transistors, often with protective resistors and diodes, to be used as line drivers (i.e., impedance converters). One of the most common devices in this category is &lt;a href=&quot;http://focus.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/uln2003a.pdf&quot;&gt;ULN2003A&lt;/a&gt;, a set of six Darlington transistors; more complex devices with push-pull control or low-distortion signal switching, also exist, and are just as easy to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_amplifier&quot;&gt;Operational amplifiers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; advanced, differential push-pull voltage amplifiers with very high impedances (sometimes using JFET or MOSFET transistors), variable gain, temperature and supply voltage compensation, internal biasing, voltage drop compensation, and so forth - essentially designed to approximate a perfect amplifier within a fairly wide range of operating conditions. Op-amps usually accept two inputs (non-inverting, marked as &quot;+&quot;; and inverting, marked as &quot;-&quot;) and have one output. When the input voltages are identical, the output voltage is exactly 50% of the supply range; and when the voltages differ, the difference will be amplified and output as a swing toward the negative or the positive supply rail. The &quot;default&quot; amplification of an op-amp is very high and not necessarily well-defined - but can be controlled very precisely by adding a negative feedback pathway between the output and the inverting input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common use of an op-amp is probably building a &quot;normal&quot; single-input amplifier; the amplification is then equal to the ratio of the feedback resistor (R1) to the impedance of the other signal supplied the inverting input (R2, generally in the 10 - 100 kΩ, depending on the op-amp). The two most common circuits here are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/opamps.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other uses of op-amps include voltage followers (R1 = R2), voltage comparators (both inputs untied for maximum amplification), linear drivers for power-hungry loads such as audio speakers; and in general, the approximation of the ideal behavior of a variety of other electronic circuits in amplifiers, oscillators, rectifiers, filters, and so forth; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_amplifier_applications&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; has a nice catalog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many traditional op-amps require the input voltages to keep a certain distance from the supply voltages, requiring careful biasing or a dual voltage supply in certain uses. Many modern chips used in signal processing accept rail-to-rail inputs and have rail-to-rail outputs, however, allowing them to be more easily operated from a single supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more popular chips suitable for single-supply operation are the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.national.com/ds/LM/LM124.pdf&quot;&gt;LM124&lt;/a&gt; family (including LM224, LM324, LM2902) and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.national.com/ds/LM/LM158.pdf&quot;&gt;LM158&lt;/a&gt; family (LM258, LM358, LM2904) - all of which vary slightly, but are interchangeable in almost all uses. For extremely high input impedances, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.datasheetcatalog.org/datasheet/texasinstruments/tlc27l4.pdf&quot;&gt;TLC27L4&lt;/a&gt; is a reasonably priced family of MOSFET-based chips; and for low-noise applications (e.g. audio processing), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.onsemi.com/pub/Collateral/NE5534-D.PDF&quot;&gt;NE5534&lt;/a&gt; is an affordable choice. Oh, a relatively cheap high current op-amp is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.st.com/stonline/books/pdf/docs/1317.pdf&quot;&gt;L165V&lt;/a&gt;, capable of delivering over 3A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_comparator&quot;&gt;Voltage comparators&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; specialized op-amp like chips designed for very high amplification and fast recovery from saturation, used specifically to compare voltages and output discrete voltage levels corresponding to the result. They are used in accurate sensing circuitry, in power management, in some types of oscillators, etc. Common examples include the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.national.com/ds/LM/LM393.pdf&quot;&gt;LM193&lt;/a&gt; family (LM293, LM393, LM2903); voltage threshold detectors (with internal, diode-based voltage references) are also available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oscillators:&lt;/strong&gt; many types of ICs are used as timers (one-shot operation) or oscillators (continuous, astable operation); perhaps the most famous member of this family is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.national.com/ds/LM/LM555.pdf&quot;&gt;555&lt;/a&gt;, a very versatile pulse and square / sawtooth wave generator that can be controlled over a wide range of frequencies with an external capacitor and two resistors. The chip is fairly dated and quirky, but it has a number of modern, power-efficient FET successors, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intersil.com/data/fn/fn2867.pdf&quot;&gt;ICM7555&lt;/a&gt;. A good overview of possible 555 circuits can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kpsec.freeuk.com/555timer.htm&quot;&gt;this webpage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rectifiers:&lt;/strong&gt; fairly self-explanatory: pre-packaged diodes in half-wave or full-wave arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulators:&lt;/strong&gt; high current capability, transistor-based voltage or current limiters, often adjustable with an external resistor. We covered the operating principle of linear regulators earlier in this guide; some of the more advanced and power-efficient switched mode devices use more sophisticated circuitry to pulse inductors or capacitors - and sometimes, are even capable of generating voltages higher than the input signal - although their operation is electrically more noisy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensor chips:&lt;/strong&gt; miniature optoelectronic or electromechanical devices are being increasingly more common; some of the popular examples include &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opto-isolator&quot;&gt;optocouplers&lt;/a&gt; (LED and a phototransistor in a single package, to relay optical signals while maintaining galvanic separation between circuits to minimize noise or ensure user safety), a variety of internally amplified sensors (such as solid-state compasses based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect&quot;&gt;Hall effect&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer&quot;&gt;accelerometers&lt;/a&gt;, single-chip &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscope&quot;&gt;gyroscopes&lt;/a&gt;, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Digital circuits &lt;a name=&quot;33&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#33&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;33&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics&quot;&gt;Digital electronics&lt;/a&gt; are a class of easy to understand circuits that use discrete voltage ranges and square waveforms to transmit and process data - most commonly, representing &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_numeral_system&quot;&gt;binary numbers&lt;/a&gt; for use in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra_%28logic%29&quot;&gt;Boolean algebra&lt;/a&gt;: a signal close to 0V is meant to signify &quot;0&quot;, and a signal close to V&lt;sub&gt;cc&lt;/sub&gt; signifies &quot;1&quot;. They are designed to allow one digital component to be interfaced to any other without having to carefully consider the effects related to impedance, attenuation, noise, and other &quot;analog&quot; phenomena (well, within certain common-sense boundaries) - greatly simplifying large-scale circuit design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section gives a quick overview of the most fundamental building blocks in digital signal processing and computing. While many types of highly integrated digital circuits, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller&quot;&gt;microcontrollers&lt;/a&gt;, are extremely complex, their functionality is generally implemented using these basic devices - and can be easily analyzed as such. In fact, a simple general-purpose computer can be assembled from scratch in a couple of weeks without any exceptional skill or resources at your disposal; it will be much slower and equipped with only rudimentary memory and I/O - but will otherwise function perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Logic gates &lt;a name=&quot;34&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#34&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;34&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boolean algebra is a fairly simple and intuitive binary number (aka logic value) calculus that, by the virtue of its completeness, can be used to implement any other algebraic system, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic&quot;&gt;decimal arithmetics&lt;/a&gt;. The system is commonly explained in terms of the following operators (often illustrated using &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table&quot;&gt;truth tables&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nullary&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Constant 0 output&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constant 1 output&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unary&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identity (buffer) - output identical to the input value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Negation (NOT) - output inverse to the input value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Binary&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conjunction (AND) - output is 1 only if both inputs are 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disjunction (OR) - output is 1 if any of the inputs is 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exclusive-or (XOR) - output is 1 only if input values are different&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sheffer stroke (NAND) - inverted-output AND&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pierce arrow (NOR) - inverted-output OR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equivalence (EQV / XNOR) - inverted-output XOR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Circuit symbols of gates implementing these operators are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/gate_symbols.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other derived, if less useful, binary operators are permitted (a total of 16); so are other arities - but all these variants can be constructed from the basic set of operators outlined above. In fact, even this set is redundant - any operator can be constructed from NAND or NOR alone, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;NOT(a) → NAND(a, a)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;AND(a, b) → NOT(NAND(a, b))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;OR(a, b) → NAND(NOT(a), NOT(b))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several transistor-based approaches to implementing voltage-based Boolean algebra were pursued in the past; most notably, in the 80s and 90s, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor-transistor_logic&quot;&gt;transistor-to-transistor logic&lt;/a&gt; (TTL), a scheme that employed exotic dual-emitter BJT transistors, dominated the marketplace - but today, simpler and more power-efficient &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS&quot;&gt;complementary MOSFET&lt;/a&gt; (CMOS) gates are used almost exclusively in all modern chips. At their core, these devices employ a simple, low-power MOSFET push-pull switch you may remember from earlier sections of this guide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/mosfet_pushpull.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This switch, by itself, is a NOT gate: it pulls the output to V&lt;sub&gt;cc&lt;/sub&gt; if input is 0V, and vice versa. To construct a NAND gate, this arrangement is extended the following way (note that Q1 is a four-terminal transistor, so that gate operates in reference to circuit ground, rather than to source terminal voltage):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/cmos_nand.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's see how this works: when input A and B are low, Q3 and Q4 will conduct, but Q1 and Q2 will not - and this will pull the output high. When both inputs are high, only Q1 and Q2 will conduct - and pull the output low. With only A high, Q1 will attempt to conduct, but this effort will be thwarted by Q2 in off state; in the meantime, Q3 will pull the output high. Finally, with only B input in high state, Q1 will prevent Q2 from doing anything useful, but Q4 will conduct - again, resulting in &quot;1&quot;. This behavior coincides with the truth table for the NAND gate - amazing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because gates are not expected to directly drive significant loads (several milliamps is usually the limit), CMOS transistors are selected so that their resistances and voltage response characteristics eliminate the risk of short-circuit damage when input voltage is somewhere between ground and V&lt;sub&gt;cc&lt;/sub&gt;; that said, output voltage levels and other gate characteristics are guaranteed to be sane only within certain specific ranges of &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; inputs. For example, for 5V CMOS chips, &quot;0&quot; should be under approximately 1.3V, and &quot;1&quot; should be over 3.7V - in which case, the output is guaranteed to stay under 0.2V for &quot;0&quot; and over 4.7V for &quot;1&quot;, respectively. As should be evident, low output impedance gates with such output levels can be chained indefinitely with no signal deterioration - which is the key premise of all digital circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, older TTL chips may expect under 0.8V and over 2.0V as inputs, and promise output under 0.35V and over 3.3V, respectively; this has some consequences when attempting to interface TTL and CMOS circuits in a reliable way - sometimes requiring pull-up or pull-down resistors on the input lines; but that's a separate story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most popular families of individual CMOS logic gates available today is undoubtedly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mouser.com/Semiconductors/Integrated-Circuits-ICs/Logic-ICs/_/N-6j77xZscv7?P=1z0y3hmZ1z0z63x&quot;&gt;74HC00&lt;/a&gt;; followed by now somewhat less common &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mouser.com/Semiconductors/Integrated-Circuits-ICs/Logic-ICs/_/N-6j77xZscv7?P=1yzxt7kZ1z0z63x&quot;&gt;4000 series&lt;/a&gt; chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Adder circuits &lt;a name=&quot;35&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#35&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;35&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the power of Boolean algebra, it is useful to take a stab at building a simple adder - a device that computes a sum of two integers represented as binary numbers, and one of the fundamental components of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit&quot;&gt;arithmetic logic units&lt;/a&gt; in all computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binary addition works in a fairly straightforward way, analogous to what we are accustomed to in the decimal system. When adding individual digits of two numbers, right to left, the following rules apply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;0 + 0 = 0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;0 + 1 = 1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;1 + 0 = 1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;1 + 1 = 0, 1 carries over&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to notice that the immediate result is equivalent to XOR of the input values; while the carry bit is determined by the AND operation. A simple circuit that implements this logic - called &quot;half adder&quot; - is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/adders.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other circuit - a full adder - can additionally accept a third input, the carry-over value from the previous column; this value is fed into an second adder stage after the immediate inputs are summed; additionally, if any of the stages contributes a carry bit, this value is propagated to the output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;0 + 0 + carry 0 = 0 + 0 = 0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;0 + 1 + carry 0 = 1 + 0 = 0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;1 + 0 + carry 0 = 1 + 0 = 0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;1 + 1 + carry 0 = 0 + 0 = 0, 1 carries over&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;0 + 0 + carry 1 = 0 + 1 = 1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;0 + 1 + carry 1 = 1 + 1 = 0, 1 carries over&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;1 + 0 + carry 1 = 1 + 1 = 0, 1 carries over&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;1 + 1 + carry 1 = 0 + 1 = 1, 1 carries over&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This full adder circuit can be stacked to implement full addition of arbitrarily large binary integers; for 4 bits, this may look the following way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/4bit_adder.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other basic arithmetic operations, including incremental counting (a simplified case of always adding +1 to the operand), can be implemented in similar ways - enabling you to build a rudimentary calculator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Memory &lt;a name=&quot;36&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#36&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;36&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essential difference between computers and dumb calculators is the ability to execute programs in a manner first generalized by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Turing_machine&quot;&gt;Alan Turing&lt;/a&gt;. To accomplish this goal, the machine needs not only the ability to perform calculations, but also to select the type of calculation to be made (i.e., enable the appropriate ALU block) in accordance to a stored program - and to save the output of this calculation for later reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several types of digital memory are used today, but the most rudimentary variety is an arrangement of NOR or NAND gates with internal feedback, known as a flip-flop or a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latch_%28electronics%29&quot;&gt;latch&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/memory.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's consider the behavior of the circuit on the left (known as an SR latch):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SET=0 RESET=0 OUT&lt;sub&gt;t-1&lt;/sub&gt;=0 → bottom gate outputs 1, top gate outputs 0, OUT&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;=0 (stable)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;SET=0 RESET=0 OUT&lt;sub&gt;t-1&lt;/sub&gt;=1 → bottom gate outputs 0, top gate outputs 1, OUT&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;=1 (stable)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SET=0 RESET=1 OUT&lt;sub&gt;t-1&lt;/sub&gt;=0 → bottom gate outputs 1, top gate outputs 1, OUT&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;=1 (evolves into the next case)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;SET=0 RESET=1 OUT&lt;sub&gt;t-1&lt;/sub&gt;=1 → bottom gate outputs 0, top gate outputs 0, OUT&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;=0 (stable)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SET=1 RESET=0 OUT&lt;sub&gt;t-1&lt;/sub&gt;=0 → bottom gate outputs 1, top gate outputs 1, OUT&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;=1 (stable)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;SET=1 RESET=0 OUT&lt;sub&gt;t-1&lt;/sub&gt;=1 → bottom gate outputs 0, top gate outputs 0, OUT&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;=0 (evolves into the previous case)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SET=1 RESET=1 OUT&lt;sub&gt;t-1&lt;/sub&gt;=X → unstable oscillation&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important observation is that when SET and RESET are both low, this arrangement of gates retains the previous output value indefinitely; when RESET is high and SET low, it eventually settles on &quot;0&quot; output regardless of the starting state; and that with SET high and RESET low, it always settles on &quot;1&quot;. This circuit can store one bit of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, to minimize the number of inputs and avoid unstable states, the arrangement shown on the right - known as D or gated latch - may be used, instead. In this case, any input value is loaded into the flip-flop when ENABLE is high; and is retained when ENABLE is low. The ENABLE line can be shared across any number of simultaneously accessed flip-flops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Line decoders, multiplexers, demultiplexers &lt;a name=&quot;37&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#37&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;37&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, it is necessary to convert binary numbers to &quot;one out of X&quot; signals; for example, to efficiently address 4 bit memory, a 2-bit binary integer provided by the CPU may be used to decide which flip-flop needs to receive the ENABLE signal (with locations identified as 00, 01, 10, 11). In these cases, a circuit known as a line decoder is commonly used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/decoder.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A slight variation of this circuit is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demultiplexer#Digital_demultiplexers&quot;&gt;demultiplexer&lt;/a&gt; - a device that takes an arbitrary digital input value, and routes it to a specified output pin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/demux.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demultiplexers are particularly useful in communications, where - when controlled by a synchronous binary counter - they can be used to convert &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_communications&quot;&gt;serial data streams&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_communication&quot;&gt;parallel output&lt;/a&gt; stored in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its counterpart, used to serialize parallel data, or to switch between multiple input signals, is known as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexer&quot;&gt;multiplexer&lt;/a&gt;; the circuit is very similar, except for multiple independent data inputs, and one multi-input OR gate providing the output (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Multiplexer_Example01.svg&quot;&gt;schematic&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital conversions &lt;a name=&quot;38&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#38&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;38&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital circuits can, with minimal interfacing, accept most types of binary inputs - and with the use of external power transistors or relays, can also switch arbitrarily large loads. It is more complicated, however, to allow them to generate or sample continuously variable, analog signals. A specialized type of a circuit, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital-to-analog_converter&quot;&gt;digital-to-analog converter&lt;/a&gt; (DAC) is used to accomplish the former task. The most rudimentary type of a DAC is simply a resistor bridge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/dac.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By selecting every resistor to have a different value, it is possible to achieve a distinct output voltage level for any possible input combination - allowing simple conversion of binary numbers to nearly continuous, if slightly quantized (16 values in this case) analog signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_to_digital_converter&quot;&gt;Analog-to-digital converters&lt;/a&gt; (ADC) may be built from such a DAC and a voltage comparator: the circuit may attempt to compare different generated voltage levels to the reference signal, and use the digital input that caused the difference to fall within a threshold as the result of the conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Clocks in digital circuits &lt;a name=&quot;39&quot; href=&quot;http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/#39&quot; class=&quot;slink&quot; id=&quot;39&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All types of digital circuits require some time to respond to changes in input conditions and reach a stable state - a problem especially evident in the case of flip-flops, where a single oscillation will occur for some state transitions before the gates settle in a stable configuration. In addition, many digital operations, such as multiplexing, demultiplexing, or analog-to-digital conversions, or iterative arithmetics (e.g., naive multiplication) require synchronous timing signals to properly coordinate multi-step tasks, enabling and disabling subsequent processing stages as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, almost all modern computers use global clock signals to ensure that all operations are properly synchronized, and all circuits are allowed enough time to reach the expected output state. For example, AND gates may be employed to make sure that the input or output stage is active only when the clock signal is high; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Edge_triggered_D_flip-flop.png&quot;&gt;modified flip-flops&lt;/a&gt; may be used to detect clock signal state transitions and initiate actions on rising or falling edges; and binary counters may be used to ensure that a particular number of clock cycles passes between any two operations, or to select the appropriate part of a circuit to use when executing a sequence of calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clock signals are sometimes divided (with the use of simple synchronous counters) to drive slower output buses while allowing the core processor to run at high speed - anywhere from 100 kHz to several gigahertz is common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While experimental computers not using clocks at all, or using individual non-synchronized clocks for various subsystems, were devised in the past, the extra complexity of doing so made them, at least so far, rather impractical in real-world applications. The same fate met all attempts to build non-binary computers (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_computer&quot;&gt;ternary&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that's all I have for you! A couple extra pointers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you want to learn more about electronics, you should probably consider &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Art-Electronics-Paul-Horowitz/dp/0521370957&quot;&gt;&quot;The Art of Electronics&quot;&lt;/a&gt; by Horowitz and Hill. A more accessible, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/physics/ph235/errata.pdf&quot;&gt;somewhat less accurate&lt;/a&gt; book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071452818&quot;&gt;&quot;Practical Electronics for Inventors&quot;&lt;/a&gt; by Scherz, is probably also a good pick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To experiment with circuit behavior, you should install &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linear.com/designtools/software/ltspice.jsp&quot;&gt;LTspice&lt;/a&gt; or other &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPICE&quot;&gt;SPICE&lt;/a&gt; UI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To order parts, you should check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mouser.com/&quot;&gt;Mouser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For prototyping, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allelectronics.com/make-a-store/item/PB-1680/BREADBOARD-1680-CONTACTS//1.html&quot;&gt;simple breadboard&lt;/a&gt; will come handy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For soldering, you should get a decent soldering station, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Weller-WES51-Analog-Soldering-Station/dp/B000BRC2XU/&quot;&gt;Weller WES51&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For troubleshooting issues, an oscilloscope is indispensable, but can be expensive; some low-cost options include &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rigolna.com/products/digital-oscilloscopes/ds1000e/&quot;&gt;Rigol DS1000E&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.testequipmentdepot.com/bk-precision/oscilloscopes/2530.htm&quot;&gt;BK Precision 2530&lt;/a&gt;. In absence of this, you will need at least a good &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Extech-EX330-Autoranging-Multimeter-Thermometer/dp/B000EX0AE4&quot;&gt;multimeter&lt;/a&gt;, but you will be working in the dark.&lt;/li&gt;

<title>The Shock of Sweden&amp;#039;s Housing Market Is Hitting the Country&amp;#039;s Currency</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Can a central bank steer the housing market?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not so long ago, Sweden’s Riksbank decided: no. Now, there’s a risk that decision may backfire as the biggest property market in Scandinavia risks sinking into a correction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence of price declines was so worrying on Tuesday that it contributed to a 1.5 percent &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/OZEPX66VDKHV&quot; title=&quot;Swedish Inflation Miss, Housing Slump Weigh on Krona Outlook&quot; class=&quot;terminal-news-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;slump in the krona&lt;/a&gt; against the euro. A weak currency puts the Riksbank’s inflation target at risk. So should it be looking at the housing market more closely?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developments in Sweden’s housing market “could spark some doubts at the Riksbank as it may affect the overall economic outlook and inflation,” Nordea analyst Andreas Wallstrom said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-tout-type=&quot;story&quot;&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/OZEEZ96JTSE8&quot; title=&quot;Click for full story&quot; class=&quot;terminal-news-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Read more on housing market here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;lazy-img-320404628&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i3Cw5vQlxrJU/v1/60x-1.png&quot; data-native-src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i3Cw5vQlxrJU/v1/-1x-1.png&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img__image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweden’s Riksbank has thrown all its energy into fighting deflation and, earlier this year, finally regained credibility on its inflation mandate. Policy makers now say they may be ready to start raising rates in the middle of next year. At the same time, the Riksbank may extend a bond purchase program due to end this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/OZ56TF6TTDS0&quot; title=&quot;Riksbank’s Skingsley Can’t Rule Out Need for More Stimulus&quot; class=&quot;terminal-news-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;minutes&lt;/a&gt; of the Riksbank’s latest rate meeting, Deputy Governor Cecilia Skingsley suggested that monetary policy, “under certain circumstances, can be used to combat the effects of major household debt.” She also said the housing market “must be carefully monitored,” given the latest developments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nordea’s Wallstrom says the central bank will probably need to see a “sharp drop” in house prices with a direct impact on the real economy before it will look into adding significant stimulus. But the bank might decided to signal rates will stay where they are for even longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A smaller step for the Riksbank is, however, to pull down the rate path further,” he said. “This could happen already in December.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, even the bank’s inflation targeting efforts are yielding mixed results. The latest data show that Swedish inflation was below the Riksbank’s target in October.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Guide to Natural Language Processing</title>
<link>https://tomassetti.me/guide-natural-language-processing/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://tomassetti.me/guide-natural-language-processing/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;What can you use Natural Language Processing for?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural Language Processing (NLP) comprises a set of techniques that can be used to achieve many different objectives. Take a look at the following table to figure out which technique can solve your particular problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are going to talk about parsing in the general sense of analyzing a document and extracting its meaning.&lt;/strong&gt; So, we are going to talk about actual parsing of natural languages, but we will spend most of the time on other techniques. When it comes to understanding programming languages parsing is the way to go, however you can pick specific alternatives for natural languages. In other words, we are mostly going to talk about what you would use instead of parsing, to accomplish your goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you wanted to find all for statements a programming language file, you would parse it and then count the number of for. Instead, you are probably going to use something like stemming to find all mentions of cats in a natural language document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is necessary because &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language&quot;&gt;the theory&lt;/a&gt; behind the parsing of natural languages might be the same one that is behind the parsing of programming languages, however the practice is very dissimilar. In fact, you are not going to build a parser for a natural language. That is unless you work in artificial intelligence or as researcher. You are even rarely going to use one. Rather you are going to find an algorithm that work a simplified model of the document that can only solve your specific problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, you are going to find tricks to avoid to actually having to parse a natural language. That is why this area of computer science is usually called &lt;strong&gt;natural language processing&lt;/strong&gt; rather than natural language parsing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get the Guide to NLP delivered to your email and read it when you want on the device you want&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Algorithms That Require Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to see specific solutions to each problem. Mind you that these specific solutions can be quite complex themselves. The more advanced they are, the less they rely on simple algorithms. Usually they need a vast database of data about the language. A logical consequence of this is that it is rarely easy to adopt a tool for one language to be used for another one. Or rather, the tool might work with few adaptations, but to build the database would require a lot of investment. So, for example, you would probably find a ready to use tool to create a summary of an English text, but maybe not one for an Italian one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, in this article we concentrate mostly on English language tools. Although we mention if these tools work for other languages. You do not need to know the theoretical differences between languages, such as the number of genders or cases they have. However, you should be aware that the more different a language is from English, the harder would be to apply these techniques or tools to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, you should not expect to find tools that can work with Chinese (or rather the &lt;em&gt;Chinese writing system&lt;/em&gt;). It is not necessarily that these languages are harder to understand programmatically, but there might be less research on them or the methods might be completely different from the ones adopted for English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Structure of This Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is organized according to the tasks we want to accomplish. Which means that the tools and explanation are grouped according to the task they are used for. For instance, there is a section about measuring the properties of a text, such as its difficulty. They are also generally in ascending order of difficulty: it is easier to classify words than entire documents. We start with simple information retrieval techniques and we end in the proper field of natural language processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think it is the most useful way to provide the information you need: you need to do X, we directly show the methods and tools you can use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Table Of Contents&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following table of contents shows the whole content of this guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;classWords&quot;&gt;Classifying Words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the expression classifying words, we intend to include techniques and libraries that group words together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;grouping&quot;&gt;Grouping Similar Words&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to talk about two methods that can group together similar words, for the purpose of information retrieval. Basically, these are methods used to find the documents, with the words we care about, from a pool of all documents. That is useful because if a user search for documents containing the word &lt;code&gt;friend&lt;/code&gt; he is probably equally interested in documents containing &lt;code&gt;friends&lt;/code&gt; and possibly &lt;code&gt;friended&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;friendship&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to be clear, in this section we are not going to talk about methods to group semantically connected words, such as identifying all pets or all English towns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two methods are stemming and division of words into group of characters. The algorithms for the first ones are language dependent, while the ones for the second ones are not. We are going to examine each of them in separate paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;stemming&quot;&gt;Stemming&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stemming is the process of finding the stem, or root, of a word. In this context, the stem is not necessarily the morphological root according to linguists. So, it is not the form of a word that you would find, say, in a vocabulary. For example, an algorithm may produce the stem &lt;code&gt;consol&lt;/code&gt; for the word &lt;code&gt;consoling&lt;/code&gt;. While in a vocabulary as a root you would find &lt;code&gt;console&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical application of stemming is grouping together all instances of words with the same stem for usage in a search library. So, if a user search for documents containing &lt;code&gt;friend&lt;/code&gt; he can also find ones with &lt;code&gt;friends&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;friended&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;porter&quot;&gt;Porter Stemming Algorithm&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about an algorithm that remove suffixes to find the stem: the effective and widely used Porter Stemming Algorithm. The algorithm was originally created by Martin Porter for English. There are also Porter based/inspired algorithms for other languages: such as French or Russian. You can find all of them at the website of &lt;a href=&quot;http://snowballstem.org/algorithms/&quot;&gt;Snowball&lt;/a&gt;. Snowball is a simple language to describe stemming algorithms, but the algorithms are also described in plain English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A complete description of the algorithm is beyond the scope of this guide. However, its foundation is easy to grasp. Fundamentally the algorithm divides a word in regions and then replace or remove certain suffixes, if they are completely contained in said region. So, for example, the Porter2 (i.e., the updated version) algorithm, state that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;1 is the region after the first non-vowel following a vowel, or the end of the word if there is no such non-vowel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then that you should replace &lt;em&gt;-tional&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;-tion&lt;/em&gt;, if it is found inside R1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the word &lt;code&gt;confrontational&lt;/code&gt; has as R1 region &lt;code&gt;-frontational&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-tional&lt;/code&gt; is completely contained in its R1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;so &lt;code&gt;confrontational&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;code&gt;confrontation&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Porter Stemmer is purely algorithmic, it does not rely on an external database or computed rules (i.e., rules created according to a training database). This is a great advantage, because it makes it predictable and easy to implement. The disadvantage is that it cannot handle exceptional cases and known mistakes cannot be easily solved. For example, the algorithm creates the same stem for &lt;code&gt;university&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;universal&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Porter stemmer is not perfect, but it is simple, effective and easy to implement. For a language like English, a stemmer can be realized by any competent developer. So, there are many out there for all notable programming languages and we are not going to list them here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Typical Issues with Other Languages&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most languages that are somewhat close to English, like German or even Romance languages, are generally easy to stem. Actually, the creation of the algorithm itself is complex and requires a great knowledge of the language. However, once somebody has done the hard work of creating an algorithm, implementing one is easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In stemming there are many problems with two kinds of languages you will usually encounter. The first kind is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutinative_language&quot;&gt;agglutinative languages&lt;/a&gt;. Setting aside the linguistic meaning of the expression, the issue is that agglutinative languages pile up prefixes and suffixes on the root of a word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular Turkish is problematic because is both an agglutinative language and a concatenative one. Which mean basically that in Turkish a word can represent a whole English sentence. This makes hard to develop a stemming algorithm for Turkish, but it also makes it less useful. That is because if you stem a Turkish word you might end up with one stem for each sentence, so you lose a lot of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second kind of issue is related to language with no clearly defined words. Chinese is the prime example as a language that has no alphabet, but only symbols that represent concepts. So, stemming has no meaning for Chinese. Even determining the boundaries of concepts is hard. The problem of dividing a text in its component words is called word segmentation. With English you can find the boundaries of words just by looking at whitespace or punctuation. There are no such things in Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;dividing&quot;&gt;Splitting Words&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative method to group together similar words relies on splitting them. The foundation of this method is taking apart words into sequence of characters. These characters are called &lt;em&gt;k-grams&lt;/em&gt;, but they are also known as &lt;em&gt;n-grams characters&lt;/em&gt; (n-grams might also indicate groups of words). The sequence of characters is built in a sliding manner, advancing by one character at each step, starting and ending with a special symbol that indicates the boundaries of the word. For example, the 3-grams for happy are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;$ha&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ppy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;py$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the symbol &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; used to indicate the beginning and the end of the word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact method used for search is beyond the scope of this article. In general terms: you apply the same process to the search term(s) and then compare the occurrences of the k-grams of the input with the one of the words in the documents. Usually you apply a statistical coefficient, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index&quot;&gt;Jaccard coefficient&lt;/a&gt;, to determine how much similar the words have to be to be grouped together (i.e., how many grams have to have in common). For example, with an high coefficient you might group together &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cats&lt;/code&gt; or divide &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;catty&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note a couple of things: the order of the k-grams and spelling mistakes. The order of the k-grams does not matter, in theory you could have completely different words that happens to have the same k-grams. In practice, this does not happen. This method is imprecise, which means that it can also protect from spelling mistakes of the user. For example, even if the user input &lt;code&gt;locamotive&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;locomotive&lt;/code&gt;, it will probably still show the correct results. That is because 7 of 10 3-grams matches; exact matches would rank higher, but the words locamotive does not exist and so it probably has no matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Limits and Effectiveness&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great advantage of this technique is that it is not just purely algorithmic and very simple, but it works with all languages. You do not need to build k-grams for English differently from the ones for French. You just take apart the words in the same way. Although it is important to note that the effectiveness is in the details: you have to pick the right number of &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt; to have the best results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ideal number depends on the average length of the word in the language: it should be lower or equal than that. Different languages might have different values, but in general you can get away with 4 or 5. You will not have the absolute best results with only one choice, but it will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disadvantage is that it looks extremely stupid, let’s face it: it so simple that it should not work. But it actually does, &lt;a href=&quot;https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.derijke/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/hollink-monolingual-2004.pdf&quot;&gt;it works well if not better than stemming (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;. It is shamelessly effective, and it has many other uses. We are going to see one right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Generating Names&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general case of generating fake words that looks like real words is hard and of limited use. You could create phrases for a fake language, but that is pretty much it. However, it is possible to programmatically create realistic fake names for use in games or for any world building need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several feasible methods. The easiest works roughly like that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;create a database of names of the same kind you want to generate (e.g., Roman names, Space Lizards Names, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;divide the input names in k-grams (e.g., 3-grams of Mark -&amp;gt; $ma – mar – ark – rk$)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;associate a probability to the k-grams: the more frequently they appear in the original database, the higher the chance they appear in the generated name)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;generate the new names&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many variants, for instance you could combine a different number of k-grams for special purposes (e.g., all names start with a 2-gram, but end in a 4-gram).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also improve the soundness of the generated names, simply by looking at the probabilities of the sequences appearing in a certain order. For example, if you randomly start with &lt;code&gt;ar&lt;/code&gt; the following syllable might be more likely &lt;code&gt;th&lt;/code&gt; than &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method is not perfect, but it generally works good enough. You can see a few simple examples in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ftomassetti/langgen&quot;&gt;langgen&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Valkryst/VNameGenerator&quot;&gt;VNameGenerator&lt;/a&gt;, which shows variations of said method and a few others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;classDocs&quot;&gt;Classifying Documents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section we include techniques and libraries that measure and identifies documents. For example, they can detect the language in which a document is written or measure how difficult it is to read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;measuring&quot;&gt;Text Metrics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two popular metrics of a text that can be easily implemented: reading time and difficulty of the text. These measurements are useful to inform the reader or to help the writer checking that the document respects certain criteria, such as being accessible to a young audience (i.e., low difficulty).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;readingTime&quot;&gt;Reading Time&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest way of measuring the reading time of a text is to calculate the words in the document, and then divide them by a predefined &lt;em&gt;words per minute&lt;/em&gt; (wpm) number. The words per minute figure represent the words read by an average reader in a minute. So, if a text has 1000 words and the &lt;em&gt;wpm&lt;/em&gt; is set to 200, the text would take 5 minutes to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is easy to understand and easy to implement. The catch is that you have to pick the correct wpm rate and that the rate varies according to each language. For example, English readers might read 230 wpm, but French readers might instead read 200 wpm. This is related to the length of the words and the natural flow of the language (i.e., a language could be more concise than another, for instance it might frequently omit subjects).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first issue is easily solved: for English most estimates put the correct wpm between 200 and 230. However, there is still the problem of dealing with different languages. This requires to have the correct data for each language and to be able to understand the language in which a text is written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To mitigate both problems you might opt to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2166061&quot;&gt;a measurement of characters count&lt;/a&gt; in order to estimate the reading time. Basically, you remove the punctuation and spaces, then count the characters and divide the sum by 900-1000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On linguistic grounds the measure makes less sense, since people do not read single characters. However, the difference between languages are less evident by counting characters. For example, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutinative_language&quot;&gt;agglutinative language&lt;/a&gt; might have very long words, and thus fewer of them. So it ends up with a similar number of characters to a fusional language like English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works better because the differences in speed of reading characters in each language is smaller as a percentage of the total speed. Imagine for example that the typical reader of English can read 200 wpm and 950 cpm, while the typical reader of French can read 250 wpm and 1000 cpm. The absolute difference is the same, but it is less relevant for reading characters. Of course, this is still less than ideal, but it is a simple solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither of the measure consider the difficulty of the text. That texts that are difficult to read take more time to read, even with the same number of words or characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;readability&quot;&gt;Calculating the Readability of a Text&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually the calculation of the readability of a text is linked to grades of education (i.e., years of schooling). So, an easy text might be one that can be read by 4th graders, while a harder one might need a 10th grade education. That is both a byproduct of the fact that the algorithms were created for educational purposes and because education is a useful anchor for ranking difficulty. Saying that a text is difficult in absolute terms is somewhat meaningless, saying that it is difficult for 7th-graders makes more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several formulas, but they are generally all based on the number of words and sentences in addition to either syllables or the number of difficult words. Let’s see two of the most famous: Flesch-Kincaid and Dale–Chall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these formulas is perfect, but both have been scientifically tested. The only caveat is that they should be used only for checking and not as a guideline. They work if you write normally. If you try to edit a text to lower the score, the results might be incorrect. For example, &lt;em&gt;if you use short words just to make a text seem easy, it looks bad&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Flesch-Kincaid Readability Formula&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two variants of this formula: &lt;em&gt;Flesch reading ease&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Flesch–Kincaid grade level&lt;/em&gt;. They are equivalent, but one output a score (the higher it is, the easier is the text) and the other a corresponding US grade level. We are going to show the first one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3786&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/tomassetti.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/flesch.png?resize=800%2C60&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; alt=&quot;Flesch Reading Ease&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/tomassetti.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/flesch.png?w=800&amp;amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/tomassetti.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/flesch.png?resize=300%2C23&amp;amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/tomassetti.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/flesch.png?resize=768%2C58&amp;amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/tomassetti.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/flesch.png?resize=705%2C53&amp;amp;ssl=1 705w, https://i0.wp.com/tomassetti.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/flesch.png?resize=450%2C34&amp;amp;ssl=1 450w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;The readability is generally between 100 to 20. A result of 100 indicates a document that can be easily understood by a 11-years old student, while a result of 30 or less indicates a document suited for university graduates. You can find a more complete explanation and ranking table in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mang.canterbury.ac.nz/writing_guide/writing/flesch.shtml&quot;&gt;How to Write Plain English&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The different parameters can be obtained easily. Only calculating the total number of syllables requires a significant amount of work. The good news is that it is actually doable and there is a reliable algorithm for it. The bad news is that the author of TeX (Frank Liang) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tug.org/docs/liang/&quot;&gt;wrote his PhD thesis about his hyphenation algorithm&lt;/a&gt;. You can find an implementation and an accessible explanation of the algorithm in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mnater/Hyphenopoly&quot;&gt;Hyphenopoly.js&lt;/a&gt;. The two problems are equivalent, since you can only divide a word in two parts between two syllables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative is to use a hack: instead of calculating syllables, count the vowels. This hack has been reporting to work for English, but it is not applicable to other languages. Although if you use it you lose the scientific validity of the formula and you just get a somewhat accurate number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general structure of the formula has been applied to other languages (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Vacca#Indice_di_leggibilit.C3.A0_Flesch-Vacca&quot;&gt;Flesch-Vacca for Italian&lt;/a&gt;), but each language have different coefficients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Dale–Chall Readability Formula&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This formula relies also on the number of words and sentences, but instead of syllables it uses the number of difficult words present in the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A difficult word is defined as one that do not belong to a list of 3000 simple words, that 80% of fourth graders understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3785 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/tomassetti.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dale-chall.png?resize=800%2C60&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; alt=&quot;Dale-Chall Readability Formula&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/tomassetti.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dale-chall.png?w=800&amp;amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/tomassetti.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dale-chall.png?resize=300%2C23&amp;amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/tomassetti.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dale-chall.png?resize=768%2C58&amp;amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/tomassetti.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dale-chall.png?resize=705%2C53&amp;amp;ssl=1 705w, https://i0.wp.com/tomassetti.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dale-chall.png?resize=450%2C34&amp;amp;ssl=1 450w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;Thus, the formula is easy to use and calculate. The only inconvenience is that you have to maintain a database of these 3000 words. We are not aware of the formula having been adapted to languages other than English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formula generally output a score between 4 and 10. Less than 5 indicates a text suitable for 4th graders, a result of 9 or more indicates a text for college students. You can find a complete table of results at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.readabilityformulas.com/new-dale-chall-readability-formula.php&quot;&gt;The New Dale-Chall Readability Formula&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is natural to think that you could modify the formula, to calculate the difficulty in understanding a specialized text. That is to say you could define difficult words as words belonging to technical terminology. For example, you could calculate how difficult would be to understand a text for an average person, according to how much computer jargon it contains. Words like &lt;em&gt;parser&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;compiler&lt;/em&gt; could be difficult, while &lt;em&gt;computer&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;mouse&lt;/em&gt; could be considered easy. This might work: however you would have to calculate the correct coefficients yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Identifying a Language&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you need to work with a natural language document the need to identifying a language comes up often. For starters, almost all the algorithms we have seen works only on a specific language and not all of them. Even overcoming this problem it is useful to be able to understand in which language is written a certain document. For instance, so that you can show or hide a document to certain users based on the language it understand. Imagine that a user search for documents containing the word &lt;code&gt;computer&lt;/code&gt;: if you simply return all documents that contain that word you will get results even in languages other than English. That is because the word has been adopted by other languages (e.g., Italian).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliable language identification can be achieved with statistical methods. We are going to talk about two methods: a vocabulary based one and one based on frequencies of groups of letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory you could also hack together ad-hoc methods based on language clues, such as the one listed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Language_recognition_chart&quot;&gt;Wikipedia:Language recognition chart&lt;/a&gt;. And then come up with a ranking method to order the probability of each language. The advantage of this approach is that you would not need any database. However, it has not been tested scientifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, two features of Italian are: most words end with a vowel and the word &lt;code&gt;è&lt;/code&gt; (i.e., is) is quite common. So you could check for the presence and frequencies of these features in a certain document and use them to calculate the probability that said document were in Italian (e.g., at least 70% of the words ends in vowel -&amp;gt; +50% chance that the document is in Italian; the word &lt;code&gt;è&lt;/code&gt; is present in at least 10% phrases -&amp;gt; +50% chance that the document is in Italian).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Words in a Vocabulary&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A basic method consists in comparing words in the text with the ones included in a vocabulary. First, you get a vocabulary of each language you care about. Then, you compare the text with the words in each vocabulary and count the number of occurrences. The vocabulary which includes the highest number of words denotes the language of the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the following phrase: &lt;code&gt;the cat was in the boudoir&lt;/code&gt;, would be identified as English because there are 5 English words (&lt;code&gt;the&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;was&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;the&lt;/code&gt;) and 1 French word (&lt;code&gt;boudoir&lt;/code&gt;). In case you are wondering, a boudoir is essentially a female version of a man cave, but for sophisticated people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its simplicity this method works well for large documents, but not so much for Twitter-like texts: texts that are short and frequently contains errors. The author of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/peterc/whatlanguage&quot;&gt;Whatlanguage&lt;/a&gt; library, which implements this method, suggest a minimum of 10 words for reliable identification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Frequencies of Groups of Letters&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most currently used technique relies on building language models of the frequencies of groups of letters. We are again talking about k-grams, that have to be analyzed for each language. We are going to describe the procedure outlined by the original paper &lt;a href=&quot;http://odur.let.rug.nl/~vannoord/TextCat/textcat.pdf&quot;&gt;N-Gram-Based Text Categorization (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;, although an implementation might adopt a slight variation of it. Two well-known libraries implementing this method are: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wikimedia/wikimedia-textcat&quot;&gt;the PHP TextCat library by Wikimedia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ivanakcheurov/ntextcat&quot;&gt;NTextCat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we are going to build a model for a language and then we are going to use it for scoring a document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Building a Language Model&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create such language models, you need to have a large set of documents for each language. You divide the words in these documents to find the most used k-grams. The paper suggests calculating the number of k-grams for k from 1 to 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have the frequencies of k-grams, you order them in descending order to build a language model. For instance, a language model for English might have &lt;code&gt;th&lt;/code&gt; in first place, &lt;code&gt;ing&lt;/code&gt; in second and so on. In this final stage the actual number of occurrences it is not relevant, only their final ranking in frequency. That is to say the fact that &lt;code&gt;th&lt;/code&gt; might appear 2648 or 5895 times depends only on the size of your set of documents and it is irrelevant for the success of the method. What it is relevant is just the relative frequency in your set of documents and thus the respective ranking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have build this language model you can use it to identify the language in which a document is written. You just have to apply the same procedure to build a document model of the text that you are trying to identify. So, you end up with a ranking of the frequencies of k-gram in the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, you calculate the differences between the rankings in the document and the ones for each language model you have. You could calculate this distance metric with many statistical formulas, but the paper uses a simple out-of-place method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Scoring Languages&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The method consists of comparing the position in each language model. For each position, you add a number equivalent to the differences of ranks between each language model and the document model. For example, if the language model for English put &lt;code&gt;th&lt;/code&gt; in first place, but the document model for the document that we are classifying put it in 6th place you add 5 to the English score. At the end of the process, the language with the lowest score should be the language of the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, you do not compare all positions of k-grams up to the last one, because the lower you go the more the position becomes somewhat arbitrary. It will depend on the particular set of documents you will have chosen to build a language model. The paper uses a limit of 300 positions, but it also says that it depends on the short length of the documents the scientists have chosen. So, you would have to find the best limit for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also the chance of wrongly classifying a text. This is more probable if a text is written in a language for which there is no model. In that case the algorithm might wrongly classify the text as one belonging to a language close to the real one. That could happen because the method find a language that has a good enough score for the document. The real language would have scored better , but it is not available, so the good enough score wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you have a model for Italian, but do not have one for Spanish, your software might classify a Spanish text as an Italian one because Italian is similar enough to Spanish and the closest you have to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem can be mitigated by using a proper threshold. That is to say a match is found only if the input has a low score (compared to its length) for a language. Of course, now you have the problem of finding such proper threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Limitations&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method works better with short texts, but it is not perfect. The suggested limit is based on the implementation and the quality of text and model. For example, NTextCat recommends a limit of 5 words. Generally speaking this method would not work reliably for Twitter messages or similar short and frequently incorrect texts. However, that would be true even for a human expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;understandingDocs&quot;&gt;Understanding Documents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section contains more advanced libraries to understand documents. We use the term somewhat loosely: we talk about how a computer can extract or manage the content of a document beyond simple manipulation of words and characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to see how you can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;generate summary of a document (i.e., an algorithmic answer to the question what is this article about?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sentiment analysis (i.e., does this document contain a positive or negative opinion?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;parsing a document written in a natural language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;translate a document in another language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the methods listed in the previous sections you could build a library yourself with a reasonable effort. From now on, it will get harder. That is because they might require vast amount of annotated data (e.g., a vocabulary having each word with the corresponding part of speech) or rely on complex machine learning methods. So, we will mostly suggest using libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an area with many open problems and active research, so you could find most libraries in Python, a language adopted by the research community. Though you could find the occasional research-ready library in another language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final introductory note is that statistics and machine learning are the current kings of natural language processing. So there is probably somebody trying to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tensorflow.org/&quot;&gt;TensorFlow&lt;/a&gt; to accomplish each of these tasks (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hengluchang/deep-news-summarization&quot;&gt;deep news summarization&lt;/a&gt;). You might try that too, if you take in account a considerable amount of time for research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;summaries&quot;&gt;Generation of Summaries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creation of a summary, or a headline, to correctly represent the meaning of a document it is achievable with several methods. Some of them rely on information retrieval techniques, while others are more advanced. The theory is also divided in two strategies: extracting sentences or parts thereof from the original text, generating abstract summaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second strategy it is still an open area of research, so we will concentrate on the first one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;sumBasic&quot;&gt;SumBasic&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SumBasic is a method that relies on the probability of individual words being present in a sentence to determine the most representative sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;First, you have to account the number of times a word appears in the whole document. With that you calculate the probability of each word appearing in the document. I.e., if the word appears 5 times and the document has 525 words its probability is 5/525.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You calculate a weight for each sentence that is the average of the probabilities of all the words in the sentence. I.e., if a sentence contains three words with probability 3/525, 5/525 and 10/525, the weight would be 6/525.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally you score the sentences by multiplying the highest probability word of each sentence with its weight. I.e., a sentence with a weight of 0.1 and whose best word had the probability of 0.5 would score 0.1 * 0. 5 = 0.05, while another one with weight 0.2 and a word with probability 0.4 would score 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having found the best sentence, you recalculate the probabilities for each word in the chosen sentence. You recalculate the probabilities as if the chosen sentence was removed from the document. The idea is that the included sentence already contains a part of the whole meaning of the document. So that part become less important and this helps avoiding excessive repetition. You repeat the process until you reach the needed summary length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technique is quite simple. It does not require to have a database of documents to build a general probability of a word appearing in any document. You just need to calculate the probabilities in each input document. However, for this to work you have to exclude what are called &lt;em&gt;stopwords&lt;/em&gt;. These are common words present in most documents, such as &lt;code&gt;the&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt;. Otherwise you might include meaningless sentences that include lots of them. You could also include stemming to improve the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was first described in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.middlebury.edu/~mpettit/tr-2005-101.pdf&quot;&gt;The Impact of Frequency on Summarization (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;; there is an implementation available as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/EthanMacdonald/SumBasic&quot;&gt;a Python library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach based on frequencies is an old and popular one, because it is generally effective and simple to implement. SumBasic is good enough that is frequently used as a baseline in the literature. However, there are even simpler methods. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/neopunisher/Open-Text-Summarizer&quot;&gt;Open Text Summarizer&lt;/a&gt; is a 2003 library that uses an even simpler approach. Basically you count the frequency of each word, then you exclude the common English words (e.g., &lt;code&gt;the&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt;) and finally you calculate the score of a sentence according to the frequencies of the word it contains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;graphMethods&quot;&gt;Graph-based Methods: TextRank&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more complex methods of calculating the relevance of the individual sentences. A couple of them take inspiration from PageRank: they are called LexRank and TextRank. They both rely on the relationship between different sentences to obtain a more sophisticate measurement of the importance of sentences, but they differ in the way they calculate similarity of sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PageRank measures the importance of a document according to the importance of other documents that links to it. The importance of each document, and thus each link, is computed recursively until a balance is reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TextRank works on the same principle: the relationship between elements can be used to understand the importance of each individual element. TextRank actually uses a more complex formula than the original PageRank algorithm, because a link can be only present or not, while textual connections might be partially present. For instance, you might calculate that two sentences containing different words with the same stem (e.g., &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cats&lt;/code&gt; both have &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; as their stem) are only partially related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original paper describes a generic approach, rather than a specific method. In fact, it also describes two applications: keyword extraction and summarization. The key differences are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the units you choose as a foundation of the relationship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the way you calculate the connection and its strength&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, you might choose as units n-grams of words or whole phrases. N-grams of words are sequences of n words, computed the same way you do k-gram for characters. So, for the phrase &lt;code&gt;dogs are better than cats&lt;/code&gt;, there are these 3-grams:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;dogs are better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are better than&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;better than cats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phrases might create weighted links according to how similar they are. Or they might simply create links according to the position they are (i.e., a phrase might link to the previous and following one). The method works the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;TextRank for Sentence Extraction&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TextRank for extracting phrases uses as a unit whole sentences, and as a similarity measure the number of words in common between them. So, if two phrases contain the words &lt;code&gt;tornado&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;center&lt;/code&gt; they are more similar than if they contain only two common words. The similarity is normalized based on the length of the phrases. To avoid the issue of having longer phrases having higher similarity than shorter ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words used for the similarity measure could be stemmed. Stopwords are usually excluded by the calculation. A further improvement could be to also exclude verbs, although that might be complicated if you do not already have a way to identify the parts of speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LexRank differs mainly because as a similarity measure it uses a standard TF-IDF (Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency). Basically with TF-IDF the value of individual words is first weighted according to how frequently they appear in all documents and in each specific document. For example, if you are summarizing articles for a car magazine, there will be a lot of occurrences of the word &lt;code&gt;car&lt;/code&gt; in every document. So, the word &lt;code&gt;car&lt;/code&gt; would be of little relevance for each document. However, the word &lt;code&gt;explosion&lt;/code&gt; would appear in few documents (hopefully), so it will matter more in each document it appears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.eecs.umich.edu/%7Emihalcea/papers/mihalcea.emnlp04.pdf&quot;&gt;TextRank: Bringing Order into Texts (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; describe the approach. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jjangsangy/ExplainToMe&quot;&gt;ExplainToMe&lt;/a&gt; contains a Python implementation of TextRank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;lsa&quot;&gt;Latent Semantic Analysis&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The methods we have seen so far have a weakness: they do not take into account semantics. This weakness is evident when you consider that there are words that have similar meanings (i.e., synonyms) and that most words can have different meaning depending on the context (i.e., polysemy).  &lt;em&gt;Latent Semantic Analysis&lt;/em&gt; attempt to overcome these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expression &lt;em&gt;Latent Semantic Analysis&lt;/em&gt; describes a technique more than a specific method. A technique that could be useful whenever you need to represent the meaning of words. It can be used for summarization, but also for search purposes, to find words like the query of the user. For instance, if the user search for &lt;code&gt;happiness&lt;/code&gt; a search library using LSA could also return results for &lt;code&gt;joy&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;A Simple Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specific mathematical formulas are a bit complex and involve matrices and operations on them. However, the founding idea is quite simple: words with similar meaning will appear in similar parts of a text. So you start with a normal TF-IDF matrix. Such matrix contains nothing else than the frequencies of individual words, both inside a specific document and in all the documents evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that we want to find a relation between words that do not necessarily appear together. For example, imagine that different documents contain phrases containing the words &lt;code&gt;joy&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;happiness&lt;/code&gt; together other words &lt;code&gt;cookie&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;chocolate&lt;/code&gt;. The words do not appear in the same sentence, but they appear in the same document. One document contains a certain number of such phrases: &lt;code&gt;a dog create happiness&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;dogs bring joy to children&lt;/code&gt;. For this document, LSA should be able to find a connection between &lt;code&gt;joy&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;happiness&lt;/code&gt; through their mutual connection with &lt;code&gt;dog&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The connection is build based on the frequency the words appear together or with related words in the whole set of documents. This allows to build connection even in a sentence or document where they do not appear together. So if &lt;code&gt;joy&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;happiness&lt;/code&gt; appears frequently with &lt;code&gt;dog&lt;/code&gt;, LSA would associate the specific document with the words (&lt;code&gt;joy&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;happiness&lt;/code&gt;) and &lt;code&gt;dog&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, this technique will transform the original matrix from one linking each term with its frequency, into one with a (weighted) combination of terms linked to each document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue is that there are a lot of words, and combinations thereof, so you need to make a lot of calculation and simplifications. And that is where the complex math is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have this matrix, the world is your oyster. That is to say you could use this measurement of meaning in any number of ways. For instance, you could find the most relevant phrase and then find the phrases with are most close to it, using a graph-based method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226424326_Text_Summarization_and_Singular_Value_Decomposition&quot;&gt;Text Summarization and Singular Value Decomposition&lt;/a&gt; describes one way to find the best sentences. The Python library &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/miso-belica/sumy&quot;&gt;sumy&lt;/a&gt; offers an implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;otherMethods&quot;&gt;Other Methods and Libraries&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creation of summaries is a fertile area of research with many valid methods already devised. In fact, much more than the ones we have described here. They vary for the approaches and the objective they are designed for. For example, some are created specifically to provide an answer to a question of the user, others to summarize multiple documents, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read a brief taxonomy of other methods in &lt;a href=&quot;http://textmining.zcu.cz/publications/Z08.pdf&quot;&gt;Automatic Text Summarization (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;. The Python library &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/miso-belica/sumy&quot;&gt;sumy&lt;/a&gt;, that we have already mentioned, implements several methods, though not necessarily the ones mentioned in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sourceforge.net/projects/classifier4j/&quot;&gt;Classifier4J&lt;/a&gt; (Java), &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourceforge.net/projects/nclassifier/&quot;&gt;NClassifier&lt;/a&gt; (C#) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thavelick/summarize/&quot;&gt;Summarize&lt;/a&gt; (Python) implements a Bayes classifier in an algorithm described as such:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to summarize a document this algorithm first determines the frequencies of the words in the document. It then splits the document into a series of sentences. Then it creates a summary by including the first sentence that includes each of the most frequent words. Finally summary’s sentences are reordered to reflect that of those in the original document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thavelick/summarize/blob/master/summarize.py&quot;&gt;Summarize.py&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These projects that implements a Bayes classifier are all dead, but they are useful to understand how the method could be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DataTeaser/textteaser&quot;&gt;DataTeaser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/xiaoxu193/PyTeaser&quot;&gt;PyTeaser&lt;/a&gt; (both in Python, but originally DataTeaser was in Scala) use a custom approach that combines several simple measurements to create a summary of an article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;otherApps&quot;&gt;Other Uses&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can apply the same techniques employed to create summaries to different tasks. That is particularly true for the more advanced and semantic based ones. Notice that the creation of only one summary for many documents is also a different task. That is because you have to take in account different documents lengths and avoid the repetitions, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A natural application is the identification of similar documents. If you can devise a method to identify the most meaningful sentences of one document, you can also compare the meaning of two documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another objective with common techniques is information retrieval. In short, if a user search for one word, say &lt;code&gt;car&lt;/code&gt;, you could use some of these techniques to find documents containing also &lt;code&gt;automobile&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is &lt;em&gt;topic modelling&lt;/em&gt;, which consists in finding the topics of a collection of documents. In simple terms, it means grouping together words with similar themes. It uses more complex statistical methods that the one used for the creation of summaries. The current state of art is based upon a method called Latent Dirichlet allocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/index.html&quot;&gt;Gensim&lt;/a&gt; is a very popular and production-ready library, that have many such applications. Naturally is written in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/&quot;&gt;Mallet&lt;/a&gt; is a Java library mainly designed for topic modelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;parsing&quot;&gt;Parsing Documents&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most computer languages are easy to parse. This is not true for natural languages. There are approaches that give good results, but ultimately this is still an open area of research. Fundamentally the issue is that the parsing a sentence (i.e., analyzing its syntax) and its meaning are interconnected in a natural language. A subject or a verb, a noun or an adverb are all words and most words that can be subject can also be object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, this means that there are no ready to use libraries that are good for every use you can think of. We present some libraries that can be used for restricted tasks, such as recognizing parts of speech, that can also be of use for improving other methods, like the ones for creation of summaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also the frustrating fact is that a lot of software is made by academic researchers. Which means that it could be easily abandoned for another approach or lacking documentation. You cannot really use a work-in-progress, badly maintained software for anything productive. Especially if you care about a language other than English, you might find yourself seeing a good working demo, which was written ten years ago, by somebody with no contact information and without any open source code available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;needData&quot;&gt;You Need Data&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve any kind of result with parsing, or generally extracting information from a natural language document, you need a lot of data to train the algorithms. This group of data is called a &lt;em&gt;corpus&lt;/em&gt;. For use in a system that uses statistical or machine learning techniques, you might just need a lot of real world data possibly divided in the proper groups (e.g., Wikipedia articles divided by category).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you are using a smart system, you might need this corpus of data to be manually constructed or annotated (e.g., the word &lt;code&gt;dog&lt;/code&gt; is a noun that has these X possible meanings). A smart system is one that tries to imitate human understanding, or at a least that uses a process that can be followed by humans. For instance, a parser that relies on a grammar which uses rules such as &lt;code&gt;Phrase → Subject Verb&lt;/code&gt; (read: a phrase is made of a subject and a verb), but also defines several classes of verbs that humans would not normally use (e.g., verbs related to motion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these cases, the corpus often uses a custom format and is built for specific needs. For example, this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ml/geo.html&quot;&gt;system that can answer geographical questions about United States&lt;/a&gt; uses information stored in a Prolog format. The natural consequence is that even what is generally available information, such as dictionary data, can be incompatible between different programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there are also good databases that are so valuable that many programs are built around them. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordNet&quot;&gt;WordNet&lt;/a&gt; is an example of such database. It is a lexical database that links groups of words with similar meaning (i.e., synonyms) with their associated definition. It works thus as both a dictionary and a thesaurus. The original version is for English, but it has inspired similar databases for other languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;things&quot;&gt;What You Can Do&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have presented some of the practical challenges to build your own library to understand text. And we have not even mentioned all the issues related to ambiguity of human languages. So differently from what we did for past sections we are just going to explain what you can do. We are not going to explain the algorithms used to realized them, both because there is no space and also without the necessary data they would be worthless. Instead in the next paragraph we are just going to introduce the most used libraries that you can use to achieve what you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Named-entity Recognition&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Named-entity recognition basically means finding the entities mentioned in the document. For example, in the phrase &lt;code&gt;John Smith is going to Italy&lt;/code&gt;, it should identify &lt;code&gt;John Smith&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Italy&lt;/code&gt; as entities. It should also be able to correctly keep track of them in different documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Sentiment Analysis&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sentiment analysis classifies the sentiment represented by a phrase. In the most basic terms, it means understanding if a phrase indicates a positive or negative statement. A naive Bayes classifier can suffice for this level of understanding. It works in a similar way a spam filter works: it divides the messages into two categories (i.e., spam and non-spam) relying on the probability of each word being present in any of the two categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative is to manually associate an emotional ranking to a word. For example, a value between -10/-5 and 0 for &lt;code&gt;catastrophic&lt;/code&gt; and one between 0 and 5/10 for &lt;code&gt;nice&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need a subtler evaluation you need to resort to machine learning techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Parts of Speech Tagging&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parts of Speech Tagging (usually abbreviated as POS-tagging) indicates the identification and labelling of the different parts of speech (e.g., what is a noun, verb, adjective, etc.). While is an integral part of parsing, it can also be used to simplify other tasks. For instance, it can be used in the creation of summaries to simplify the sentences chosen for the summary (e.g., removing subordinates’ clauses).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Lemmatizer&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lemmatizer return the lemma for a given word and a part of speech tag. Basically, it gives the corresponding dictionary form of a word. In some ways it can be considered an advanced form of a stemmer. It can also be used for similar purposes, namely it can ensure that all different forms of a word are correctly linked to the same concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, it can transform all instances of &lt;code&gt;cats&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;, for search purposes. However, it can also distinguish between the cases of &lt;code&gt;run&lt;/code&gt; as in the verb &lt;code&gt;to run&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;run&lt;/code&gt; as in the noun synonym of a &lt;code&gt;jog&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Chunking&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parts of speech tagging can be considered equivalent to lexing in natural languages. Chunking, also known as shallow parsing, is a step above parts of speech tagging, but one below the final parsing. It connects parts of speech in higher units of meaning, for example complements. Imagine the phrase &lt;code&gt;John always wins our matches of Russian roulette&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a POS-tagger identifies that Russian is an adjective and roulette a noun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a chunker groups together &lt;code&gt;(of) Russian roulette&lt;/code&gt; as a complement or two related parts of speech&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chunker might work to produce units that are going to be used by a parser. It can also work independently, for example to help in named-entity recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Parsing&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result is the same as for computer languages: &lt;a href=&quot;https://tomassetti.me/guide-parsing-algorithms-terminology/#parsingTree&quot;&gt;a parse tree&lt;/a&gt;. Though the process is quite different, and it might start with a probabilistic grammar or even with no grammar at all. It also usually continues with a lot of probabilities and statistical methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a parse tree created by the Stanford Parser (we are going to see it later) for the phrase &lt;code&gt;My dog likes hunting cats and people&lt;/code&gt;. Groups of letters such as NP indicates parts of speech or complements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Translation&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current best methods for automatic machine translation rely on machine learning. The good news is that this means you just need a great number of documents in the languages you care about, without any annotation. Typical sources of such texts are Wikipedia and the official documentation of the European Union (which requires documents to be translated in all the official languages of the Union).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As anybody that have tried Google Translate or Bing Translator can attest, the results are generally good enough for understanding, but still often a bit off. They cannot substitute a human translator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;libraries&quot;&gt;The Best Libraries Available&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following libraries can be used for multiple purposes, so we are going to divide this section by the title of the libraries. Most of them are in Python or Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Apache OpenNLP&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://opennlp.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Apache OpenNLP&lt;/a&gt; library is a machine learning based toolkit for the processing of natural language text. It supports the most common NLP tasks, such as tokenization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity extraction, chunking, parsing, and coreference resolution. These tasks are usually required to build more advanced text processing services. OpenNLP also included maximum entropy and perceptron based machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apache OpenNLP is a Java library with an &lt;a href=&quot;http://opennlp.apache.org/docs/1.8.1/manual/opennlp.html&quot;&gt;excellent documentation&lt;/a&gt; that can fulfill most of the tasks we have just discussed, except for sentiment analysis and translation. The developers provide &lt;a href=&quot;http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/models-1.5/&quot;&gt;language models for a few languages in addition to English&lt;/a&gt;, the most notable are German, Spanish and Portuguese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Classical Language Toolkit&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://cltk.org/&quot;&gt;Classical Language Toolkit (CLTK)&lt;/a&gt; offers natural language processing (NLP) support for the languages of Ancient, Classical, and Medieval Eurasia. Greek and Latin functionality are currently most complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name implies the major feature of the Classical Language Toolkit is the support for classical (ancient) languages, such as Greek and Latin. It has basic NLP tools, such as a lemmatizer, but also indispensable tools to work with ancient languages, such as transliteration support, and peculiar things like &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.cltk.org/en/latest/latin.html#clausulae-analysis&quot;&gt;Clausulae Analysis&lt;/a&gt;. It has a good documentation and it is your only choice for ancient languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;FreeLing&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/freeling/&quot;&gt;FreeLing&lt;/a&gt; is a C++ library providing language analysis functionalities (morphological analysis, named entity detection, PoS-tagging, parsing, Word Sense Disambiguation, Semantic Role Labelling, etc.) for a variety of languages (English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French, German, Russian, Catalan, Galician, Croatian, Slovene, among others).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a library with a good documentation and even a &lt;a href=&quot;http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/freeling/demo/demo.php&quot;&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt;. It supports many languages usually excluded by other tools, but it is released the Affero GPL which is probably the least user-friendly license ever conceived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Moses&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.statmt.org/moses/index.php?n=Main.HomePage&quot;&gt;Moses&lt;/a&gt; is a statistical machine translation system that allows you to automatically train translation models for any language pair. All you need is a collection of translated texts (parallel corpus). Once you have a trained model, an efficient search algorithm quickly finds the highest probability translation among the exponential number of choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing to add is that the system is written in C++ and there is ample documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;NLTK&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries, and an active discussion forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is probably the most known NLP library for Python. The library can accomplish many tasks in different ways (i.e., using different algorithms). It even has a good documentation (if you include the freely available book).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put: it is the standard library for NLP research. Though one issue that some people have is exactly that: it is designed for research and educational purposes. If there are ten ways to do something NLTK would allow you to choose among them all. The intended user is a person with a deep understanding of NLP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/index.html&quot;&gt;TextBlob&lt;/a&gt; is a library that builds upon NLTK (and Pattern) to simplify processing of textual data. The library also provides translation, but it does not implement it directly: it is simply an interface for Google Translate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Pattern&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clips/pattern&quot;&gt;Pattern&lt;/a&gt; is the most peculiar software in our collection because it is a collection of Python libraries for web mining. It has support for data mining from services such as Google and Twitter (i.e., it provide functions to directly search from Google/Twitter) , an HTML parser and many other things. Among these things there is natural language processing for English and a few other languages, including German, Spanish, French and Italian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though English support is more advanced than the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pattern.en module contains a fast part-of-speech tagger for English (identifies nouns, adjectives, verbs, etc. in a sentence), sentiment analysis, tools for English verb conjugation and noun singularization &amp;amp; pluralization, and a WordNet interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the libraries can only support POS-tagging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Polyglot&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://polyglot-nlp.com/&quot;&gt;Polyglot&lt;/a&gt; is a set of NLP libraries for many natural languages in Python. It looks great, although it has only little documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It supports fewer languages for the more advanced tasks, such as POS tagging (16) or named entity recognition (40). However, for sentiment analysis and language identification can work with more than a hundred of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Sentiment and Sentiment&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thisandagain/sentiment&quot;&gt;Sentiment&lt;/a&gt; is JavaScript (Node.js) library for sentiment analysis. The library relies on AFINN (a collection of English words with an associated emotional value) and a similar database for Emoji. These database associate to each word/Emoji a positive or negative value, to indicate a positive or negative sentiment. For example, the word &lt;code&gt;joy&lt;/code&gt; has a score of &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;, while &lt;code&gt;sad&lt;/code&gt; has &lt;code&gt;-2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code for the library itself is quite trivial, but it works, and it is easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-line crayon-striped-line&quot; id=&quot;crayon-5a0d43fab7cd8076573604-6&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-t&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;r2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;crayon-o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;crayon-e&quot;&gt;sentiment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-sy&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-s&quot;&gt;'Cats are totally amazing!'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-sy&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-sy&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-line&quot; id=&quot;crayon-5a0d43fab7cd8076573604-7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-sy&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-e&quot;&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-sy&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;r2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-sy&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-sy&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-h&quot;&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-c&quot;&gt;// Score: 4, Comparative: 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sentiment analysis using machine learning techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the extent of the documentation for the Python library &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vivekn/sentiment&quot;&gt;sentiment&lt;/a&gt;. Although there is also a &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.6143&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://sentiment.vivekn.com/&quot;&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt;. The paper mentions that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have explored different methods of improving the accuracy of a Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis. We observed that a combination of methods like negation handling, word n-grams and feature selection by mutual information results in a significant improvement in accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which means that it can be a good starting point to understand how to build your own sentiment analysis library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;SpaCy&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial-Strength Natural Language Processing in Python&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The library &lt;a href=&quot;https://spacy.io/&quot;&gt;spaCy&lt;/a&gt; claims to be a much more efficient, ready for the real world and easy to use library than NLTK. In practical terms it has two advantages over NLTK:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;better performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it does not give you the chance of choosing among the many algorithms the one you think is best, instead it chooses the best one for each task. While less choices might seem bad, it can actually be a good thing. That is if you have no idea what the algorithms do and you have to learn them before making a decision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practical terms it is a library that supports most of the basic tasks we mentioned (i.e., things like named entity recognition and POS-tagging, but not translation or parsing) with a great code-first documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chartbeat-labs/textacy&quot;&gt;Textacy&lt;/a&gt; is a library built on top of spaCY for higher-level NLP tasks. Basically, it simplifies some things including features for cleaning data or managing it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Stanford Natural Language Processing Group Software&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stanford NLP Group makes some of our Natural Language Processing software available to everyone! We provide statistical NLP, deep learning NLP, and rule-based NLP tools for major computational linguistics problems, which can be incorporated into applications with human language technology needs. These packages are widely used in industry, academia, and government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stanford NLP group creates and support many great tools that cover all the purposes we have just mentioned. The only thing missing is sentiment analysis. The most notable software are &lt;a href=&quot;https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/&quot;&gt;CoreNLP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.html&quot;&gt;Parser&lt;/a&gt;. The parser can be seen in action in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/parser/index.jsp&quot;&gt;web demo&lt;/a&gt;. CoreNLP is a combination of several tools, including the parser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tools are all in Java. The parser supports a few languages: English, Chinese, Arabic, Spanish, etc. The only downside is that the tools are licensed under the GPL. Commercial licensing is available for proprietary software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Excluded Software&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think that the libraries we choose are the best ones for parsing, or processing, natural languages. However we excluded some other interesting software, which are usually mentioned, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CogComp/cogcomp-nlp&quot;&gt;CogCompNLP&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://gate.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;GATE&lt;/a&gt; for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;there might have little to no documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it might have a purely educational or any non-standard license&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it might not be designed for developers, but for end-users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article we have seen many ways to deal with a document in a natural language to get the information you need from it. Most of them tried to find smart ways to bypass the complex task of parsing natural language. Despite being hard to parse natural languages it is still possible to do so, if you use the libraries available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, when dealing with natural languages hacking a solution is the suggested way of doing things, since nobody can figure out how to do it properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where it was possible we explained the algorithms that you can use. For the most advanced tasks this would have been impractical, so we just pointed at ready-to-use libraries. In any case, if you think we missed something, be it a subject or an important library, please contact us.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Debian and GNOME announce plans to migrate communities to GitLab</title>
<link>https://about.gitlab.com/press/releases/2017-11-01-gitlab-transitions-contributor-license.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://about.gitlab.com/press/releases/2017-11-01-gitlab-transitions-contributor-license.html</guid>
<description>&lt;ol class=&quot;breadcrumb&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are here:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/press/&quot;&gt;Press and Logos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/press/releases/&quot;&gt;Press releases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitLab Transitions Contributor Licensing to Developer Certificate of Origin to Better Support Open Source Projects; Empower Contributors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;open-source-project-customers-debian-and-gnome-announce-plans-to-migrate-communities-to-gitlab-applaud-the-direction&quot;&gt;Open source project customers Debian and GNOME announce plans to migrate communities to GitLab; applaud the direction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAN FRANCISCO - November 1, 2017&lt;/strong&gt; - GitLab, a software product used by &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/is-it-any-good/&quot;&gt;2/3 of all enterprises&lt;/a&gt;, today announced it was abandoning the industry-standard Contributor License Agreement (CLA) in favor of a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) and license. The DCO gives developers greater flexibility and portability for their contributions. The move has already attracted the attention of large open source projects who recognize the benefits. Debian and GNOME both plan to migrate their communities and open source projects to GitLab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitLab’s move away from a CLA is meant to modernize its code hosting and collaborative development infrastructure for all open source projects. Additionally, requiring a CLA became problematic for developers who didn’t want to enter into legal terms; they weren’t reviewing the CLA contract and they effectively gave up their rights to own and contribute to open source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Many large open source projects want to be masters of their own destiny, but overly restrictive licensing can be a barrier to attracting talented contributors and driving innovation in the project,” said Sid Sijbrandij, CEO at GitLab. “With a DCO and license, developers no longer have to surrender their work and enter into legal terms. They will now have the freedom to contribute to open-source code and the flexibility to leverage their contributions as they need.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison, other open source platforms, like GitHub, Phabricator, Fedora, Jenkins, and Elastic, all currently require a CLA. For established companies, a shift of this magnitude is not easy. But after evaluating the needs of larger open source projects such as Debian and GNOME, GitLab came to the conclusion that a DCO would better suit their efforts to modernize code hosting and collaborative-development infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re thrilled to see GitLab simplifying and encouraging community contributions by switching from a CLA to the DCO,” said Chris Lamb, Debian Project Leader. “We recognize that making a change of this nature is not easy and we applaud the time, patience and thoughtful consideration GitLab has shown here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We applaud GitLab for dropping their CLA in favor of a more OSS-friendly approach,&quot; said Carlos Soriano, Board Director at GNOME. &quot;Open source communities are born from a sea of contributions that come together and transform into projects. This gesture affirmed GitLab's willingness to protect the individual, their creative process, and most importantly, keeps intellectual property in the hands of the creator.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to moving toward DCO, GitLab will take internal actions to review code that is submitted, to help minimize the likelihood of anything problematic entering the base. GitLab has already begun making the switch with no added steps necessary from their user base. For more information on what this means for the broader GitLab community, please visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/2017/11/01/gitlab-switches-to-dco-license/&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

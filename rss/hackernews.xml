<title>Migrating away from Google Maps and cutting costs</title>
<link>https://www.eventsofa.de/campus/migrating-away-from-google-maps-and-cutting-costs-by-99/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.eventsofa.de/campus/migrating-away-from-google-maps-and-cutting-costs-by-99/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks for the discussion on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18390425#18390675&quot;&gt;HN&lt;/a&gt; and all the feedback. As pointed out by 255kb, there is a different pricing for place mode to put markers on addresses and places. Our customers often change the marker position though, as it doesn’t reflect their understanding of their venue. If you only place a marker on an address, the Google price hike doesn’t affect you probably.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;eventsofa is a location platform where you can find locations for your events, for example for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventsofa.de/weihnachtsfeier-ideen-berlin&quot;&gt;Christmas parties&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve been using Google Maps on profile pages for some years now and have been happy with the experience. Usage was free for us, reliability was high and there was a steady stream of new features and map enhancements. Beside Maps we were also using geo coding from Google, which was a much rougher experience from Google with mixed language and bad data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came the shock, Google wanted money for Google Maps usage. From a business point of view, we surely can understand Google wanting money for its services. We did budget away money as we were expecting this to come. But what shocked us was the increase in prices by more than 1000%. They wanted to sweeten the price hike with a monthly credit, but this was a raindrop in the ocean. The projected costs from Google were several thousands of euros per month, with an upward trend indicated by Google and also our seasonal business. .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We waited two months to see real prices on our invoice as we hoped to stay with Google. First thought for staying was cutting costs and migrating to static Google maps. But this looked more complicated than migrating our Javascript to a new Mapbox API. So during this time we looked around for some alternatives. There are many offerings from Here Maps, Azure Maps, Apple Maps, TomTom and many more. After looking at some data we decided to base our usage on an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openstreetmap.org/&quot;&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt; based service. OpenStreetMap is a great service and at least in Europe the quality of data is very high. When hiking or walking I usually use something based on OSM with its higher quality of small pathways and parks compared to Google Maps. We believe OSM is the future of mapping and wanted to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/www.eventsofa.de/campus/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MapExample.png?ssl=1&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-13577&quot; src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/www.eventsofa.de/campus/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MapExample.png?resize=696%2C423&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;423&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We soon narrowed down our search to &lt;a href=&quot;https://stadiamaps.com&quot;&gt;Stadiamaps&lt;/a&gt;. They have excellent pricing, good looking tiles, support the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/&quot;&gt;Mapbox API&lt;/a&gt; and as we learned have excellent support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migration was very easy and took much shorter than we’ve expected. We decided to use the Mapbox API with &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.stadiamaps.com/themes/&quot;&gt;tiles from Stadiamaps&lt;/a&gt;. In under 30 minutes we migrated our code to Stadiamaps without prior knowledge of their API, including deployment. We saw an example to change the map marker and used it to create a pink marker, which we haven’t done with Google Maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migration led to a reduction of costs of something around 95-99% depending on seasonal traffic. Although we have to pay now for map services, the cost isn’t very high and very sustainable for us. We wish Google would have taken money from the beginning with a reasonable price we could budget instead of being free and then charging lots of money. StadiaMaps also energized us to put maps in several places we haven’t used maps before!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things have not gone as well with geo coding. Google geo coding data is only allowed to be used with Google Maps, so when you change maps you need to migrate geo coding too and recode old data. We tested several geo coding services and are comparing results to Google geocoding to see how they perform. After some changes we now use Open Cage Data geocoding. Open Cage supports both JSON and XML formats and support forward and reverse geo coding. &lt;a href=&quot;https://opencagedata.com/tutorials/migrate-from-googlemaps&quot;&gt;One benefit is we now own the coding data&lt;/a&gt; and can use it in the future even if we change the maps service or geo coding provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Cage has better results than Google and supply more useful data with each response. You can get telephone code, currency, emoji flag of the country, coordinates in different formats, sun rise and sun set, time zone and many more. Results of city names and suburbs for different languages is also much better than with Google. We had some minor data issues and Open Cage Data support was excellent with very fast fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were using placeId in Google geocoding to show users a list of coding results, let the user select one and then use the selection to geocode a location. As most geo coding service we’ve looked at didn’t support unique IDs for geo coding results, we had to rewrite backend and frontend code. Which isn’t as nice, but works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support from StadiaMaps during our decision and following the migration was excellent. We’ve exchanged some emails with Stadiamaps CEO who was very kind and helpful, overall the support experience was a pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Google for giving us free Maps for some years, we’re now very happy with Stadiamaps and should have migrated before!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>2018 Mac Mini Review</title>
<link>https://marco.org/2018/11/06/mac-mini-2018-review</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://marco.org/2018/11/06/mac-mini-2018-review</guid>
<description>&lt;header readability=&quot;0.59302325581395&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2018-11-06T06:01:39-05:00&quot; pubdate=&quot;pubdate&quot;&gt;November 6, 2018&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;permalink&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://marco.org/2018/11/06/mac-mini-2018-review&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;noprint&quot;&gt;∞&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;printonly&quot;&gt;https://marco.org/2018/11/06/mac-mini-2018-review&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ixJLLbP8Is&quot;&gt;Watch the video review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hardly ever think about my Mac Mini, but it serves a vital role for my family as our &lt;a href=&quot;https://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/&quot;&gt;home-theater mixer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plex.tv/&quot;&gt;Plex&lt;/a&gt; server, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fujitsu.com/us/products/computing/peripheral/scanners/scansnap/&quot;&gt;ScanSnap&lt;/a&gt; server, Apple Photos backup, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/atp.html&quot;&gt;Backblaze&lt;/a&gt; host for our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.synology.com/en-us&quot;&gt;NAS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:pQF3OuDFd1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marco.org/2018/11/06/mac-mini-2018-review#fn:pQF3OuDFd1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Almost every port on the back is in use, and it runs 24/7, reliably, in total silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until last week, I thought it would be the last Mac Mini that Apple ever made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when rumors started swirling about an imminent Mac Mini update, I assumed the worst: if it came at all, it would be a tiny box with a slow, ultra-low-power processor and almost zero ports, optimizing for small size instead of versatility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think this was an unreasonable fear after the 2014 Mac Mini update, which made many key aspects much worse without making anything much better. It seemed clear then, and for the following &lt;strong&gt;four years&lt;/strong&gt; that it went without an update, that Apple held the Mac Mini and its customers in very low regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2018 Mac Mini is real, and it’s spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes almost nothing worse and almost everything better, finally bringing the Mac Mini into the modern age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://marco.org/media/2018/11/macmini-ports.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;Ports! Glorious ports!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number one — and this is a big one these days, especially for this product — is that it’s not any &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; useful or versatile than the outgoing Mac Mini, including the generous assortment of ports. If the previous one served a role for you, the new one can probably do it just as well, and probably better and faster, with minimal donglage.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:pQF3OuDFd2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marco.org/2018/11/06/mac-mini-2018-review#fn:pQF3OuDFd2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the same size as the old one, which is the right tradeoff. I know zero Mac Mini owners who really need it to get smaller, and many who don’t want it to get fewer ports or worse performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of the Mac Mini is to be as versatile as possible, addressing lots of diverse and edge-case needs that the other Macs can’t with their vastly different form factors and more opinionated designs. The Mac Mini needs to be a utility product, not a design statement. (Although, even as someone tired of space-gray everything, I have to admit that the Mini looks fantastic in its new color.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base price has increased to $800, and that’s not great. It’s partly justifiable because it’s much higher-end than before — the processors are &lt;strong&gt;much&lt;/strong&gt; better, the architecture is higher-end and includes big advances like the T2, and all-SSD is standard — but it’s still an expensive product in absolute terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple lent me a high-end configuration for review — 6-core i7, 32 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD — which would cost $2499 (much of which is the SSD). This would’ve sounded crazy to spend on a Mac Mini a few years ago, but when it’s specced up like this, it’s targeting a much higher-end market than the previous model could. Compared to similarly specced iMacs and MacBook Pros, the pricing is generally reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this can truly be a pro desktop, with just one exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Benchmarks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big story to me is how incredibly &lt;strong&gt;fast&lt;/strong&gt; this thing is. Granted, I’m testing the fastest CPU offered, but &lt;strong&gt;damn&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;reviewgraph&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marco.org/media/2018/11/macmini-geekbench.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://marco.org/media/2018/11/macmini-geekbench.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geekbench.com/&quot;&gt;Geekbench&lt;/a&gt; results are very strong. The i7 Mac Mini scored better on single-core performance than &lt;a href=&quot;https://browser.geekbench.com/mac-benchmarks&quot;&gt;every other Mac today (!)&lt;/a&gt; at 5912, and its multi-core score of nearly 24,740 beats every Mac to date except the iMac Pro and the old 12-core 2013 Mac Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Performance-competitive with pro Macs” was not high on my prediction list for a Mac Mini update, but here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;reviewgraph&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marco.org/media/2018/11/macmini-xcode.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://marco.org/media/2018/11/macmini-xcode.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The T2 is great for lots of &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/apple-t2-security-chip-microphone-eavesdropping/&quot;&gt;security&lt;/a&gt; reasons — I wouldn’t buy a new Mac these days without it — but what you’re seeing here is its strength as a ridiculously fast SSD controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Mac Mini builds my app, &lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/&quot;&gt;Overcast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;much&lt;/strong&gt; faster than my maxed-out 13-inch MacBook Pro, and about as quickly as my 10-core iMac Pro! Obviously, to achieve this result with only 6 cores, it’s not maxing out the CPU 100% of the time — it hits it in bursts while juggling a lot between the SSD and memory — but the result is that it’s incredibly fast as a development machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;reviewgraph&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marco.org/media/2018/11/macmini-ffmpeg.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://marco.org/media/2018/11/macmini-ffmpeg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people use Mac Minis as media or Plex servers, so I ran an H.265 transcoding test with &lt;code&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/code&gt;. This maxes out all CPU cores, so the results predictably scale with the core count: the 6-core Mac Mini was much faster than the 4-core MacBook Pro, but the 10-core iMac Pro beat them both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;reviewgraph&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marco.org/media/2018/11/macmini-opencl.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://marco.org/media/2018/11/macmini-opencl.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only spec that lets it down is the Intel GPU. It’s fast enough for common tasks, but if your workload benefits from a strong GPU, you’re better off going for an iMac or a 15-inch MacBook Pro, or considering an eGPU setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Mac lines rely on Intel’s integrated GPUs to fit their physical and thermal needs, and Intel has been incredibly inconsistent over the last few years in delivering updated CPU-GPU combinations that would be suitable for many Macs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often blame Intel’s CPU roadmap (or Apple’s seeming indifference) for the lack of updates to certain Mac lines, but Intel’s GPU offerings are often the bigger issue. This is Intel’s fault, but it’s Apple’s problem — and Apple passes that problem right along to its customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s it — aside from price, that’s the only downside. The GPU sucks. Everything else is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t need a strong GPU — and honestly, most Mac Mini use-cases don’t — this is a solid pick for a general-purpose Mac, even at the base-level configuration. Spec it up, and it’s more like a mini-Mac Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few assorted notes, with apologies for stealing &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/2018/11/the_2018_ipad_pros&quot;&gt;Gruber’s&lt;/a&gt; format:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;8.3139730639731&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;7.5949367088608&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s silent at idle. The i7’s fan noise does become clearly audible when it’s under heavy load: it’s in the ballpark of a modern MacBook Pro, but quieter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://marco.org/2018/07/31/mac-low-power-mode&quot;&gt;disabled Turbo Boost&lt;/a&gt; to simulate the base i3 model’s thermals, and couldn’t get the fan to spin up audibly, no matter what I did. Those who prioritize silence under heavy loads should probably stick with the i3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the first non-iMac desktop Mac that lets you plug in a 5K display, at full quality, without dual cables or other unreliable hacks. We finally have 5K Retina Mac options beyond the iMac! Unfortunately, we still don’t have any great standalone 5K displays. (The LG UltraFine isn’t.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;8.8917835671343&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can upgrade the RAM again! I &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; would’ve guessed this was coming, and I believe it’s the first time in a &lt;strong&gt;long&lt;/strong&gt; time that an Apple product’s direct successor became &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt; upgradeable and serviceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still recommend getting it with the right amount of RAM from Apple if possible, since third-party RAM has historically been a mess of unreliability and finger-pointing, but if you need that, it’s back. (The security screws inside — TR6? — still need some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/&quot;&gt;iFixit&lt;/a&gt; tools to get past.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;I Can’t Believe The Mac Mini Is This Awesome, I Can’t Even Say “Again” Because It Never Was&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new Mac Mini could’ve been so much worse. At many times in its past, it has seemed unloved, neglected, and downright punitive — a similar pattern to Apple’s other headless desktop, the Mac Pro. It seemed for a while that Apple lacked any interest in making Macs anymore, especially desktops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, with the introduction of the absolutely stellar iMac Pro, Apple showed us a glimpse of a potential new direction. It was downright perfect — a love letter to the Mac and its pro desktop users, and a clear turnaround in the way the company views the Mac for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn’t know until now whether the iMac Pro’s greatness was a fluke. But now we have another data point: the last two desktops out of Apple have been incredible. After this, I have faith that they’re going to do the new Mac Pro justice when it finally ships next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Mac Mini is a great update, out of nowhere, to a product we thought would never be updated again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, with Apple’s track record on the Mac Mini, it may never be updated after this. This is either the first in a series of regular updates with which Apple proves that they care about the Mac Mini again, or it’s the last Mac Mini that will ever exist and we’ll all be hoarding them in a few years. We can’t know yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But today, this is a great update, a wonderful all-arounder for lots of potential needs, and just a fantastic little computer.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Mystery Math Whiz and Novelist Advance Permutation Problem</title>
<link>https://www.quantamagazine.org/sci-fi-writer-greg-egan-and-anonymous-math-whiz-advance-permutation-problem-20181105/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.quantamagazine.org/sci-fi-writer-greg-egan-and-anonymous-math-whiz-advance-permutation-problem-20181105/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;On September 16, 2011, an anime fan posted a math question to the online bulletin board 4chan about the cult classic television series &lt;em&gt;The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya&lt;/em&gt;. Season one of the show, which involves time travel, had originally aired in nonchronological order, and a re-broadcast and a DVD version had each further rearranged the episodes. Fans were arguing online about the best order to watch the episodes, and the 4chan poster wondered: If viewers wanted to see the series in every possible order, what is the shortest list of episodes they’d have to watch?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In less than an hour, an anonymous person offered an answer — not a complete solution, but a lower bound on the number of episodes required. The argument, which covered series with any number of episodes, showed that for the 14-episode first season of &lt;em&gt;Haruhi&lt;/em&gt;, viewers would have to watch at least 93,884,313,611 episodes to see all possible orderings. “Please look over [the proof] for any loopholes I might have missed,” the anonymous poster wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proof slipped under the radar of the mathematics community for seven years — apparently only one professional mathematician spotted it at the time, and he didn’t check it carefully. But in a plot twist last month, the Australian science fiction novelist &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/32699.Greg_Egan&quot;&gt;Greg Egan&lt;/a&gt; proved a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gregegan.net/SCIENCE/Superpermutations/Superpermutations.html&quot;&gt;upper bound&lt;/a&gt; on the number of episodes required. Egan’s discovery renewed interest in the problem and drew attention to the lower bound posted anonymously in 2011. Both proofs are now being hailed as significant advances on a puzzle mathematicians have been studying for at least 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathematicians quickly verified Egan’s upper bound, which, like the lower bound, applies to series of any length. Then Robin Houston, a mathematician at the data visualization firm Kiln, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://jaypantone.com/&quot;&gt;Jay Pantone&lt;/a&gt; of Marquette University in Milwaukee independently verified the work of the anonymous 4chan poster. “It took a lot of work to try to figure out whether or not it was correct,” Pantone said, since the key ideas hadn’t been expressed particularly clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Houston and Pantone, joined by &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.clas.ufl.edu/vatter/&quot;&gt;Vince Vatter&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Florida in Gainesville, have written up the formal argument. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;amp;pid=forums&amp;amp;srcid=MTUwMTUxMjExNDk4NTk5NjY5OTkBMDMxNDgwMTA5ODA5OTYyNzcyNDQBVF9leXJHY19Dd0FKATAuMQEBdjI&amp;amp;authuser=0&quot;&gt;their paper&lt;/a&gt;, they list the first author as “Anonymous 4chan Poster.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a weird situation that this very elegant proof of something that wasn’t previously known was posted in such an unlikely place,” Houston said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Permutation Cities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a television series has just three episodes, there are six possible orders in which to view them: 123, 132, 213, 231, 312 and 321. You could string these six sequences together to give a list of 18 episodes that includes every ordering, but there’s a much more efficient way to do it: 123121321. A sequence like this one that contains every possible rearrangement (or permutation) of a collection of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; symbols is called a “superpermutation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1993, &lt;a href=&quot;http://eldar.mathstat.uoguelph.ca/dashlock/&quot;&gt;Daniel Ashlock&lt;/a&gt; and Jenett Tillotson &lt;a href=&quot;https://zbmath.org/?format=complete&amp;amp;q=an:0801.05004&quot;&gt;observed&lt;/a&gt; that if you look at the shortest superpermutations for different values of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;, a pattern quickly seems to emerge involving factorials — those numbers, written in the form &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;!, that involve multiplying together all the numbers up to &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; (for example, 4! = 4 × 3  × 2 × 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your series has just one episode, the shortest superpermutation has length 1! (also known as plain old 1). For a two-episode series, the shortest superpermutation (121) has length 2! + 1!. For three episodes (the example we looked at above), the length works out to 3! + 2! + 1!, and for four episodes (123412314231243121342132413214321), it is 4! + 3! + 2! + 1!. The factorial rule for superpermutations became conventional wisdom (even though no one could prove it was true for every value of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;), and mathematicians later confirmed it for &lt;em&gt;n &lt;/em&gt;= 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in 2014, Houston startled mathematicians by &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5108&quot;&gt;showing that for &lt;em&gt;n &lt;/em&gt;= 6&lt;/a&gt;, the pattern breaks down. The factorial rule predicts that to watch six episodes in every possible order should require 873 episodes, but Houston found a way to do it in 872. And since there is a simple way to convert a short superpermutation on &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; symbols into a short superpermutation on &lt;em&gt;n &lt;/em&gt;+ 1 symbols, Houston’s example meant that the factorial rule fails for every value of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; above 6 too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Houston’s construction works by translating the superpermutation problem into the famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/traveling-salesman-problem/&quot;&gt;traveling salesman problem&lt;/a&gt;, which looks for the shortest route through a collection of cities. More specifically, superpermutations are connected to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/one-way-salesman-finds-fast-path-home-20171005/&quot;&gt;“asymmetric” traveling salesman problem&lt;/a&gt;, in which each path between two cities has a cost (which is not necessarily the same in both directions), and the goal is to find the least expensive route through all the cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The translation is simple: Think of each permutation as a “city” and imagine a path from each permutation to each other permutation. In the superpermutation problem, we want the shortest possible sequence of digits that lists all the permutations, so the goal is to travel through the permutations in a way that adds as few digits to the starting permutation as possible. So we declare the cost of each path to be simply the number of digits we have to attach to the end of the first permutation to get the second one. In the &lt;em&gt;n &lt;/em&gt;= 3 example, for instance, the path from 231 to 312 costs $1, since we just have to add a 2 to the end of 231 to get 312, while the path from 231 to 132 costs $2, since we have to add a 32. With this setup, the least-expensive path through the cities corresponds directly to the shortest superpermutation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This translation meant that Houston could turn the power of traveling salesman algorithms on the superpermutation problem. The traveling salesman problem is famous as an NP-hard problem, meaning that there’s no efficient algorithm that can solve all cases of it. But there are algorithms that can solve some cases efficiently, and other algorithms that produce good approximate solutions. Houston used one of the latter to produce his 872-digit superpermutation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since he produced only an approximate solution, it might not be the very best superpermutation. Mathematicians are now conducting a giant computer search for the shortest superpermutation on six symbols, Pantone said. “We know our search will finish in finite time, but don’t know if that’s one week or a million years,” he said. “There’s no progress bar.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Wrong Order&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time of Houston’s work, the anonymous 4chan post had been sitting in its corner of the internet for nearly three years. One mathematician, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.njohnston.ca/&quot;&gt;Nathaniel Johnston&lt;/a&gt; of Mount Allison University, had noticed a copy of the post on a different website a few days after it was posted — not because he was an anime fan, but because he had typed an assortment of superpermutation-related search terms into Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnston read the argument and thought it seemed plausible, but he didn’t invest much effort in checking it carefully. At the time, mathematicians believed that the factorial formula for superpermutations was probably correct, and when you think you know the exact answer to a question, a lower bound isn’t very interesting. In other words, the superpermutation research episodes were playing out of order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnston later mentioned the lower bound on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.njohnston.ca/2013/04/the-minimal-superpermutation-problem/&quot;&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://oeis.org/A180632&quot;&gt;websites&lt;/a&gt;, but “I don’t think anyone really gave it any particular heed,” Houston said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then on September 26 of this year, the mathematician &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt; of the University of California, Riverside, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/johncarlosbaez/status/1045084142151450624&quot;&gt;posted on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; about Houston’s 2014 finding, as part of a series of tweets about apparent mathematical patterns that fail. His tweet caught the eye of Egan, who was a mathematics major decades ago, before he launched an award-winning career as a science fiction novelist (his breakthrough 1994 novel, in a happy coincidence, was called &lt;em&gt;Permutation City&lt;/em&gt;). “I’ve never stopped being interested in [mathematics],” Egan wrote by email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egan wondered if it was possible to construct superpermutations even shorter than Houston’s. He scoured the literature for papers on how to construct short paths through permutation networks, and after a few weeks found exactly what he needed. Within a day or two, he had come up with a new upper bound on the length of the shortest superpermutation for &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; symbols: &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;! + (&lt;em&gt;n – &lt;/em&gt;1)! + (&lt;em&gt;n – &lt;/em&gt;2)! + (&lt;em&gt;n –&lt;/em&gt; 3)! + &lt;em&gt;n – &lt;/em&gt;3. It’s similar to the old factorial formula, but with many terms removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It absolutely smashed the [previous] upper bound,” Houston said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anonymous 4chan poster’s lower bound, meanwhile, was tantalizingly close to the new upper bound: It works out to &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;! + (&lt;em&gt;n – &lt;/em&gt;1)! + (&lt;em&gt;n – &lt;/em&gt;2)! + &lt;em&gt;n – &lt;/em&gt;3. When Egan’s result became public, Johnston reminded other mathematicians about the anonymous poster’s proof, and Houston and Pantone soon showed it was correct. As with Houston’s work, the new lower and upper bounds both come at superpermutations via the traveling salesman problem: The lower bound shows that a route through all the cities must travel along some minimum number of paths that cost more than $1, while the upper bound constructs a specific route for each &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; that uses only $1 and $2 connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers are now trying to bring the upper and lower bounds together to find a single formula that solves the superpermutation problem. “Probably people are eventually going to completely nail down this puzzle,” Baez predicted. “It’s looking good now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;em&gt;Haruhi&lt;/em&gt; fans, Egan’s construction gives explicit instructions for how to watch all possible orderings of season one in just 93,924,230,411 episodes. Viewers could start binge-watching immediately, or they could wait and see whether mathematicians can whittle this number down. The anonymous poster’s lower bound proves that this whittling down couldn’t possibly save more than about 40 million episodes — but that’s enough to get a nice start on season two.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Amazon Plans to Split HQ2 in Two Locations: NY and VA</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/technology/amazon-second-headquarters-split.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-18sbwfn StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;SEATTLE — After conducting a yearlong search for a second home, Amazon has switched gears and is now finalizing plans to have a total of 50,000 employees in two locations, according to people familiar with the decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The company is nearing a deal to move to the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, according to two of the people briefed on the discussions. Amazon is also close to a deal to move to the Crystal City area of Arlington, Va., a Washington suburb, one of the people said. Amazon already has more employees in those two areas than anywhere else outside of Seattle, its home base, and the Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Amazon executives met two weeks ago with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in the governor’s Manhattan office, said one of the people briefed on the process, adding that the state had offered potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies. Executives met separately with Mayor Bill de Blasio, a person briefed on that discussion said. Long Island City is a short subway ride across the East River from Midtown Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“I am doing everything I can,” Governor Cuomo told reporters when asked Monday about the state’s efforts to lure the company. “We have a great incentive package,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-18sbwfn StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“I’ll change my name to Amazon Cuomo if that’s what it takes,” Governor Cuomo said. “Because it would be a great economic boost.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The need to hire tens of thousands of high-tech workers has been the driving force behind the search, leading many to expect it to land in a major East Coast metropolitan area. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/business/amazon-hq2-virginia-finalists.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Many experts have pointed to Crystal City&lt;/a&gt; as a front-runner, because of its strong public transit, educated work force and proximity to Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;[&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/business/amazon-hq2-virginia-finalists.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;Crystal City’s upsides&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;: good transit, diverse residents, a friendly business climate and a single developer with a big chunk of land.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;JBG Smith, a developer who owns much of the land in Crystal City, declined to comment, as did Arlington County officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Amazon declined to comment on whether it had made any final decisions. The Wall Street Journal &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-plans-to-split-hq2-evenly-between-two-cities-1541446552?mod=hp_lead_pos1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;earlier reported&lt;/a&gt; Amazon’s decision to pick two new locations instead of one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-18sbwfn StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;About 1,800 people in advertising, fashion and publishing already work for Amazon in New York, and roughly 2,500 corporate and technical employees work in Northern Virginia and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Amazon narrowed the list to 20 cities in January, and in recent weeks, smaller locations appeared to fall out of the running. For example, although Denver made the initial cut, Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado said &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cpr.org/news/story/hickenlooper-there-were-issues-with-amazon-coming-to-denver-as-signs-point-to-other&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;, “Wouldn’t they rather have their second big hub on the East Coast?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Amazon announced plans for a second headquarters in September 2017, saying that the company was growing faster than it could hire in its hometown Seattle. The company said it would invest more than $5 billion over almost two decades in a second headquarters, hiring as many as 50,000 full-time employees that would earn more than $100,000 a year on average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;HQ2 would be “full equal to our current campus in Seattle,” the company said. If Amazon goes ahead with two new sites, it is unclear whether the company would refer to both of the locations as headquarters or if they would amount to large satellite offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Picking multiple sites would allow it to tap into two pools of talented labor and perhaps avoid being blamed for all of the housing and traffic woes of dominating a single area. It could also give the company greater leverage in negotiating tax incentives, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Even if the most obvious reasons appear to be about attracting more tech workers, the P.R. and government incentives benefits could help, too,” said Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed, the online jobs site. With big presences in two cities, the local governments “might feel pressure to increase the incentives they are offering Amazon, and the surprise is yet another news cycle for the Amazon headquarters process,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The HQ2 search sent states and cities into a frenzied bidding war. Some hired McKinsey &amp;amp; Company and other outside consultants to help them with their bids, investing heavily in courting Amazon and its promise of 50,000 jobs. Even half of that would amount to one of the largest corporate location deals, according to Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, which tracks corporate subsidies. “These are very big numbers,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-18sbwfn StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;As Amazon’s search dragged on, residents in many of 20 finalist cities worried about the impact such a massive project could have on housing and traffic, as well as what potential tax incentives could cost the community. The decision to split into two sites could alleviate some of that resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Seattle has been one of the fastest growing cities in the country, in part because of Amazon’s growth. The company has about 45,000 employees in the city, and the company said it needed to hire more employees than the city could attract or absorb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Not everybody wants to live in the Northwest,” Jeff Wilke, the head of Amazon’s retail division, said at a conference last year. “It’s been terrific for me and my family, but I think we may find another location allows us to recruit a different collection of employees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Amazon gave cities six weeks to pitch themselves in a public courtship. Almost 240 municipalities responded, trying to lure the tech giant with marketing gimmicks, promises of new transit lines and, as proposals trickled out, billions in tax incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The details of most bids are not public, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/05/technology/amazon-headquarters-hq2.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;to the frustration of even some&lt;/a&gt; lawmakers. A few elected officials from the short list of 20 cities signed what amounted to a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/GregorioCasar/photos/a.623578621062723.1073741828.621003034653615/1725573660863208/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mutual nonaggression pact&lt;/a&gt;, trying to avoid a bidding war that would give up too much from taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But mostly, cities continued their hard sell, showing &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/29/technology/amazon-hq2-seattle.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; executives around their proposed sites and trying to assure the company that the region had sufficient housing and transportation. Since wrapping up visits with cities in the spring, Amazon has been almost silent on the search. That led journalists, residents and politicians to look for clues in new job postings and the flight path of the corporate jet used by Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;To meet its own deadlines, Amazon will need to move fast. It had said it wanted 500,000 square feet of office space — enough for thousands of employees — available for use next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-18sbwfn StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Jay Brodsky, who lives in Arlington, Va., said about a week ago that his wife took part in a 45-minute phone survey about her opinion if Amazon moved to the area. “It was everything from, ‘What do you think about the local government,’ to ‘Are you concerned about traffic?’” he said. She received an Amazon gift card for participating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“People are sort of on pins and needles,” Mr. Brodsky said. “It’s almost like people want it to happen, and are afraid of what would happen if it does.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year, you! Now that the champagne has gone flat and the Christmas tree is off to be mulched, it’s time to turn your thoughts to the months ahead. 2017 was a pustule of a year, politically and personally; the general anxiety around the degradation of American democracy made it hard to get much done. That’s O.K., though, because you’ve made new resolutions for 2018, and the first one is not to make resolutions. Instead, you’re going to “set goals,” in the terminology of the productivity guru Tim Ferriss—preferably ones that are measurable and have timelines, so you can keep track of your success. Apps like Lifetick or Joe’s Goals will help by keeping you organized and allowing you to share your progress on social media; a little gloating does wonders for self-motivation (unless, of course, one of your goals is to spend less time on social media). Once your goals are in place, it might be smart to design a methodology that will encourage you to accomplish them. Charles Duhigg, the author of “&lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/081298160X/?tag=thneyo0f-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Power of Habit&lt;/a&gt;,” recommends a three-step self-conditioning process. You want to get to the gym more? Pick a cue (sneakers by the door); choose a reward that will motivate you to act on it (a piece of chocolate); execute. Bravo! You are now Pavlov &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; his dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But soon enough February will come, mid-winter doldrums will set in, and you’ll start to slide. Not to worry. Jane McGonigal’s “&lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0143109774/?tag=thneyo0f-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SuperBetter&lt;/a&gt;” tells you how to gamify your way back from the edge with the help of video-game-inspired techniques like finding “allies” and collecting motivational “power-ups”; and Angela Duckworth’s “Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance” reminds you that persistence makes all the difference when the going gets rough. Duckworth doesn’t think you need talent in order to become, as another of Duhigg’s books puts it, &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0812983599/?tag=thneyo0f-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“Smarter Better Faster,&lt;/a&gt;” and neither do any of these other experts. According to their systems, anyone can learn to be more efficient, more focussed, more effective in the pursuit of happiness and, that most hallowed of modern traits, productivity. And if you can’t, well, that’s on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-help advice tends to reflect the beliefs and priorities of the era that spawns it. A decade ago, the reigning champion of the genre was “&lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/1582701709/?tag=thneyo0f-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Secret&lt;/a&gt;,” published in 2006 by an Australian, Rhonda Byrne. Like Norman Vincent Peale before her, Byrne combined a literal interpretation of select verses from the Christian Bible—notably Matthew 21:22, “Whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, ye shall receive”—with the acquisitive gospel of positive thinking. If you sent a wish out into the universe with enough faith, she told her readers, it could come to pass. Want to find a husband? Clean out a closet for the man of your dreams and imagine him hanging up his ties. Want to get rid of your glasses? Picture yourself acing your next vision exam and kiss those progressive lenses goodbye. In retrospect, “The Secret,” which sold more than twenty million copies worldwide, seems a testament to the predatory optimism that characterized the years leading up to the financial crisis. People dreamed big, and, in a day of easy money, found that their dreams could come true. Then the global economy crashed, and we were shaken violently awake—at least for a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our current era of non-stop technological innovation, fuzzy wishful thinking has yielded to the hard doctrine of personal optimization. Self-help gurus need not be charlatans peddling snake oil. Many are psychologists with impressive academic pedigrees and a commitment to scientific methodologies, or tech entrepreneurs with enviable records of success in life and business. What they’re selling is metrics. It’s no longer enough to imagine our way to a better state of body or mind. We must now chart our progress, count our steps, log our sleep rhythms, tweak our diets, record our negative thoughts—then analyze the data, recalibrate, and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Cederström and André Spicer, business-school professors in a field called “organization studies,” set out to do all that and more in their recent book, “&lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/1944869395/?tag=thneyo0f-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Desperately Seeking Self-Improvement: A Year Inside the Optimization Movement&lt;/a&gt;” (OR Books), a comically committed exploration of current life-hacking wisdom in areas ranging from athletic and intellectual prowess to spirituality, creativity, wealth, and pleasure. Cederström, an enthusiastic Swede, and Spicer, a melancholy New Zealander, want to understand the lengths to which people will go to transform themselves into superior beings, and to examine the methods that they use. In their previous book, “&lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0745655610/?tag=thneyo0f-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Wellness Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;,” the authors followed health nuts who were determined to meditate and exercise their way to enlightenment. This time, in the spirit of George Plimpton’s brand of participatory journalism, they’ve become their own test cases, embarking on a yearlong program in which they target a new area of the self to improve each month. They bulk up at Cross Fit, go on the Master Cleanse liquid diet, try mindfulness and yoga, consult therapists and career coaches, sample prostate vibrators, attempt standup comedy, and attend a masculinity-boosting workshop that involves screaming and weeping naked in the woods. Even their book’s format—entries of the diary that each keeps to record and reflect on his endeavors—is relevant to their mission, considering that daily journaling is recommended in Tim Ferriss’s “Tools of Titans: The Tactics, Routines, and Habits of Billionaires, Icons, and World-Class Performers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the tasks that Cederström and Spicer assign themselves have a double-dare quality whose cost-benefit value seems questionable, like memorizing the first thousand digits of pi during Brain Month in order to improve mental acuity. But others inspire the same niggling whisper of self-doubt as Instagram posts of green juice: &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Should I be doing that, too&lt;/em&gt;? I confess to feeling a pang of jealousy when Cederström produces a complete book manuscript in a euphoric amphetamine rush induced by study drugs during Productivity Month—and a surge of Schadenfreude when it’s rejected by his baffled publisher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a consumerist society, we are not meant to buy one pair of jeans and then be satisfied,” Cederström and Spicer write, and the same, they think, is true of self-improvement. We are being sold on the need to upgrade all parts of ourselves, all at once, including parts that we did not previously know needed upgrading. (This may explain Yoni eggs, stone vaginal inserts that purport to strengthen women’s pelvic-floor muscles and take away “negative energy.” Gwyneth Paltrow’s Web site, Goop, offers them in both jade and rose quartz.) There is a great deal of money to be made by those who diagnose and treat our fears of inadequacy; Cederström and Spicer estimate that the self-improvement industry takes in ten billion dollars a year. (They report that they each spent more than ten thousand dollars, not to mention thousands of hours, on their own quests.) The good life may have sufficed for Plato and Aristotle, but it is no longer enough. “We are under pressure to show that we know how to lead the perfect life,” Cederström and Spicer write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where success can be measured with increasing accuracy, so, too, can failure. On the other side of self-improvement, Cederström and Spicer have discovered, is a sense not simply of inadequacy but of fraudulence. In December, with the end of their project approaching, Spicer reflects that he has spent the year focussing on himself to the exclusion of everything, and everyone, else in his life. His wife is due to give birth to their second child in a few days; their relationship is not at its best. And yet, he writes, “I could not think of another year I spent more of my time doing things that were &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; me at all.” He doesn’t feel like a better version of himself. He doesn’t even feel like himself. He has been like a man possessed: “If it wasn’t me, who was it then?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;115.66401384083&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desire to achieve and to demonstrate perfection is not simply stressful; it can also be fatal, according to the British journalist Will Storr. His forthcoming book, “&lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/1468315897/?tag=thneyo0f-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Selfie: How We Became So Self-Obsessed and What It’s Doing to Us&lt;/a&gt;” (Overlook), opens, alarmingly, with a chapter on suicide. Storr is disturbed by the prevalence of suicide in the United States and Britain, and blames the horror and shame of failing to meet the sky-high expectations we set for ourselves. He cites surveys that show that adolescent girls are increasingly unhappy with their bodies, and that a growing number of men are suffering from muscle dysmorphia; he interviews psychologists and professors who describe an epidemic of crippling anxiety among university students yoked to the phenomenon of “perfectionist presentation”—the tendency, especially on social media, to make life look like a string of enviable triumphs. Storr confesses that he, too, is dogged by self-loathing and suicidal thoughts. “We’re living in an age of perfectionism, and perfection is the idea that kills,” he writes. “People are suffering and dying under the torture of the fantasy self they’re failing to become.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storr’s explanation for how we got into this predicament has three strands. First, there is nature. “Because of the way our brains function, our sense of ‘me’ naturally runs in narrative mode,” he writes; studies show that we are hardwired to see life as a story in which we star. At the same time, he says, we are tribal creatures, evolved during our hunter-gatherer years to value coöperation and, at the same time, to respect hierarchy and covet status—“to get along &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; get ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next comes culture—a trajectory that wends its way from the ancient Greeks, with their idea that humans are rational creatures who must strive in order to fulfill their highest potential, to Christianity, with its doctrine of a sinful self that requires salvation, to Freud, who’s “just a self-hating, sex-afeared, secular reinvention” of the same, and, finally, to the perilous American pursuit of happiness. Storr has conflicted feelings about the American view that the self is fundamentally good, and thus worthy of comfort and satisfaction. On the one hand, it’s a nice change from Christian guilt. On the other, it has “infected” the rest of the world with aspirational narcissism. Storr has harsh words for positive psychology, and for the self-esteem movement. He reserves special scorn for the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, which pioneered the Human Potential Movement back in the nineteen-sixties and has recently gained popularity with the Silicon Valley crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there’s the economy. Survival in the hypercompetitive, globalized economy, where workers have fewer protections and are more disposable than ever, requires that we try to become faster, smarter, and more creative. (To this list of marketable qualities I’d add one with a softer edge: niceness, which the gig economy and its five-star rating system have made indispensable to everyone from cabdrivers to plumbers.) Anything less than our best won’t cut it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while, Storr says, this rational response to economic pressures became instinctive habit: “Neoliberalism beams at us from many corners of our culture and we absorb it back into ourselves like radiation.” Like reality television before it, social media frames human relationships as a constant competition for popularity and approval. Donald Trump, with his greed-is-good hucksterism and his obsessive talk of “winners” and “losers,” is in the White House. (“Selfie” was published in England last year; Storr is adding a chapter about the President for the American edition.) Meanwhile, parents continue to feed their children the loving, well-intentioned lie that there are “no limits” and they can “be anything,” which leaves the kids blaming themselves, rather than the market’s brutality, when they inevitably come up short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO&quot;&gt;“And I got this one for calling the President ‘sir,’ sarcastically.”&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All told, this is a bleak picture. If the ideal of the optimized self isn’t simply a fad, or even a preference, but an economic necessity, how can any of us choose to live otherwise? Storr insists that there is a way. “This isn’t a message of hopelessness,” he writes. “On the contrary, what it actually leads us towards is a better way of finding happiness. Once you realize that it’s all just an act of coercion, that it’s your culture trying to turn you into someone you can’t really be, you can begin to free yourself from your demands.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds suspiciously like self-help-speak, Storr acknowledges. He is quick to say that he isn’t encouraging anything quite as clichéd as self-acceptance. At the same time, he reports that he has, in fact, come to accept himself. “Since I learned that low agreeableness and high neuroticism are relatively stable facets of my personality, rather than signs of some shameful psychological impurity, I’ve stopped berating myself so frequently,” he writes. Instead, he now apologizes to those whom his disagreeableness and his neuroticism have offended. This seems like good, common sense, but Storr has another, more radical suggestion to make. Since it is our environment that is causing us to feel inferior, it is our environment that we must change: “The things we’re doing with our lives, the people we’re sharing it with, the goals we have. We should find projects to pursue which are not only meaningful to us, but over which we have efficacy.” Storr means to be helpful, but changing every aspect of the world we inhabit is a daunting prospect. No wonder people try to change themselves instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;76.557558945908&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah Knight has advice of a more specific kind to offer. Her latest book, “&lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316445126/?tag=thneyo0f-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;You Do You: How to Be Who You Are and Use What You’ve Got to Get What You Want&lt;/a&gt;” (Little, Brown), is the third she has published in two years, after “The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F*ck: How to Stop Spending Time You Don’t Have with People You Don’t Like Doing Things You Don’t Want to Do” and “Get Your Sh*t Together: How to Stop Worrying About What You Should Do So You Can Finish What You Need to Do and Start Doing What You Want to Do.” Knight’s books belong to what Storr sniffily calls the “this is me, being real, deal with it” school of self-help guides, which tend to share a skepticism toward the usual self-improvement bromides and a taste for cheerful profanity. Other recent titles include “The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck,” by Mark Manson, and “F*ck Feelings,” by Michael I. Bennett, a practicing psychiatrist, and Sarah Bennett, his daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knight, who favors the shouty, super-caffeinated tone of a spin-class instructor, calls herself a “bestselling anti-guru.” She is particularly proud of the best-selling part, and it’s easy to see why her approach appeals. The phrase &lt;em class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU&lt;/em&gt; takes up two full pages of her first chapter. She agrees with Storr that what is wrong is society, or, rather, the “random, stupid obligations set forth by society—whether to be nice or thin or to act submissive or sane.” Sanity seems not to be an entirely random or stupid social obligation, but never mind. Knight’s point is to encourage her readers to embrace themselves as they are, warts and all, and to help them do so she proposes strategies like “mental redecorating” (recasting one’s weaknesses as strengths), embracing pessimism (to be pragmatic and set realistic expectations), being selfish (advocating for one’s needs), dwelling on the thought of death (to maximize happiness while alive), and “breaking free from the Cult of Nice.” Knight is happy to demonstrate the latter. “You have to stop giving a fuck about what other people think,” she tells us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the advice in “You Do You” is geared toward helping readers confront the workplace dissatisfactions of the daily grind. Generally, the idea is to be more assertive. “If a boss doesn’t like the way I operate, she can fire me,” Knight writes. “If a client thinks my unconventional ways aren’t for him, he doesn’t have to hire me.” This is curiously cavalier. Where Storr is concerned with the precarity of modern-day work, Knight is preoccupied with the tedium endured by the office-bound class: pointless morning meetings, irritating group projects. She gives her readers permission not to care too much about always doing their best on the job, because, as she reveals, she knows what it is to be a perfectionist. As an adolescent, she suffered from eating disorders. After graduating from Harvard, she made a career as a book editor at a big publishing house. She was successful, but stressed. Knight describes experiencing panic attacks that required medical attention; to stay calm at work, she kept a kitty-litter box full of sand under her desk so that she could plunge her toes into a simulated beach. In 2016, when she was thirty-six, she left her job and her home in Brooklyn and moved with her husband to the Dominican Republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The difference between me and a lot of condescending bozos out there is that I don’t give a Fig Newton whether anyone chooses to do it the same, differently, or wearing a gold lamé unitard,” Knight writes. In other words, she is not advocating that all of us quit our day jobs and “step off the motherfucking ledge,” as she did. Still, it comes as something of a shock to realize that the person who has been advising us to push against the lean-in mores of contemporary office culture leaned so far out that she escaped altogether. Many readers will undoubtedly find this inspiring. Others may feel betrayed. What about those who can’t afford to take the risk of stepping away from their lives, as much as they may want to? While they are stuck in their cubicles, mentally redecorating and meditating on death, Knight is sipping piña coladas and writing her next best-selling “No F*cks Given” guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;106.04161224109&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those for whom the imperative to “do you” feels like an unaffordable luxury may take some solace from Svend Brinkmann’s book “&lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/1509514260/?tag=thneyo0f-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stand Firm: Resisting the Self-Improvement Craze&lt;/a&gt;” (Polity), first published in his native Denmark, in 2014, and now available in an English translation by Tam McTurk. Before “Stand Firm” came out, the author’s note tells us, Brinkmann lived “the relatively sedate life of a professor of psychology at Aalborg University.” Then the book became a best-selling sensation. Brinkmann now lives the life of a successful European public intellectual, appearing on TV and radio and travelling the world to lecture “on the big questions of modern life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big question that Brinkmann addresses in “Stand Firm” is speed. The pace of life is accelerating, he says. We succumb to fleeting trends in food, fashion, and health. Technology has eroded the boundary between work and private life; we are expected to be constantly on call, to do more, “do it better and do it for longer, with scant regard for the content or the meaning of what we are doing.” Like Storr, Brinkmann condemns self-improvement as both a symptom and a tool of a relentless economy. But where Storr sees a health crisis, Brinkmann sees a spiritual one. His rhetoric is that of a prophet counselling against false idols. “In our secular world, we no longer see eternal paradise as a carrot at the end of the stick of life, but try to cram as much as possible into our relatively short time on the planet instead,” he writes. “If you stand still while everyone else is moving forwards, you fall behind. Doing so these days is tantamount to going backwards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, as Brinkmann’s title makes clear, standing still is precisely what he proposes that we do. Enough of our mania to be the best and the most, he says. It’s time to content ourselves with being average. With pride, he tells us that, when he and his colleagues at Aalborg University were asked to propose institutional development goals, he suggested “that we should strive to become a mediocre institute.” (“I thought it was a realistic goal worth pursuing for a small university,” he explains. His colleagues did not agree.) And enough of self-acceptance, too—in fact, enough of the self! “Being yourself has no intrinsic value whatsoever,” Brinkmann tells us. Maybe the Norwegian nationalist Anders Breivik felt that he was being “true to himself” when he went on his murderous rampage; maybe Mother Teresa did not. What difference does it make? If you must engage in soul-searching or self-analysis, Brinkmann advises limiting it to once a year, preferably during summer vacation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Knight’s can-do cheerleading, this is like having a glass of ice water poured over your head. It’s harsh, but bracing. In cheeky deference to the self-help genre, Brinkmann has structured “Stand Firm” as a seven-step guide of the type that he abhors. Chapter titles include “Focus on the negative in your life,” “Put on your No hat,” and “Suppress your feelings.” The goal is to accept, with calm resolve, the fact that we are mortal, and irreparably flawed. He is big on the Stoics, with their focus on the transience of worldly things. (So, for that matter, is Tim Ferriss.) And he finds wisdom in other, more surprising sources. “I might not be an expert in Jewish culture (my main source of knowledge is Woody Allen’s films),” he writes, in a section in praise of “kvetching,” “but I get the impression that a general acceptance of griping about things both big and small is actually a cultural conduit that fosters collective happiness and satisfaction.” I can assure Brinkmann that the concepts of collective happiness and satisfaction are all but alien to the Jewish people, but if kvetching works for him he is welcome to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important thing, in any case, is the word “collective.” Brinkmann doesn’t care so much how we feel about ourselves. He cares how we act toward others. His book is concerned with morality, which tends to get short shrift in the self-improvement literature. He likes old-fashioned concepts: integrity, self-control, character, dignity, loyalty, rootedness, obligation, tradition. Above all, he exhorts us to do our duty. By this, I think he means that we are supposed to carry on with life’s unpleasant demands even when we don’t feel particularly well served by them, not run off to the Dominican Republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this gives “Stand Firm” a somewhat conservative cast. Even the phrase “stand firm” may sound pretty fogyish. Brinkmann can come off like a parent telling his tetchy teen-ager to tough it out, and sometimes, like the teen-ager, you want to talk back. Much of his advice is contradictory. How are we supposed to both suppress our feelings and emphasize the negative? And doesn’t “dwelling on the past,” the corrective that Brinkmann advises, lead to the kind of maudlin nostalgia for the good old days that got us Brexit and Trump? “I would contend that, in a culture where everything else is accelerating, some form of conservatism may actually be the truly progressive approach,” Brinkmann writes. He acknowledges that this is paradoxical. His advice, like all advice, is imperfect, and limited. He, too, is only human. That’s part of his charm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;30&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest paradox of “Stand Firm,” as Brinkmann is well aware, is that it calls for an individual solution to a collective problem. There’s good reason to fear being left behind by an accelerating society, especially a society, like ours, that is not kind to those who don’t, or can’t, keep up. Brinkmann at least has the Danish welfare state to fall back on. Still, you don’t need to agree with everything he says to recognize that there is value in reading his book. Mainly, you come away with the comforting sense that there are other people out there struggling with the same pressures and frustrations, who experience similar dissatisfactions and worry about their own inadequacies. That feeling—solidarity—is another Brinkmann value. We may be blundering forward, but we are not blundering alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Brinkmann does offer some advice that seems immediately worth taking. Go for a walk in the woods, he says, and think about the vastness of the cosmos. Go to a museum and look at art, secure in the knowledge that it will not improve you in any measurable way. Things don’t need to be of concrete use in order to have value. Put away your self-help guides, and read a novel instead. Don’t mind if I do. ♦&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Learning to Read in Your 30s Profoundly Transforms the Brain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The learning process leads to a reorganization that extends to deep brain structures.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;By Max Planck Institute for Human Cognition and Brain Sciences and Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;social&quot;&gt;   &lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;article readability=&quot;78.942939689419&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;eading is such a new ability in human evolutionary history that the existence of a “reading area” could not be specified in our genes. A kind of recycling process has to take place in the brain while learning to read: Areas evolved for the recognition of complex objects, such as faces, become engaged in translating letters into language. Some regions of our visual system thereby turn into interfaces between the visual and language systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Until now it was assumed that these changes are limited to the outer layer of the brain, the cortex, which is known to adapt quickly to new challenges,” says project leader Falk Huettig from the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics. The Max Planck researchers together with Indian scientists from the Centre of Bio-Medical Research (CBMR) Lucknow and the University of Hyderabad have now discovered what changes occur in the adult brain when completely illiterate people learn to read and write. In contrast to previous assumptions, the learning process leads to a reorganization that extends to deep brain structures in the thalamus and the brainstem. The relatively young phenomenon of human writing, therefore, changes brain regions that are very old in evolutionary terms and already core parts of mice and other mammalian brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/maxplanck_0621757c44fcadcf23f202d615e56352.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;brain_breaker&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;When becoming literate neuroplasticity conquers a network that is deeply rooted in the brain. This reorganization makes us more and more efficient in visually navigating through letter strings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;© Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive Brain Sciences&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We observed that the so-called colliculi superiores, a part of the brainstem, and the pulvinar, located in the thalamus, adapt the timing of their activity patterns to those of the visual cortex,” says Michael Skeide, scientific researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences (MPI CBS) in Leipzig and first author of the study, which has been published in the renowned magazine &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;. “These deep structures in the thalamus and brainstem help our visual cortex to filter important information from the flood of visual input even before we consciously perceive it.” Interestingly, it seems that the more the signal timings between the two brain regions are aligned, the better the reading capabilities. “We, therefore, believe that these brain systems increasingly fine-tune their communication as learners become more and more proficient in reading,” the neuroscientist explains further. “This could explain why experienced readers navigate more efficiently through a text.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large-scale study with illiterates in India&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interdisciplinary research team obtained these findings in India, a country with an illiteracy rate of about 39 percent. Poverty still limits access to education in some parts of India, especially for women. Therefore, in this study, nearly all participants were women in their 30s. At the beginning of the training, the majority of them could not decipher a single written word of their mother tongue Hindi. Hindi, one of the official languages of India, is based on Devanagari, a scripture with complex characters describing whole syllables or words rather than single letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants reached a level comparable to a first-grader after only six months of reading training. “This growth of knowledge is remarkable,” says project leader Huettig. “While it is quite difficult for us to learn a new language, it appears to be much easier for us to learn to read. The adult brain proves to be astonishingly flexible.” In principle, this study could also have taken place in Europe. Yet illiteracy is regarded as such a taboo in the West that it would have been immensely difficult to find volunteers to take part. Nevertheless, even in India where the ability to read and write is strongly connected to social class, the project was a tremendous challenge. The scientists recruited volunteers from the same social class in two villages in Northern India to make sure that social factors could not influence the findings. Brain scans were performed in the city of Lucknow, a three hours taxi ride away from participants’ homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new view on dyslexia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impressive learning achievements of the volunteers do not only provide hope for adult illiterates, they also shed new light on the possible cause of reading disorders such as dyslexia. One possible cause for the basic deficits observed in people with dyslexia has previously been attributed to dysfunctions of the thalamus. “Since we found out that only a few months of reading training can modify the thalamus fundamentally, we have to scrutinize this hypothesis,” neuroscientist Skeide explains. It could also be that affected people show different brain activity in the thalamus just because their visual system is less well trained than that of experienced readers. This means that these abnormalities can only be considered an innate cause of dyslexia if they show up prior to schooling. “That’s why only studies that assess children before they start to learn to read and follow them up for several years can bring clarity about the origins of reading disorders,” Huettig adds.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Inside Tesla’s factory, a medical clinic designed to ignore injured workers</title>
<link>https://www.revealnews.org/article/inside-teslas-factory-a-medical-clinic-designed-to-ignore-injured-workers/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.revealnews.org/article/inside-teslas-factory-a-medical-clinic-designed-to-ignore-injured-workers/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;When a worker gets smashed by a car part on Tesla’s factory floor, medical staff are forbidden from calling 911 without permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electric carmaker’s contract doctors rarely grant it, instead often insisting that seriously injured workers – including one who severed the top a finger – be sent to the emergency room in a Lyft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Injured employees have been systematically sent back to the production line to work through their pain with no modifications, according to former clinic employees, Tesla factory workers and medical records. Some could barely walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The on-site medical clinic serving some 10,000 employees at Tesla Inc.’s California assembly plant has failed to properly care for seriously hurt workers, an investigation by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting has found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clinic’s practices are unsafe and unethical, five former clinic employees said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But denying medical care and work restrictions to injured workers is good for one thing: making real injuries disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The goal of the clinic was to keep as many patients off of the books as possible,” said Anna Watson, a physician assistant who worked at Tesla’s medical clinic for three weeks in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson has nearly 20 years of experience as a medical professional, examining patients, diagnosing ailments and prescribing medications. She’s treated patients at a petroleum refinery, a steel plant, emergency rooms and a trauma center. But she said she’s never seen anything like what’s happening at Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_50488&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-50488&quot; src=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Tesla.Anna_.Watson-1-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Tesla.Anna_.Watson-1.jpg 1024w, https://www.revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Tesla.Anna_.Watson-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Tesla.Anna_.Watson-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Tesla.Anna_.Watson-1-740x416.jpg 740w, https://www.revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Tesla.Anna_.Watson-1-504x284.jpg 504w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Anna Watson was a physician assistant at the medical clinic inside Tesla’s electric car factory in Fremont, Calif. She was fired in August after raising concerns.&lt;span class=&quot;media-credit&quot;&gt;Credit: Paul Kuroda for Reveal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The way they were implementing it was very out of control,” said Watson, who was fired in August after she raised her concerns. “Every company that I’ve worked at is motivated to keep things not recordable. But I’ve never seen anybody do it at the expense of treating the patient.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workers with chest pain, breathing problems or extreme headaches have been dismissed as having issues unrelated to their work, without being fully evaluated or having workplace exposures considered, former employees said. The clinic has turned away temp workers who got hurt on Tesla’s assembly lines, leaving them without on-site care. And medical assistants, who are supposed to have on-site supervision, say they were left on their own at night, unprepared to deal with a stream of night-shift injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a work injury requires certain medical equipment – such as stitches or hard braces – then it has to be counted in legally mandated logs. But some employees who needed stitches for a cut instead were given butterfly bandages, said Watson and another former clinic employee. At one point, hard braces were removed from the clinic so they wouldn’t be used, according to Watson and a former medical assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Tesla races to revolutionize the automobile industry and build a more sustainable future, it has left its factory workers in the past, still painfully vulnerable to the dangers of manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/article/tesla-says-its-factory-is-safer-but-it-left-injuries-off-the-books/&quot;&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; by Reveal in April showed that Tesla prioritized style and speed over safety, undercounted injuries and ignored the concerns of its own safety professionals. CEO Elon Musk’s distaste for the color yellow and beeping forklifts eroded factory safety, former safety team members said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new revelations about the on-site clinic show that even as the company forcefully &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/blog/not-so-revealing-story&quot;&gt;pushed&lt;/a&gt; back &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/05/elon-musk-melts-down-blames-scumbag-tesla-critics-for-electing-trump&quot;&gt;against&lt;/a&gt; Reveal’s reporting, behind the scenes, it doubled down on its efforts to hide serious injuries from the government and public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June, Tesla hired a new company, Access Omnicare, to run its factory health center after the company promised Tesla it could help reduce the number of recordable injuries and emergency room visits, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5026522-Access-Omnicare-Tesla-Proposal.html&quot;&gt;records&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former high-level Access Omnicare employee said Tesla pressured the clinic’s owner, who then made his staff dismiss injuries as minor or not related to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was bullying and pressuring to do things people didn’t believe were correct,” said the former employee, whom Reveal granted anonymity because of the worker’s fear of being blackballed in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Basil Besh, the Fremont, California, hand surgeon who owns Access Omnicare, said the clinic drives down Tesla’s injury count with more accurate diagnoses, not because of pressure from Tesla. Injured workers, he said, don’t always understand what’s best for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We treat the Tesla employees just the same way we treat our professional athletes,” he said. “If Steph Curry twists his knee on a Thursday night game, that guy’s in the MRI scanner on Friday morning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet at one point, Watson said a Tesla lawyer and a company safety official told her and other clinic staff to stop prescribing exercises to injured workers so they wouldn’t have to count the injuries. Recommending stretches to treat an injured back or range-of-motion exercises for an injured shoulder was no longer allowed, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, she wrote her friend a text message in outrage: “I had to meet with lawyers yesterday to literally learn how not to take care of people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla declined interview requests for this story and said it had no comment in response to detailed questions. But after Reveal pressed the company for answers, Tesla officials took time on &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/v0U7orfKEhM?t=1044&quot;&gt;their October earnings call&lt;/a&gt; to enthusiastically praise the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m really super happy with the care they’re giving, and I think the employees are as well,” said Laurie Shelby, Tesla’s vice president for environment, health and safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk complained about “unfair accusations” that Tesla undercounts its injuries and promised “first-class health care available right on the spot when people need it.”&lt;/p&gt;

Chiu/Associated Press&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome to the new Tesla &lt;strong&gt;clinic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in June, on stage at Tesla’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/shareholdermeeting&quot;&gt;shareholder meeting&lt;/a&gt;, Musk announced a declining injury rate for his electric car factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a super important thing to me because we obviously owe a great debt to the people who are building the car. I really care about this issue,” Musk said to applause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t long after that that Stephon Nelson joined the company. Working the overnight shift Aug. 13, Nelson got a sudden introduction to Tesla’s new model of care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was bent over putting caulk inside the trunk of a Model X. Something slipped and the hatchback crunched down on his back. Nelson froze up in agonizing pain. He had deep red bruises across his back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I couldn’t walk, I couldn’t sit down. I couldn’t even stand up straight,” said Nelson, who’s 30 and used to play semiprofessional football.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He asked for an ambulance, but the on-call Tesla doctor said no – he could take a Lyft to the hospital instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just felt heartbroken,” Nelson said. “What they was telling us in the orientation, that Tesla is a company that cares about their employees’ safety, it just seemed like it was just a whole reversal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one was allowed to call 911 without a doctor’s permission, said Watson and two medical assistants who used to work at the clinic under Besh’s direction. Anyone who did so would get in trouble, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was a strong push not to send anybody in an ambulance,” Watson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_50487&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-50487&quot; src=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/stephon-nelson2-1024x683.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/stephon-nelson2.jpg 1024w, https://www.revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/stephon-nelson2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/stephon-nelson2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/stephon-nelson2-740x494.jpg 740w, https://www.revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/stephon-nelson2-504x336.jpg 504w, https://www.revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/stephon-nelson2-1012x675.jpg 1012w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;“I couldn’t walk, I couldn’t sit down. I couldn’t even stand up straight,” Stephon Nelson says of what happened when he injured his back while working on a Tesla Model X.&lt;span class=&quot;media-credit&quot;&gt;Credit: Paul Kuroda for Reveal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear why there was such a focus on avoiding 911, though some former employees thought it was to save money. Also, 911 logs become public records. And first responders, unlike drivers for ride-hailing services, are required to report severe work injuries to California’s Division of Occupational Safety and Health, the state’s workplace safety agency. Besh said ambulance use is based on “clinical judgment only.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system was especially problematic on the night shift, as the factory continued churning out vehicles around the clock, but there were no doctors or nurses around, former employees said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two medical assistants who used to work there said they often were left on their own – one on duty at a time – and struggled to tend to all the injured. Both had to do things such as take vital signs, which medical assistants aren’t allowed to do without on-site supervision, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mbc.ca.gov/Licensees/Physicians_and_Surgeons/Medical_Assistants/&quot;&gt;Medical Board of California&lt;/a&gt;. Reveal granted them anonymity because they fear speaking out will hurt their careers. Besh said no one works alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a severely injured worker lying on the assembly line, it could take 10 to 15 minutes for a medical assistant to arrive and then contact on-call doctors, a medical assistant said. Getting a code for Tesla’s Lyft account was a drawn-out process that could take hours, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medical assistants said they were alarmed and uncomfortable with the doctors’ orders to use Lyft because they worried some patients could pass out or need help en route. One worker directed to take a Lyft was light-headed and dizzy. Another had his fingers badly broken, contorted and mangled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besh, who often serves as the on-call doctor, said anyone could call 911 in a life-threatening situation. He said he recommends using Lyft for workers who don’t need advanced life support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besh gave the example of a worker who had the top of his finger cut off. He needed to go to the hospital, but not by ambulance, Besh said. He likened the situation to people at home who get a ride to the hospital instead of calling an ambulance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We right-size the care,” he said. “Obviously, it’s all about the appropriate care given for the appropriate situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a doctor’s judgment call to use Lyft, but many on the factory floor found it inhumane. In some cases, including the worker with an amputated fingertip, factory supervisors refused to put their employees in a Lyft and instead drove them to the hospital, according to a medical assistant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Injured workers sent back to work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Nelson’s case, he called his girlfriend to take him to the hospital. But he said his supervisor told him that he had to show up for work the next day or Nelson would get in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nelson needed the job, so he forced himself to come in. He shuffled slowly, hunched over in pain, to his department, he said. When it was clear he couldn’t do the job, he was sent to the Tesla health center, a small clinic on an upper level of the factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workers too injured to do their regular jobs are supposed to receive job restrictions and a modified assignment that won’t make the injury worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the health center wouldn’t give Nelson any accommodations. He could go home that day, but he had to report to work full duty the following day, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By law, work-related injuries must be recorded on injury logs if they require medical treatment beyond first aid, days away from work or job restrictions. The clinic’s practices were designed to avoid those triggers, said Anna Watson, the physician assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a clinic rule, for example, that injured employees could not be given work restrictions, Watson said. No matter what type of injuries workers came in with – burns, lacerations, strains and sprains – clinic staff were under instructions to send them back to work full duty, she said. Watson said she even had to send one back to work with what appeared to be a broken ankle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical clinics are supposed to treat injuries and keep workers safe, she said, “and none of that’s happening. So at the most acute time of their injury, they don’t have any support, really.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A medical assistant who formerly worked at the clinic remembered an employee who was sent back to work even though he couldn’t stand on one of his feet. Another employee passed out face down on the assembly line – then went back to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You always put back to full duty, no matter what,” said the medical assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Basil Besh said patients are given work restrictions when appropriate. He said those hurt at night get first aid and triage, followed by an accurate diagnosis from a physician the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s always going to be somebody who says, ‘No, I shouldn’t be working,’ ” he said. “But if you look objectively at the totality of the medical examination, that’s not always the case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four days after Nelson’s injury, Watson herself sent him back to work with no restrictions, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5027914-Stephon-Nelson-Medical-Records.html&quot;&gt;medical records&lt;/a&gt; he provided. Nelson said this happened repeatedly as he hobbled in pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Watson did what she could to help: She referred him to Access Omnicare’s main clinic&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; about 5 miles from the auto factory. It was allowed to give work restrictions, Watson said. But most workers aren’t sent there, and it can take a while to get an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight days after his injury, the outside clinic diagnosed Nelson with a “crushing injury of back,” contusions and “intractable” pain. He finally was given work restrictions that said he shouldn’t be bending, squatting, kneeling, climbing stairs or lifting more than 10 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after that, the health center at one point sent Nelson back to his department in a wheelchair, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And I’m rocking back and forth, just ready to fall out of the wheelchair because I’m in so much pain,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, Nelson got a warehouse job at another company. It was a pay cut, but he quit Tesla right away. “I feel like it’s really not safe at all,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besh said he couldn’t comment on a specific case without a signed release from the patient. But, he said, “a physician examined that patient and saw that there was not a safety issue.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;excerpt-copy&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being called out for hiding worker injuries at its factory, Tesla decides to double down. Plus, a report card on diversity in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besh was &lt;a href=&quot;http://aaos-annualmeeting-presskit.org/2018/awards-announcements/chair_of_boc_besh/&quot;&gt;named&lt;/a&gt; chairman of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons’ Board of Councilors this year. A Tesla spokeswoman set up and monitored his interview with Reveal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s been a “culture shift” at the health center since Tesla hired him to take over, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So culturally, there were folks in the past who were expecting that any time they come to the clinic, they would be taken off of work,” he said. “And when we told them, ‘No, we really want to do what’s best for you’ … it’s taking some time to get buy-in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, Tesla counted Nelson on its injury logs, which is how Reveal identified him. That’s another reason the system didn’t make sense to Watson: Some workers whose injuries were so serious that they eventually would have to be counted still were denied proper care when they needed it most, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many more injured workers never were counted, she said. Tesla’s official injury logs, provided to Reveal by a former employee, show &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/August2018Tesla300Logsredacted.pdf&quot;&gt;48 injuries&lt;/a&gt; in August. Watson reviewed the list for the three weeks she was there and estimated that more than twice as many injuries should have been counted if Tesla had provided appropriate care and counted accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other ways Tesla’s clinic avoids treating workers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clinic seemed geared toward sending workers away instead of treating them, Watson said. The culture of the clinic, she said, was to discount workers’ complaints and assume they were exaggerating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clinic would look for reasons to dismiss injuries as not work-related, even when they seemed to be, former employees said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson recalled one worker who had passed out on the job and went to the hospital because of her exposure to fumes in the factory. Even though a work-related loss of consciousness is required to be counted, no such injury was recorded on Tesla’s injury logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temp workers hurt on the production line also were often rebuffed by the clinic, said former clinic employees. At one point, there was a blanket policy to turn away temps, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_50489&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-50489&quot; src=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tracy-lee-1024x683.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tracy-lee.jpg 1024w, https://www.revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tracy-lee-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tracy-lee-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tracy-lee-740x494.jpg 740w, https://www.revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tracy-lee-504x336.jpg 504w, https://www.revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tracy-lee-1012x675.jpg 1012w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Tracy Lee wears a brace to help with a repetitive stress injury she developed while working at Tesla’s factory. She says the in-house health center sent her away without evaluating her because she wasn’t a permanent employee.&lt;span class=&quot;media-credit&quot;&gt;Credit: Paul Kuroda for Reveal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracy Lee developed a repetitive stress injury over the summer when a machine broke and she had to lift car parts by hand, she said. Lee said the health center sent her away without evaluating her because she wasn’t a permanent employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I really think that’s messed up,” said Lee, who later sought medical treatment on her own. “Don’t discriminate just because we’re temps. We’re working for you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By law, Tesla is required to record injuries of temp workers who work under its supervision, no matter where they get treatment. But not all of them were. Lee said her Tesla supervisor knew about the injury. But Lee’s name doesn’t appear on Tesla’s injury logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besh pushed back on the claims of his former employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the clinic didn’t treat some temp workers because Access Omnicare wasn’t a designated health care provider for their staffing agencies. About half of the agencies now are able to use the clinic, and the rest should be early next year, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besh said a physician accurately and carefully determines whether an injury is work-related and the clinic is not set up to treat personal medical issues. He said the clinic is fully stocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for prescribing exercises, Besh said the clinic automatically was giving exercise recommendations to workers who were not injured and simply fixed the error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;blk-box wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;sec-title&quot;&gt;Work Status Reports&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;These sample Work Status Reports, posted in Tesla’s health center, show how clinic staff were instructed to handle different situations. The document on the left, labeled “Work Related,” is marked “First Aid Only” and “Return to full duty with no limitations or restrictions,” scenarios that would mean Tesla wouldn’t have to count the injury. Those were the only options, says Anna Watson, a physician assistant who used to work there. One document for contract employees such as temp workers (center) and another for non-occupational injuries (right) both say to refer the patients elsewhere. &lt;span class=&quot;media-credit&quot;&gt;Credit: Obtained by Reveal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinic source: Tesla pressured doctor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access Omnicare’s proposal for running Tesla’s health center states that Tesla’s priorities include reducing recordable injuries and emergency room visits, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5026522-Access-Omnicare-Tesla-Proposal.html&quot;&gt;copy&lt;/a&gt; obtained by Reveal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It says Access Omnicare’s model, with more accurate diagnoses, reduces “un-necessary use of Emergency Departments and prevents inadvertent over-reporting of OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) recordability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before Access Omnicare took over the on-site health center in June, Tesla sent many injured workers to its main clinic as one of the automaker’s preferred providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla exercised an alarming amount of pressure on the clinic to alter how it treated patients in order to keep injury rates down, said the former high-level Access Omnicare employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was a huge, huge push from Tesla to keep things nonrecordable,” said the former employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Tesla workers’ compensation official routinely would contact the clinic to intervene in individual cases, said the former employee. Tesla would take issue with diagnoses and treatment decisions, arguing that specific workers should be sent back to work full duty or have their injuries labeled as unrelated to work. The clinic gave Tesla what it wanted, the former employee said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Bill Casillas’ diagnosis suddenly was changed by Access Omnicare after discussions with Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, Casillas was working in Tesla’s seat factory. When he touched a forklift, he felt an electric shock jolt him back. Later that shift, it happened again. He said he felt disoriented and found he had urinated on himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casillas said he hasn’t been the same since. He struggles with pain, tingling and numbness. At 47, he’s unsteady, uses a cane and hasn’t been able to work, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A doctor at Access Omnicare diagnosed a work-related “injury due to electrical exposure” and gave him severe work restrictions and physical therapy, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5026902-Casillas-Original-Diagnosis.html&quot;&gt;medical records&lt;/a&gt; show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, nearly two months after his injury, another Access Omnicare physician, Dr. Muhannad Hafi, stepped in and dismissed the injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have spoken again with (the workers’ compensation official) at Tesla and he informed that the forklift did not have electric current running. With that said, in my medical opinion, the patient does not have an industrial injury attributed to an electrical current,” he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5026903-Casillas-Hafi-Report.html#document/p3/a464487&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hafi, who’s no longer with Access Omnicare, didn’t respond to questions. Besh said he can’t discuss patient details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The co-worker who was in the forklift during the second shock, Paul Calderon, said he disagrees with the Tesla official but no one asked him. He backed up Casillas’ account and said Tesla “tried to really downplay what happened to him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hafi’s January &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5026903-Casillas-Hafi-Report.html&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; noted that Casillas said he was “miserable,” used a cane and had pain all over his body. But he discharged him back to work full duty, writing, “No further symptoms of concern.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Tesla safety team manager informed Casillas last month that his injury was not counted because it was “determined to not be work-related.” Casillas is still a Tesla employee, but he’s off work because of his injury. His workers’ comp claim was denied based on Hafi’s report, but his lawyer, Sue Borg, is seeking an independent medical evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besh said Tesla does not pressure him to dismiss injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What Tesla pressures us on is accurate documentation,” he said. “What they want is their OSHA log to be as accurate as possible, so what they’ll push back on is, ‘Doctor I need more clarity on this report.’ And we do that for them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They are not in the business of making clinical determinations at all,” he said. “We make those clinical determinations only based on what the patient needs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State regulators not interested&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By late August, Watson, the physician assistant, reached her breaking point. She got into an argument with Besh, who fired her for not deferring to doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterward, she filed a complaint to Cal/OSHA, California’s workplace safety agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just see the workers at Tesla as having absolutely no voice,” she said. “I do feel extra responsible to try to speak up for what’s going on there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson thought Cal/OSHA would put an immediate stop to the practices she witnessed. But the agency wasn’t interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cal/OSHA sent her a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5026864-Watson-CalOSHA-Response.html&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; saying it folded her complaint into the investigation it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/blog/tesla-hit-by-government-investigation-after-reveal-story/&quot;&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; in April after Reveal’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/article/tesla-says-its-factory-is-safer-but-it-left-injuries-off-the-books/&quot;&gt;first story&lt;/a&gt; ran. The letter said it had investigated and cited Tesla for a recordkeeping violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Cal/OSHA already had closed that investigation two weeks before Watson’s complaint. The agency &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5026853-CalOSHA-Recordkeeping-Citation.html&quot;&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; a fine of $400 for a single injury it said was not recorded within the required time period. Tesla appealed, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/blog/one-year-in-tesla-update&quot;&gt;calling&lt;/a&gt; it an administrative error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reveal had documented many other cases of injuries that Tesla had failed to record. But the agency had only about six months from the date of an injury to fine a company. By the time Cal/OSHA concluded its four-month investigation, the statute of limitations had run out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Reveal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/article/tesla-left-injuries-off-the-books-but-it-might-not-face-penalties/&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the time limitation makes it difficult to hold employers accountable, state legislators passed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB2334&quot;&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt; giving investigators six months from when Cal/OSHA first learns of the violation. It was signed by Gov. Jerry Brown, but it was too late for the Tesla investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Cal/OSHA spokeswoman said the investigation found four other “injury recording violations that fell outside of the statute of limitations.” Even if those other violations had been included, the spokeswoman said Cal/OSHA would have had to combine them in a single $400 citation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla, meanwhile, inaccurately cites Cal/OSHA’s investigation as vindication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We do get these quite unfair accusations,” Musk said on his October earnings call. “One of them was that we were underreporting injuries. And it’s worth noting that OSHA completed their investigation and concluded that we had  not been doing anything of the sort.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson called Cal/OSHA officials to insist they investigate her complaint. She told them that she had detailed knowledge of a system that undercounted injuries by failing to treat injured workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Cal/OSHA officials told her that it wasn’t the agency’s responsibility, she said. They suggested contacting another agency, such as the medical board or workers’ compensation regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Watson kept pushing and Reveal began asking questions, a Cal/OSHA spokeswoman said her complaint now is being investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson has a new job at an urgent care clinic. She said she just wants someone to make sure that Tesla workers get the care they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You go to Tesla and you think it’s going to be this innovative, great, wonderful place to be, like this kind of futuristic company,” she said. “And I guess it’s just kind of disappointing that that’s our future, basically, where the worker still doesn’t matter.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Inside Tesla’s factory, a medical clinic designed to ignore injured workers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a worker gets smashed by a car part on Tesla’s factory floor, medical staff are forbidden from calling 911 without permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electric carmaker’s contract doctors rarely grant it, instead often insisting that seriously injured workers – including one who severed the top a finger – be sent to the emergency room in a Lyft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Injured employees have been systematically sent back to the production line to work through their pain with no modifications, according to former clinic employees, Tesla factory workers and medical records. Some could barely walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The on-site medical clinic serving some 10,000 employees at Tesla Inc.’s California assembly plant has failed to properly care for seriously hurt workers, an investigation by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting has found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clinic’s practices are unsafe and unethical, five former clinic employees said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But denying medical care and work restrictions to injured workers is good for one thing: making real injuries disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The goal of the clinic was to keep as many patients off of the books as possible,” said Anna Watson, a physician assistant who worked at Tesla’s medical clinic for three weeks in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson has nearly 20 years of experience as a medical professional, examining patients, diagnosing ailments and prescribing medications. She’s treated patients at a petroleum refinery, a steel plant, emergency rooms and a trauma center. But she said she’s never seen anything like what’s happening at Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The way they were implementing it was very out of control,” said Watson, who was fired in August after she raised her concerns. “Every company that I’ve worked at is motivated to keep things not recordable. But I’ve never seen anybody do it at the expense of treating the patient.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workers with chest pain, breathing problems or extreme headaches have been dismissed as having issues unrelated to their work, without being fully evaluated or having workplace exposures considered, former employees said. The clinic has turned away temp workers who got hurt on Tesla’s assembly lines, leaving them without on-site care. And medical assistants, who are supposed to have on-site supervision, say they were left on their own at night, unprepared to deal with a stream of night-shift injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a work injury requires certain medical equipment – such as stitches or hard braces – then it has to be counted in legally mandated logs. But some employees who needed stitches for a cut instead were given butterfly bandages, said Watson and another former clinic employee. At one point, hard braces were removed from the clinic so they wouldn’t be used, according to Watson and a former medical assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Tesla races to revolutionize the automobile industry and build a more sustainable future, it has left its factory workers in the past, still painfully vulnerable to the dangers of manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/article/tesla-says-its-factory-is-safer-but-it-left-injuries-off-the-books/&quot;&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; by Reveal in April showed that Tesla prioritized style and speed over safety, undercounted injuries and ignored the concerns of its own safety professionals. CEO Elon Musk’s distaste for the color yellow and beeping forklifts eroded factory safety, former safety team members said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new revelations about the on-site clinic show that even as the company forcefully &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/blog/not-so-revealing-story&quot;&gt;pushed&lt;/a&gt; back &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/05/elon-musk-melts-down-blames-scumbag-tesla-critics-for-electing-trump&quot;&gt;against&lt;/a&gt; Reveal’s reporting, behind the scenes, it doubled down on its efforts to hide serious injuries from the government and public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June, Tesla hired a new company, Access Omnicare, to run its factory health center after the company promised Tesla it could help reduce the number of recordable injuries and emergency room visits, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5026522-Access-Omnicare-Tesla-Proposal.html&quot;&gt;records&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former high-level Access Omnicare employee said Tesla pressured the clinic’s owner, who then made his staff dismiss injuries as minor or not related to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was bullying and pressuring to do things people didn’t believe were correct,” said the former employee, whom Reveal granted anonymity because of the worker’s fear of being blackballed in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Basil Besh, the Fremont, California, hand surgeon who owns Access Omnicare, said the clinic drives down Tesla’s injury count with more accurate diagnoses, not because of pressure from Tesla. Injured workers, he said, don’t always understand what’s best for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We treat the Tesla employees just the same way we treat our professional athletes,” he said. “If Steph Curry twists his knee on a Thursday night game, that guy’s in the MRI scanner on Friday morning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet at one point, Watson said a Tesla lawyer and a company safety official told her and other clinic staff to stop prescribing exercises to injured workers so they wouldn’t have to count the injuries. Recommending stretches to treat an injured back or range-of-motion exercises for an injured shoulder was no longer allowed, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, she wrote her friend a text message in outrage: “I had to meet with lawyers yesterday to literally learn how not to take care of people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla declined interview requests for this story and said it had no comment in response to detailed questions. But after Reveal pressed the company for answers, Tesla officials took time on &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/v0U7orfKEhM?t=1044&quot;&gt;their October earnings call&lt;/a&gt; to enthusiastically praise the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m really super happy with the care they’re giving, and I think the employees are as well,” said Laurie Shelby, Tesla’s vice president for environment, health and safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk complained about “unfair accusations” that Tesla undercounts its injuries and promised “first-class health care available right on the spot when people need it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in June, on stage at Tesla’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/shareholdermeeting&quot;&gt;shareholder meeting&lt;/a&gt;, Musk announced a declining injury rate for his electric car factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a super important thing to me because we obviously owe a great debt to the people who are building the car. I really care about this issue,” Musk said to applause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t long after that that Stephon Nelson joined the company. Working the overnight shift Aug. 13, Nelson got a sudden introduction to Tesla’s new model of care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was bent over putting caulk inside the trunk of a Model X. Something slipped and the hatchback crunched down on his back. Nelson froze up in agonizing pain. He had deep red bruises across his back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I couldn’t walk, I couldn’t sit down. I couldn’t even stand up straight,” said Nelson, who’s 30 and used to play semiprofessional football.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He asked for an ambulance, but the on-call Tesla doctor said no – he could take a Lyft to the hospital instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just felt heartbroken,” Nelson said. “What they was telling us in the orientation, that Tesla is a company that cares about their employees’ safety, it just seemed like it was just a whole reversal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one was allowed to call 911 without a doctor’s permission, said Watson and two medical assistants who used to work at the clinic under Besh’s direction. Anyone who did so would get in trouble, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was a strong push not to send anybody in an ambulance,” Watson said.&lt;/p&gt;
“I couldn’t walk, I couldn’t sit down. I couldn’t even stand up straight,” Stephon Nelson says of what happened when he injured his back while working on a Tesla Model X.Credit: Paul Kuroda for Reveal
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear why there was such a focus on avoiding 911, though some former employees thought it was to save money. Also, 911 logs become public records. And first responders, unlike drivers for ride-hailing services, are required to report severe work injuries to California’s Division of Occupational Safety and Health, the state’s workplace safety agency. Besh said ambulance use is based on “clinical judgment only.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system was especially problematic on the night shift, as the factory continued churning out vehicles around the clock, but there were no doctors or nurses around, former employees said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two medical assistants who used to work there said they often were left on their own – one on duty at a time – and struggled to tend to all the injured. Both had to do things such as take vital signs, which medical assistants aren’t allowed to do without on-site supervision, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mbc.ca.gov/Licensees/Physicians_and_Surgeons/Medical_Assistants/&quot;&gt;Medical Board of California&lt;/a&gt;. Reveal granted them anonymity because they fear speaking out will hurt their careers. Besh said no one works alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a severely injured worker lying on the assembly line, it could take 10 to 15 minutes for a medical assistant to arrive and then contact on-call doctors, a medical assistant said. Getting a code for Tesla’s Lyft account was a drawn-out process that could take hours, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medical assistants said they were alarmed and uncomfortable with the doctors’ orders to use Lyft because they worried some patients could pass out or need help en route. One worker directed to take a Lyft was light-headed and dizzy. Another had his fingers badly broken, contorted and mangled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besh, who often serves as the on-call doctor, said anyone could call 911 in a life-threatening situation. He said he recommends using Lyft for workers who don’t need advanced life support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besh gave the example of a worker who had the top of his finger cut off. He needed to go to the hospital, but not by ambulance, Besh said. He likened the situation to people at home who get a ride to the hospital instead of calling an ambulance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We right-size the care,” he said. “Obviously, it’s all about the appropriate care given for the appropriate situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a doctor’s judgment call to use Lyft, but many on the factory floor found it inhumane. In some cases, including the worker with an amputated fingertip, factory supervisors refused to put their employees in a Lyft and instead drove them to the hospital, according to a medical assistant.&lt;/p&gt;

Injured workers sent back to work
&lt;p&gt;In Nelson’s case, he called his girlfriend to take him to the hospital. But he said his supervisor told him that he had to show up for work the next day or Nelson would get in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nelson needed the job, so he forced himself to come in. He shuffled slowly, hunched over in pain, to his department, he said. When it was clear he couldn’t do the job, he was sent to the Tesla health center, a small clinic on an upper level of the factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workers too injured to do their regular jobs are supposed to receive job restrictions and a modified assignment that won’t make the injury worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the health center wouldn’t give Nelson any accommodations. He could go home that day, but he had to report to work full duty the following day, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By law, work-related injuries must be recorded on injury logs if they require medical treatment beyond first aid, days away from work or job restrictions. The clinic’s practices were designed to avoid those triggers, said Anna Watson, the physician assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a clinic rule, for example, that injured employees could not be given work restrictions, Watson said. No matter what type of injuries workers came in with – burns, lacerations, strains and sprains – clinic staff were under instructions to send them back to work full duty, she said. Watson said she even had to send one back to work with what appeared to be a broken ankle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical clinics are supposed to treat injuries and keep workers safe, she said, “and none of that’s happening. So at the most acute time of their injury, they don’t have any support, really.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A medical assistant who formerly worked at the clinic remembered an employee who was sent back to work even though he couldn’t stand on one of his feet. Another employee passed out face down on the assembly line – then went back to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You always put back to full duty, no matter what,” said the medical assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Basil Besh said patients are given work restrictions when appropriate. He said those hurt at night get first aid and triage, followed by an accurate diagnosis from a physician the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s always going to be somebody who says, ‘No, I shouldn’t be working,’ ” he said. “But if you look objectively at the totality of the medical examination, that’s not always the case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four days after Nelson’s injury, Watson herself sent him back to work with no restrictions, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5027914-Stephon-Nelson-Medical-Records.html&quot;&gt;medical records&lt;/a&gt; he provided. Nelson said this happened repeatedly as he hobbled in pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Watson did what she could to help: She referred him to Access Omnicare’s main clinic, about 5 miles from the auto factory. It was allowed to give work restrictions, Watson said. But most workers aren’t sent there, and it can take a while to get an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight days after his injury, the outside clinic diagnosed Nelson with a “crushing injury of back,” contusions and “intractable” pain. He finally was given work restrictions that said he shouldn’t be bending, squatting, kneeling, climbing stairs or lifting more than 10 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after that, the health center at one point sent Nelson back to his department in a wheelchair, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And I’m rocking back and forth, just ready to fall out of the wheelchair because I’m in so much pain,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, Nelson got a warehouse job at another company. It was a pay cut, but he quit Tesla right away. “I feel like it’s really not safe at all,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besh said he couldn’t comment on a specific case without a signed release from the patient. But, he said, “a physician examined that patient and saw that there was not a safety issue.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;excerpt-copy&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being called out for hiding worker injuries at its factory, Tesla decides to double down. Plus, a report card on diversity in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besh was &lt;a href=&quot;http://aaos-annualmeeting-presskit.org/2018/awards-announcements/chair_of_boc_besh/&quot;&gt;named&lt;/a&gt; chairman of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons’ Board of Councilors this year. A Tesla spokeswoman set up and monitored his interview with Reveal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s been a “culture shift” at the health center since Tesla hired him to take over, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So culturally, there were folks in the past who were expecting that any time they come to the clinic, they would be taken off of work,” he said. “And when we told them, ‘No, we really want to do what’s best for you’ … it’s taking some time to get buy-in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, Tesla counted Nelson on its injury logs, which is how Reveal identified him. That’s another reason the system didn’t make sense to Watson: Some workers whose injuries were so serious that they eventually would have to be counted still were denied proper care when they needed it most, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many more injured workers never were counted, she said. Tesla’s official injury logs, provided to Reveal by a former employee, show &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/August2018Tesla300Logsredacted.pdf&quot;&gt;48 injuries&lt;/a&gt; in August. Watson reviewed the list for the three weeks she was there and estimated that more than twice as many injuries should have been counted if Tesla had provided appropriate care and counted accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
Other ways Tesla’s clinic avoids treating workers
&lt;p&gt;The clinic seemed geared toward sending workers away instead of treating them, Watson said. The culture of the clinic, she said, was to discount workers’ complaints and assume they were exaggerating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clinic would look for reasons to dismiss injuries as not work-related, even when they seemed to be, former employees said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson recalled one worker who had passed out on the job and went to the hospital because of her exposure to fumes in the factory. Even though a work-related loss of consciousness is required to be counted, no such injury was recorded on Tesla’s injury logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temp workers hurt on the production line also were often rebuffed by the clinic, said former clinic employees. At one point, there was a blanket policy to turn away temps, they said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tracy Lee developed a repetitive stress injury over the summer when a machine broke and she had to lift car parts by hand, she said. Lee said the health center sent her away without evaluating her because she wasn’t a permanent employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I really think that’s messed up,” said Lee, who later sought medical treatment on her own. “Don’t discriminate just because we’re temps. We’re working for you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By law, Tesla is required to record injuries of temp workers who work under its supervision, no matter where they get treatment. But not all of them were. Lee said her Tesla supervisor knew about the injury. But Lee’s name doesn’t appear on Tesla’s injury logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besh pushed back on the claims of his former employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the clinic didn’t treat some temp workers because Access Omnicare wasn’t a designated health care provider for their staffing agencies. About half of the agencies now are able to use the clinic, and the rest should be early next year, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besh said a physician accurately and carefully determines whether an injury is work-related and the clinic is not set up to treat personal medical issues. He said the clinic is fully stocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for prescribing exercises, Besh said the clinic automatically was giving exercise recommendations to workers who were not injured and simply fixed the error.&lt;/p&gt;
Work Status Reports   
&lt;p&gt;These sample Work Status Reports, posted in Tesla’s health center, show how clinic staff were instructed to handle different situations. The document on the left, labeled “Work Related,” is marked “First Aid Only” and “Return to full duty with no limitations or restrictions,” scenarios that would mean Tesla wouldn’t have to count the injury. Those were the only options, says Anna Watson, a physician assistant who used to work there. One document for contract employees such as temp workers (center) and another for non-occupational injuries (right) both say to refer the patients elsewhere. Credit: Obtained by Reveal&lt;/p&gt;

Clinic source: Tesla pressured doctor
&lt;p&gt;Access Omnicare’s proposal for running Tesla’s health center states that Tesla’s priorities include reducing recordable injuries and emergency room visits, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5026522-Access-Omnicare-Tesla-Proposal.html&quot;&gt;copy&lt;/a&gt; obtained by Reveal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It says Access Omnicare’s model, with more accurate diagnoses, reduces “un-necessary use of Emergency Departments and prevents inadvertent over-reporting of OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) recordability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before Access Omnicare took over the on-site health center in June, Tesla sent many injured workers to its main clinic as one of the automaker’s preferred providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla exercised an alarming amount of pressure on the clinic to alter how it treated patients in order to keep injury rates down, said the former high-level Access Omnicare employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was a huge, huge push from Tesla to keep things nonrecordable,” said the former employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Tesla workers’ compensation official routinely would contact the clinic to intervene in individual cases, said the former employee. Tesla would take issue with diagnoses and treatment decisions, arguing that specific workers should be sent back to work full duty or have their injuries labeled as unrelated to work. The clinic gave Tesla what it wanted, the former employee said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Bill Casillas’ diagnosis suddenly was changed by Access Omnicare after discussions with Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, Casillas was working in Tesla’s seat factory. When he touched a forklift, he felt an electric shock jolt him back. Later that shift, it happened again. He said he felt disoriented and found he had urinated on himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casillas said he hasn’t been the same since. He struggles with pain, tingling and numbness. At 47, he’s unsteady, uses a cane and hasn’t been able to work, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A doctor at Access Omnicare diagnosed a work-related “injury due to electrical exposure” and gave him severe work restrictions and physical therapy, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5026902-Casillas-Original-Diagnosis.html&quot;&gt;medical records&lt;/a&gt; show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, nearly two months after his injury, another Access Omnicare physician, Dr. Muhannad Hafi, stepped in and dismissed the injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have spoken again with (the workers’ compensation official) at Tesla and he informed that the forklift did not have electric current running. With that said, in my medical opinion, the patient does not have an industrial injury attributed to an electrical current,” he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5026903-Casillas-Hafi-Report.html#document/p3/a464487&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hafi, who’s no longer with Access Omnicare, didn’t respond to questions. Besh said he can’t discuss patient details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The co-worker who was in the forklift during the second shock, Paul Calderon, said he disagrees with the Tesla official but no one asked him. He backed up Casillas’ account and said Tesla “tried to really downplay what happened to him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hafi’s January &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5026903-Casillas-Hafi-Report.html&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; noted that Casillas said he was “miserable,” used a cane and had pain all over his body. But he discharged him back to work full duty, writing, “No further symptoms of concern.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Tesla safety team manager informed Casillas last month that his injury was not counted because it was “determined to not be work-related.” Casillas is still a Tesla employee, but he’s off work because of his injury. His workers’ comp claim was denied based on Hafi’s report, but his lawyer, Sue Borg, is seeking an independent medical evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besh said Tesla does not pressure him to dismiss injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What Tesla pressures us on is accurate documentation,” he said. “What they want is their OSHA log to be as accurate as possible, so what they’ll push back on is, ‘Doctor I need more clarity on this report.’ And we do that for them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They are not in the business of making clinical determinations at all,” he said. “We make those clinical determinations only based on what the patient needs.”&lt;/p&gt;
State regulators not interested
&lt;p&gt;By late August, Watson, the physician assistant, reached her breaking point. She got into an argument with Besh, who fired her for not deferring to doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterward, she filed a complaint to Cal/OSHA, California’s workplace safety agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just see the workers at Tesla as having absolutely no voice,” she said. “I do feel extra responsible to try to speak up for what’s going on there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson thought Cal/OSHA would put an immediate stop to the practices she witnessed. But the agency wasn’t interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cal/OSHA sent her a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5026864-Watson-CalOSHA-Response.html&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; saying it folded her complaint into the investigation it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/blog/tesla-hit-by-government-investigation-after-reveal-story/&quot;&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; in April after Reveal’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/article/tesla-says-its-factory-is-safer-but-it-left-injuries-off-the-books/&quot;&gt;first story&lt;/a&gt; ran. The letter said it had investigated and cited Tesla for a recordkeeping violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Cal/OSHA already had closed that investigation two weeks before Watson’s complaint. The agency &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5026853-CalOSHA-Recordkeeping-Citation.html&quot;&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; a fine of $400 for a single injury it said was not recorded within the required time period. Tesla appealed, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/blog/one-year-in-tesla-update&quot;&gt;calling&lt;/a&gt; it an administrative error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reveal had documented many other cases of injuries that Tesla had failed to record. But the agency had only about six months from the date of an injury to fine a company. By the time Cal/OSHA concluded its four-month investigation, the statute of limitations had run out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Reveal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/article/tesla-left-injuries-off-the-books-but-it-might-not-face-penalties/&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the time limitation makes it difficult to hold employers accountable, state legislators passed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB2334&quot;&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt; giving investigators six months from when Cal/OSHA first learns of the violation. It was signed by Gov. Jerry Brown, but it was too late for the Tesla investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Cal/OSHA spokeswoman said the investigation found four other “injury recording violations that fell outside of the statute of limitations.” Even if those other violations had been included, the spokeswoman said Cal/OSHA would have had to combine them in a single $400 citation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla, meanwhile, inaccurately cites Cal/OSHA’s investigation as vindication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We do get these quite unfair accusations,” Musk said on his October earnings call. “One of them was that we were underreporting injuries. And it’s worth noting that OSHA completed their investigation and concluded that we had  not been doing anything of the sort.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson called Cal/OSHA officials to insist they investigate her complaint. She told them that she had detailed knowledge of a system that undercounted injuries by failing to treat injured workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Cal/OSHA officials told her that it wasn’t the agency’s responsibility, she said. They suggested contacting another agency, such as the medical board or workers’ compensation regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Watson kept pushing and Reveal began asking questions, a Cal/OSHA spokeswoman said her complaint now is being investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson has a new job at an urgent care clinic. She said she just wants someone to make sure that Tesla workers get the care they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You go to Tesla and you think it’s going to be this innovative, great, wonderful place to be, like this kind of futuristic company,” she said. “And I guess it’s just kind of disappointing that that’s our future, basically, where the worker still doesn’t matter.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Microsoft Beats Amazon in 12-Month Cloud Revenue</title>

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Microsoft rang up $$8.5 billion in commercial-cloud revenue for the quarter as CEO Satya Nadella described Azure's breakaway momentum.&lt;small class=&quot;article-photo-credit&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CLOUD WARS -- Microsoft’s booming $8.5-billion in cloud revenue last quarter has helped it open a decisive lead over Amazon as the world’s leading enterprise cloud provider for the past 12 months, $26.7 billion to $23.4$ billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Amazon’s AWS cloud unit put up &lt;a href=&quot;https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazoncom-announces-third-quarter-sales-29-566-billion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazoncom-announces-third-quarter-sales-29-566-billion&quot;&gt;another set of great numbers for the quarter&lt;/a&gt; ended Sept. 30—$6.68 billion in revenue, up 46%—Microsoft’s fiscal first quarter was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobevans1/2018/07/26/why-amazon-cant-match-microsoft-in-the-cloud-10-insights-from-satya-nadella/#5dc8e5d41fb8&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobevans1/2018/07/26/why-amazon-cant-match-microsoft-in-the-cloud-10-insights-from-satya-nadella/#5dc8e5d41fb8&quot;&gt;simply better and reflected its continued strength across every facet&lt;/a&gt; of the white-hot enterprise-cloud market, with commercial-cloud revenue at 47%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some highlights for the 3 months ended Sept. 30:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Azure revenue up 76%;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamics 365 up 51% in the SaaS layer;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamics 365 revenue expected to hit $1.25 billion for the fiscal year (ending June 30, 2019); and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LinkedIn revenue up 33% to about $1.5 billion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his prepared remarks on Microsoft’s earnings call last week, CEO Satya Nadella offered this perspective on &lt;a href=&quot;https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://c.s-microsoft.com/en-us/CMSFiles/TranscriptFY19Q1.docx?version=9eceeee6-b256-e063-a6a9-9788251db79e&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://c.s-microsoft.com/en-us/CMSFiles/TranscriptFY19Q1.docx?version=9eceeee6-b256-e063-a6a9-9788251db79e&quot;&gt;the centerpiece of the Microsoft cloud: “Azure&lt;/a&gt; is the only hyperscale cloud that extends to the edge across identity, data, application platform and security and management. We introduced 100 new Azure capabilities this quarter alone, focused on both existing workloads like security and new workloads like IoT and Edge AI.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For AWS, some analysts and media outlets made a big to-do about the fact that the rate of growth for Amazon’s cloud business took a tiny downward turn for the quarter, slipping from 49% to 46%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that’s an overblown detail—if you look at the last several quarters, AWS has consistently achieved the remarkable feat of having its growth rate increase even as it has approached an annualized run rate of $25 billion. Starting with Q4 of 2016, the revenue-growth rate for AWS has been 42%, 42%, 44%, 48%, 49% and most recently 46%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very same minor decline in rate of growth occurred at Microsoft as well—its commercial-cloud revenue for the period ending June 30 was 53%, and then for the 3 months ending Sept. 30, that slipped to 47%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty much inevitable that as the cloud businesses of Microsoft and Amazon reach this type of scale--$26.7 billion in revenue for the past 12 months for Microsoft, and $23.4 billion for Amazon—growth rates will eventually decline. But if somebody’s got a problem with 47% growth for $25-billion businesses, then I’d say that person doesn’t have a clue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For IBM, its cloud business was one of the few bright spots in a largely challenging quarter as it posted $19 billion in cloud revenue for the 12 months ending Sept. 30, with the “as a service” portion of the IBM Cloud racking up $11.4 billion in revenue, up 24%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yesterday, IBM took a huge step to scale its cloud business by agreeing to acquire Red Hat for $34 billion, an acquisition that would add about $3 billion to IBM’s annual cloud revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Microsoft and Amazon, the competition over the next year will center on more than advanced cloud and AI technology as Microsoft continues to hammer on Amazon’s aggressive corporate strategy of jumping into an expanding array of industries and pitting itself as a direct competitor of businesses that might otherwise be viable prospects for AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Nadella said in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://c.s-microsoft.com/en-us/CMSFiles/TranscriptFY19Q1.docx?version=9eceeee6-b256-e063-a6a9-9788251db79e&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://c.s-microsoft.com/en-us/CMSFiles/TranscriptFY19Q1.docx?version=9eceeee6-b256-e063-a6a9-9788251db79e&quot;&gt;opening remarks on the earnings call&lt;/a&gt;, “Our cloud platforms and tools enable our customers to build tech intensity while ensuring we are addressing their tough questions around trust – both trust in technology and trust that they have a partner whose business model is aligned to their success. No customer wants to be dependent on a provider that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobevans1/2018/06/29/will-amazon-damage-its-cloud-business-by-competing-directly-against-aws-customers/#68c6da0d2999&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobevans1/2018/06/29/will-amazon-damage-its-cloud-business-by-competing-directly-against-aws-customers/#68c6da0d2999&quot;&gt;sells them technology on one end and competes with them on the other&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

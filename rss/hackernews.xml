<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://medium.com/@cfatechblog/edge-computing-at-chick-fil-a-7d67242675e2</guid>
<description>&lt;p name=&quot;6649&quot; id=&quot;6649&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;by Brian Chambers, Caleb Hurd, Sean Drucker, Alex Crane, Morgan McEntire, Jamie Roberts, and Laura Jauch (the Chick-fil-A IOT/Edge team)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6748&quot; id=&quot;6748&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@cfatechblog/bare-metal-k8s-clustering-at-chick-fil-a-scale-7b0607bd3541&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@cfatechblog/bare-metal-k8s-clustering-at-chick-fil-a-scale-7b0607bd3541&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, we shared about how we do bare metal clustering for Kubernetes on-the-fly at the Edge in our restaurants. One of the most common (and best) questions we got was “but why?”. In the post we will answer that question. If you are interested in more or prefer video to text, you can also check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-chambers/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-chambers/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/calebrhurd/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/calebrhurd/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Caleb’s&lt;/a&gt; presentation at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infoq.com/presentations/chick-fil-a-k8-clusters&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.infoq.com/presentations/chick-fil-a-k8-clusters&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;QConNY 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 name=&quot;5fb1&quot; id=&quot;5fb1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Why K8s in a restaurant?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2635&quot; id=&quot;2635&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Why does a restaurant company like Chick-fil-A want to deploy Kubernetes at the Edge? What are the goals? That, we can answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;3b2a&quot; id=&quot;3b2a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Low-latency, internet-independent applications that can reliably run our business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;88d0&quot; id=&quot;88d0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;High availability for these applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;c53e&quot; id=&quot;c53e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Platform that enables rapid innovation and that allows delivery of business functionality to production as quickly as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;0bff&quot; id=&quot;0bff&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Horizontal scale — infrastructure and application development teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 name=&quot;b15d&quot; id=&quot;b15d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Capacity Pressures&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a8a2&quot; id=&quot;a8a2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Chick-fil-A is a very successful company in large part because of our fantastic food and &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2018/07/05/best-fast-food-restaurant-2018/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2018/07/05/best-fast-food-restaurant-2018/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;customer service&lt;/a&gt; — both the result of the great people that operate and work in our restaurants. They are unmatched in the industry. The result is &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; busy restaurants. If you have been to a Chick-fil-A restaurant, this is not news to you.

&lt;p name=&quot;9f72&quot; id=&quot;9f72&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;While we are very grateful for our successes, they have created a lot of capacity challenges for us as a business. To put it in perspective, we do more sales in &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;six&lt;/em&gt; days a week than our competitors do in &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;seven&lt;/em&gt; (we are closed on Sunday). Many of our restaurants are doing greater than &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;three times&lt;/strong&gt; the volume that they were initially designed for. These are great problems to have, but they create some extremely difficult challenges related to scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5be3&quot; id=&quot;5be3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;At Chick-fil-A, we believe the solutions to many of these capacity problems are &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;technology&lt;/em&gt; solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;230a&quot; id=&quot;230a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;A new generation of workloads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b864&quot; id=&quot;b864&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;One of our approaches to solving these problems is to invest in a smarter restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3f27&quot; id=&quot;3f27&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Our goal: simplify the restaurant experience for Owner/Operators and their teams and optimize for great, hot, tasty, food served quickly and with a personal touch, all while increasing the capacity of our existing footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;36d8&quot; id=&quot;36d8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Our hypothesis: By making smarter kitchen equipment we can collect more data. By applying data to our restaurant, we can build more intelligent systems. By building more intelligent systems, we can better scale our business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;83bf&quot; id=&quot;83bf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As a simple example, image a forecasting model that attempts to predict how many Waffle Fries (or replace with your favorite Chick-fil-A product) should be cooked over every minute of the day. The forecast is created by an analytics process running in the cloud that uses transaction-level sales data from many restaurants. This forecast can most certainly be produced with a little work. Unfortunately, it is not accurate enough to actually drive food production. Sales in Chick-fil-A restaurants are prone to many traffic spikes and are significantly affected by local events (traffic, sports, weather, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e927&quot; id=&quot;e927&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;However, if we were to collect data from our point-of-sale system’s keystrokes in real-time to understand current demand, add data from the fryers about work in progress inventory, and then micro-adjust the initial forecast in-restaurant, we would be able to get a much more accurate picture of what we should cook at any given moment. This data can then be used to give a much more intelligent display to a restaurant team member that is responsible for cooking fries (for example), or perhaps to drive cooking automation in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2bb8&quot; id=&quot;2bb8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Goals like this led us to develop an Internet of Things (IOT) platform for our restaurants. To successfully scale our business we need the ability to 1) collect data and 2) use it to drive automation in the restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3f19&quot; id=&quot;3f19&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Rather than select many different vendor solutions that were silo’d and disconnected and therefore difficult to integrate, we wanted an &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;open ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt; that we own. This approach enables us to allow internal developers and/or external partners to develop connected “things” or applications for the Edge and leverage our platform for common needs like security, identity, and connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5f5d&quot; id=&quot;5f5d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Put another way, the IOT/Edge team owns a small subset of the overall application base that is deployed on the edge, and is effectively a runtime platform team for the in-restaurant compute platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;f008&quot; id=&quot;f008&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Architecture Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f43b&quot; id=&quot;f43b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Here is a look at the architecture we developed (and are using today) to meet these goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*R6_1n9WyVBEORH2tNZhg_g.png&quot; data-width=&quot;2836&quot; data-height=&quot;1280&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*R6_1n9WyVBEORH2tNZhg_g.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*R6_1n9WyVBEORH2tNZhg_g.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Simple view of our current architecture, w/ K8s changes highlighted
&lt;h4 name=&quot;1d2c&quot; id=&quot;1d2c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Cloud Control Plane&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5f96&quot; id=&quot;5f96&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Today, we run our higher order control plane and core IoT services in the cloud. This includes services like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;b0fa&quot; id=&quot;b0fa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Authorization Server — device identity management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;7af1&quot; id=&quot;7af1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Data ingest / routing — collect data and send it where it needs to go&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;a627&quot; id=&quot;a627&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Operational time series data — logs, monitoring, alerting, tracing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;ea44&quot; id=&quot;ea44&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Deployment management — self-service deployment for our application teams using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weave.works/blog/gitops-operations-by-pull-request&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.weave.works/blog/gitops-operations-by-pull-request&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GitOps&lt;/a&gt; (kudos to our friends at Weaveworks for sharing the term). We plan to share our work and code soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;12c5&quot; id=&quot;12c5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;These services also run in Kubernetes so that we have a common paradigm across all of our team’s deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;678d&quot; id=&quot;678d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Edge&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5190&quot; id=&quot;5190&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;“Edge Computing” is the idea of &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;putting compute resources close to the action to attain a higher level of availability and/or lower level of latency.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2872&quot; id=&quot;2872&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We think of our Edge Computing environment as a “micro private cloud”. By this, we mean that we provide developers with a series of helpful services and a place to deploy their applications on our infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1e43&quot; id=&quot;1e43&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Does this make us the largest “cloud provider” in the world? You can be the judge of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*IDbfSWxAnROTOiJ5j-2hgg.png&quot; data-width=&quot;2690&quot; data-height=&quot;1300&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*IDbfSWxAnROTOiJ5j-2hgg.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*IDbfSWxAnROTOiJ5j-2hgg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bfa1&quot; id=&quot;bfa1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;In all seriousness, this approach gives us a unique kind of scale. Rather than a few large K8s clusters with &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;tens-to-hundreds-of-thousands&lt;/em&gt; of containers, at full scale we will have more than 2000 clusters with &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;tens of containers&lt;/em&gt; per cluster. And that number grows significantly as we open many new restaurants every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f1db&quot; id=&quot;f1db&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Our edge workloads include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;66ce&quot; id=&quot;66ce&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;platform services such as an authentication token service, pub/sub messaging (MQTT), log collection/exfiltration (&lt;a href=&quot;https://fluentbit.io/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://fluentbit.io/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FluentBit&lt;/a&gt;), monitoring (&lt;a href=&quot;https://prometheus.io/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://prometheus.io/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt;), etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;00c3&quot; id=&quot;00c3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;applications that interact with “things” in the restaurant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;d29d&quot; id=&quot;d29d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;simple microservices that serve HTTP requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;42a2&quot; id=&quot;42a2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;machine learning models that synthesize cloud-developed forecasts with real-time events from MQTT to make decisions at the edge and drive automation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;436b&quot; id=&quot;436b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Our physical edge environment obtains it’s connectivity from multiple in-restaurant switches (and two routers), so we operate on a very highly available LAN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;87bc&quot; id=&quot;87bc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Today, nearly all of the data that is collected at the Edge is ephemeral and only needs to exist for a short time before being exfiltrated to the cloud. This could change in the future, but it has kept our early-stage deployments very simple and made them much easier to manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0139&quot; id=&quot;0139&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Since we have a highly available Kubernetes cluster with data replicated across all nodes, we can ensure that we can retain any data that is collected until a time when the internet is again available for data exfiltration. We can also aggregate, compress, or drop data dynamically at the Edge based on business need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;44a1&quot; id=&quot;44a1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Given all of this, we still use the &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;cloud&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;first&lt;/strong&gt; for our services whenever possible. Edge is the fallback deployment target when high-availability, low-latency, in-restaurant applications are a must.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;f925&quot; id=&quot;f925&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Following in the footsteps of giants&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1fd1&quot; id=&quot;1fd1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;We run our Edge infrastructure on commodity hardware that costs us, &lt;a href=&quot;https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/28310/origin-of-ballpark-estimate-to-mean-a-very-rough-estimate&quot; data-href=&quot;https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/28310/origin-of-ballpark-estimate-to-mean-a-very-rough-estimate&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;ballpark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; $1000/restaurant. We wanted to keep our hardware investment low-cost and horizontally scalable. We have not found a way to make it dynamic/elastic yet, but maybe one day (order on Amazon w/ free 30-second shipping perhaps?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2964&quot; id=&quot;2964&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;With our architecture, we can add additional compute capacity as-needed by adding additional devices. We may upsize our hardware footprint in the future, but what we have makes sense for our workloads today. Google also got started scaling workloads on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcworld.com/article/112891/article.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.pcworld.com/article/112891/article.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;commodity hardware&lt;/a&gt; (written in 2003, where has the time gone?)… so we’re in good company!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5788&quot; id=&quot;5788&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We hope our approach to Edge infrastructure encourages creative thinking for anyone that is working with scarce resources (physical space, budget, or otherwise). I think that’s &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;614b&quot; id=&quot;614b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Everything else&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6134&quot; id=&quot;6134&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Finally, we have our connectivity layer and the IOT things. Many of our devices are fully-powered (no batteries) but still constrained on chipsets/processing power. Wi-Fi is the default method for connectivity. We have not committed to a low-power protocol yet, but are interested in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LoRa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11ah&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11ah&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WiFi Halo (802.11ah)&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bba8&quot; id=&quot;bba8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For things/physical devices, our team also provides developers with an SDK for executing on-boarding flows (all OAuth based) and for accessing services within the Edge environment such as MQTT. Brian talked about this more extensively at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infoq.com/presentations/chickfila-iot&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.infoq.com/presentations/chickfila-iot&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;QConNY 2017&lt;/a&gt; (note that we were using Docker Swarm vs. Kubernetes at the time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;3060&quot; id=&quot;3060&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Containers at the Edge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;80ac&quot; id=&quot;80ac&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Why would you want to run containers at the Edge? For the same reason you would run them in the cloud (or anywhere else).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1a21&quot; id=&quot;1a21&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Dependency management becomes easier. Testing is easier. The developer experience is easier and better. Teams can move much faster and more autonomously, especially when reasonable points of abstraction (such as k8s namespaces) and resource limits (CPU/RAM) are applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f1ef&quot; id=&quot;f1ef&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Another key design goal was reliability for our critical applications, meaning no single points-of-failure in the architecture. There are many ways this type of goal can be achieved, but we decided having &amp;gt; 1 physical hosts at the Edge and a container-based orchestration layer was the best approach for the types of workloads we have and for the skillset of our teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bf35&quot; id=&quot;bf35&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We initially called our strategy “Redundant Restaurant Compute”, which really speaks to the goal behind our approach. Later, we transitioned to calling it “Edge Computing”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;dbb8&quot; id=&quot;dbb8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The ability to orchestrate services effectively and to preserve a desired number of replicas quickly and consistently attracted us to Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;3b59&quot; id=&quot;3b59&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Why Kubernetes?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5d6f&quot; id=&quot;5d6f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;At first, we planned to use Docker Swarm for container orchestration, but made the move to Kubernetes in early 2018 because we believe it’s core capabilities and surrounding ecosystem are (by far) the strongest. We are excited about taking advantage of some of the developments around Kubernetes like &lt;a href=&quot;https://istio.io/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://istio.io/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Istio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openfaas/faas&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/openfaas/faas&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OpenFaaS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c6e3&quot; id=&quot;c6e3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Most importantly, we firmly believe…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8c4f&quot; id=&quot;8c4f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Ideas, in and of themselves, have no value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;dc59&quot; id=&quot;dc59&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Code, in and of itself, has no value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9e9f&quot; id=&quot;9e9f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The only thing that has value is code &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;that is running in production&lt;/em&gt;. Only then have you created value for users and had the opportunity to impact your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*Q68UZ5maIWMdAAGW_Tyrgw.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1464&quot; data-height=&quot;658&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*Q68UZ5maIWMdAAGW_Tyrgw.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*Q68UZ5maIWMdAAGW_Tyrgw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ec82&quot; id=&quot;ec82&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Therefore, at Chick-fil-A, we want to optimize for taking great ideas, turning them into code, and getting that code running in production &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;as fast as possible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2337&quot; id=&quot;2337&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations-ebook/dp/B07B9F83WM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1531455879&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=accelerate&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations-ebook/dp/B07B9F83WM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1531455879&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=accelerate&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; says that using the latest and greatest technology (like Kubernetes) has no correlation to a team or organization’s success. None. The ability to turn ideas into code and get code into production rapidly does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b559&quot; id=&quot;b559&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If you can accomplish this goal and meet your requirements with VMWare, a single machine, some other clustering tool or orchestration layer, or using just the cloud, we would not try and convince you to switch to Kubernetes and follow our lead. The simplest possible solution is &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; the best solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7e56&quot; id=&quot;7e56&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;At Chick-fil-A, we believe that the best way for &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;us&lt;/strong&gt; to achieve these goals is for us to embrace containerization, and to do so with Kubernetes. At the end of the day, its all there to help you “Eat More Chicken”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;743b&quot; id=&quot;743b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Next&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8233&quot; id=&quot;8233&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;What are our next steps?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;596a&quot; id=&quot;596a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In the next 18-24 months, we expect to increase the number of smart/connected devices in our restaurants to &amp;gt; 100,000 and complete our chain-wide rollout of Kubernetes to the Edge. The number of use cases for “brain applications” that control the restaurant from the edge continue to grow, and we look forward to serving them and sharing more with the community about what we learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c7ee&quot; id=&quot;c7ee&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We will also take a close look at the Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/gke-on-prem/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/gke-on-prem/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GKE On-Prem&lt;/a&gt; service that was just announced since it might save us from building and managing clusters in the future. What we have done to-date is a sunk cost, and if we can re-focus resources on the differentiating rather than infrastructure, you can be certain we will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;555d&quot; id=&quot;555d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;If we failed to answer questions you have about what we’re doing, don’t hesitate to reach out on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-chambers/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-chambers/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;. If we can help you with any challenges with Kubernetes at the Edge, please let us know. At Chick-fil-A, it is always our please to share, and (kudos to Caleb for this) “our pleasure to server you”.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Redis will remain BSD licensed</title>
<link>http://antirez.com/news/120</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://antirez.com/news/120</guid>
<description>&lt;section id=&quot;newslist&quot;&gt;&lt;article data-news-id=&quot;120&quot;&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;article class=&quot;comment&quot; data-comment-id=&quot;120-&quot; id=&quot;120-&quot; readability=&quot;9.9731492136555&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;info&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;username&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://antirez.com/user/antirez&quot;&gt;antirez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 10 hours ago. 31604 views.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Today a page about the new Common Clause license in the Redis Labs web site was interpreted as if Redis itself switched license. This is not the case, Redis is, and will remain, BSD licensed. However in the era of [edit] uncontrollable spreading of information, my attempts to provide the correct information failed, and I’m still seeing everywhere “Redis is no longer open source”. The reality is that Redis remains BSD, and actually Redis Labs did the right thing supporting my effort to keep the Redis core open as usually.

What is happening instead is that certain Redis modules, developed inside Redis Labs, are now released under the Common Clause (using Apache license as a base license). This means that basically certain enterprise add-ons, instead of being completely closed source as they could be, will be available with a more permissive license.

I think that Redis Labs Common Clause page did not provide a clear and complete information, but software companies often make communication errors, it happens. To me however, it looks more important that while running a system software business in the “cloud era” (LOL) is very challenging using an open source license, yet Redis Labs totally understood and supported the idea that the Redis core is an open source project, in the *most permissive license ever*, that is, BSD, and during the years provided a lot of funding to the project.

The reason why certain modules developed internally at Redis Labs are switching license, is because they are added value that Redis Labs wants to be able to provide only to end users that are willing to compile and install the system themselves, or to the Redis Labs customers using their services. But it’s not ok to give away that value to everybody willing to resell it. An example of such module is RediSearch: it was AGPL and is now going to be Apache + Common Clause.

About myself, I’ll keep writing BSD code for Redis. For Redis modules I’ll develop, such as Disque, I’ll pick AGPL instead, for similar reasons: we live in a “Cloud-poly”, so it’s a good idea to go forward with licenses that will force other SaaS companies to redistribute back their improvements. However this does not apply to Redis itself. Redis at this point is a 10 years collective effort, the base for many other things that we can do together, and this base must be as available as possible, that is, BSD licensed.

We at Redis Labs are sorry for the confusion generated by the Creative Common page, and my colleagues are working to fix the page with better wording.

<title>The Commons Clause is an existential threat to open source</title>
<link>https://drewdevault.com/2018/08/22/Commons-clause-will-destroy-open-source.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://drewdevault.com/2018/08/22/Commons-clause-will-destroy-open-source.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;An alarmist title, I know, but it’s true. If the &lt;a href=&quot;https://commonsclause.com/&quot;&gt;Commons clause&lt;/a&gt; were to be adopted by all open source projects, they would cease to be open source&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;/&gt;, and therefore the Commons clause is trying to destroy open source. When this first appeared I spoke out about it in discussion threads around the net, but didn’t think anyone would take it seriously. Well, yesterday, some parts of Redis &lt;a href=&quot;https://redislabs.com/community/commons-clause/&quot;&gt;became proprietary software&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commons Clause promoted by Kevin Wang presents one of the greatest existential threats to open source I’ve ever seen. It preys on a vulnerability open source maintainers all suffer from, and one I can strongly relate to. It &lt;em&gt;sucks&lt;/em&gt; to not be able to make money from your open source work. It &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; sucks when companies are using your work to make money for themselves. If a solution presents itself, it’s tempting to jump at it. But the Commons Clause doesn’t present a solution for supporting open source software. It presents a framework for turning open source software into proprietary software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What should we do about open source maintainers not getting the funding they need? It’s a very real problem, and one Kevin has &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kevinverse/status/1032074268291424257&quot;&gt;explicitly asked us&lt;/a&gt; to talk about before we criticise his solution to it. I would be happy to share my thoughts. I’ve struggled for many years to find a way to finance myself as the maintainer of many dozens of projects. For a long time it has been a demotivating struggle with no clear solutions, a struggle which at one point probably left me vulnerable to the temptations offered by the Common Clause. But today, the situation is clearly improving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I have a harder go of it because very little of my open source software is appealing to the businesses that have the budget to sponsor them. Instead, I rely on the (much smaller and less stable) recurring donations of my individual users. When I started accepting these, I did not think that it was going to work out. But today, I’m making far more money from these donations than I ever thought possible&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;/&gt;, and I see an upwards trend which will eventually lead me to being able to work on open source full time. If I were able to add only a few business-level sponsorships to this equation, I think I would easily have already reached my goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other options for securing financing for open source, some of which Redis has already been exploring. Selling a hosted and supported version of your service is often a good call. Offering consulting support for your software has also worked for many groups in the past. Some projects succeed with (A)GPL for everyone and BSD for a price. These are all better avenues to explore - making your software proprietary is a tragic alternative that should not be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to combine these methods with a greater appreciation for open source in the business community. Businesses need engineers - appeal to your peers so they can appeal to the money on behalf of the projects they depend on. A $250/mo recurring donation to would be a drop in the bucket of most businesses, but a major boon to any open source project, with which the business will almost certainly see tangible value-add as a result. When I get to work today I’m going to identify open source projects we use that accept donations and make the plea&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;/&gt;, and keep making the plea week over week until money is spent. You should, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redis also stands out as a cautionary entry in the history of Contributor License Agreements. Everyone who has contributed to the now-proprietary Redis modules has had their hard work stolen and sold by RedisLabs under a proprietary license. I do not sign CLAs and I think they’re a harmful practice for this very reason. Asking a contributor to sign them is a slap in the face to the good will which led them to make a contribution in the first place. Don’t sign these and don’t ask others to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I respect antirez&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;/&gt; very much, but I am sorely disappointed in him. He should have known better and, if you’re reading this, I urge you to roll back your misguided decision. But the Commons Clause is much more deeply disturbing. What Kevin is doing will ruin open source software, maybe for good&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really appreciate some of Kevin’s work. &lt;a href=&quot;https://fossa.io/&quot;&gt;FOSSA&lt;/a&gt; is a really cool tool that can stand to provide some serious value to the open source community. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tldrlegal.com/&quot;&gt;TL;DR Legal&lt;/a&gt; is a fantastic tool which has already delivered a tremendous amount of value to open source, and I’ve personally referenced it dozens of times. Thank you, honestly, for your work on improving the legal landscape of open source. With Commons Clause, however, Kevin has taken it too far. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html&quot;&gt;The four freedoms&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;em&gt;important&lt;/em&gt;. The only solution is to bury the Common Clause project. Kill the website and GitHub repository, and we can try to forget this ever happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand that turning back is going to be hard, which scares me. I know that Kevin has already put a lot of effort into it and convinced himself that it’s the Right Thing To Do. It takes work to write the clause, vet it for legal issues, design a website (a beautiful one, I’ll give you that), and to promote it among your target audience. I know how hard it is to distance yourself from something you’ve staked your personal reputation on. You had only the best intentions&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot;/&gt;, Kevin, but please step back from the ego and do the right thing - take this down. You stand to undo all of your hard work for the open source community in one fell swoop with this initiative. I’m begging you, stop while it’s not too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man, two angry articles in a row. I have more technical articles coming up, I promise.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>The Commons Clause will destroy open source</og:title>
<og:description>An alarmist title, I know, but it’s true. If the Commons clause were to be adopted by all open source projects, they would cease to be open source1, and therefore the Commons clause is trying to destroy open source. When this first appeared I spoke out about it in discussion threads around the net, but didn’t think anyone would take it seriously. Well, yesterday, some parts of Redis became proprietary software. Under both the OSI and FSF definitions. The Commons Clause removes freedom 0 of the four essential freedoms. ↩</og:description>

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;# What do numbers look like? ![One million integers embedded into 2D space with UMAP](primes_umap_1e6_contrast_enhanced.png) This is the first million integers, represented as binary vectors indicating their prime factors, and laid out using the [UMAP dimensionality reduction algorithm](https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap) by Leland Mcinnes. Each integer is represented in a high-dimensional space, and gets squished down to 2D so that numbers with similar prime factorisations are closer together than those with dissimilar factorisations. A very pretty structure emerges; this might be spurious in that it captures more about the layout algorithm than any *&quot;true&quot;* structure of numbers. However, the visual effect is very appealling and requires no tricky manipulation to create. [Large 4k version of the image suitable for backgrounds](primes_umap_1e6_4k.png) ## Video A short video, showing the numbers being added in sequence. Each frame adds 1000 integers, for a total of 1000 frames. &lt;iframe width=&quot;726&quot; height=&quot;408&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nCk8dyU7zUM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt; ## Representation Each integer is represented as a vector, one element for each possible prime factor, where 0=prime factor not present, 1=prime factor present. This provides a simple geometry for the integers, where each number can be seen as being composed of prime basis vectors. For example, 10 might be represented as `[1 0 1 0 0 0 0 ...]` as it has factors 2 and 5 (the first and third primes respectively). These high-dimensional vectors are then squashed down from thousands of dimensions for each number to just two dimensions, and a point plotted at that coordinate. The points are coloured according to the original integer index; brighter colours correspond to larger numbers. The points are laid out so that numbers with similar &quot;angles&quot; to each other are close together. For example, all primes are at 90 degrees to each other, and all powers of a number are identical to each other (0 degree angle). ### Algorithm * for each `i` up to `n` * find prime factors of `i`. * For each `i`, make binary vector with [`π(n)`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime-counting_function) columns (π(n) = number of primes less than `n`), where each element has `1`=prime factor present, `0`=absent. * Stack all vectors into a large, sparse matrix * Lay out with UMAP, using the cosine distance function (dot product). I used [`li(n)`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_integral_function) as a cheap upper bound on `π(n)` to estimate the number of columns needed. For example, for `n=11`, the matrix looks like: ``` 2 3 5 7 11 [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.] 0 [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.] 1 [1. 0. 0. 0. 0.] 2 [0. 1. 0. 0. 0.] 3 [1. 0. 0. 0. 0.] 4 [0. 0. 1. 0. 0.] 5 [1. 1. 0. 0. 0.] 6 [0. 0. 0. 1. 0.] 7 [1. 0. 0. 0. 0.] 8 [0. 1. 0. 0. 0.] 9 [1. 0. 1. 0. 0.] 10 [0. 0. 0. 0. 1.] 11 ``` The image above is reduced from a 1000000x78628 (!) binary matrix to 1000000x2. This only works because of the excellent sparse matrix support in UMAP. ### What are we seeing? The points can be filtered according to whatever criteria we might be interested in. For example, the parity of the numbers (even=green, odd=orange) ![Coloured by parity of the points](primes_even_odd_4k_crop.png) or alternatively by the whether the points are prime or not (white=prime, blue=composite). ![Coloured by primeness of the points](is_prime_1k.png) As might be expected, the primes form the vague, diffuse cluster near the centre, as they are all orthogonal to each other. Extending this idea, we can colour the points by number of unique factors: ![Coloured by number of unique factors](primes_colored_1k.png) We can colour the points according to the prime factors they contain, where the log of the factor is mapped to hue, with redder=smaller, bluer=larger factor. This generalises the parity plot above. This plot has just a touch of spatial noise added to try and separate out the colours more clearly, as each factor pass is rendered as a separate layer. ![Coloured by factors present, hue mapped to prime factor](primes_mod_multispectral_4k_crop.png) #### Sequences We can look at where common sequences of numbers lie. This isn't particularly informative, but there is perhaps some pattern. For example, the Fibonacci sequence: ![Fibonacci sequence numbers marked in yellow](primes_A000045.png) or the squares: ![Squares marked in yellow](primes_A000290.png) #### The frontier It's worth noting that any structure that is not an algorithmic artificat is really the **frontier** of numbers at some threshold (in this case, 1 million). *Every* possible finite binary vector corresponds to at least one integer in this representation (actually, infinitely many, as all repeated factors are contracted onto a single binary indicator). Therefore, in the infinite set of integers, all points are present, at every possible angle or distance from each other, and the space would be perfectly evenly filled. However, by cutting off at some specific `n`, we see the &quot;surface&quot; that we have reached by composing together primes such that their product is less than `n`. ### Code The [python code is available](https://gist.github.com/johnhw/dfc7b8b8519aac530ac97da226c17bd5).

<title>Bullshit jobs and the yoke of managerial feudalism</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not since Dilbert has truth been spoken to power in soulless work settings. But the cartoon character’s successor may be David Graeber. In 2013 he achieved viral fame with cubicle zombies everywhere after he published a short essay on the prevalence of work that had no social or economic reason to exist, which he called “bullshit jobs”. The wide attention seemed to confirm his thesis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mr Graeber, an anthropologist at the London School of Economics, has expanded on the ideas in a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Bullshit-Jobs-Theory-David-Graeber/dp/150114331X&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;. He responded to five questions from&lt;/em&gt; The Economist’s &lt;em&gt;Open Future initiative. He rails against “feudal retinues of basically useless flunkies.” As he puts it: “People want to feel they are transforming the world around them in a way that makes some kind a positive difference.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*  *  *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Economist:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;What is a “bullshit job” and can you give a few examples? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Graeber:&lt;/strong&gt; A bullshit job is one that even the person doing it secretly believes need not, or should not, exist. That if the job, or even the whole industry, were to vanish, either it would make no difference to anyone, or the world might even be a slightly better place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something like 37-40% of workers according to surveys say their jobs make no difference. Insofar as there’s anything really radical about the book, it’s not to observe that many people feel that way, but simply to say we should proceed on the assumption that for the most part, people’s self-assessments are largely correct. Their jobs really are just as pointless as they think they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anything, just taking people’s word for it might understate the problem, since if you think that what you’re doing is pointless, but there’s some non-obvious larger big-picture way that you’re really contributing to the greater good, at least the greater good of the organisation, then what’s the chance no one is going to tell you that? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;component-image blog-post__image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2018/06/blogs/open-future/20180623_blp520.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;component-image__img blog-post-article-image blog-post-article-image__slim&quot; srcset=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/images/2018/06/blogs/open-future/20180623_blp520.jpg 200w, /sites/default/files/imagecache/300-width/images/2018/06/blogs/open-future/20180623_blp520.jpg 300w, /sites/default/files/imagecache/400-width/images/2018/06/blogs/open-future/20180623_blp520.jpg 400w, /sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/2018/06/blogs/open-future/20180623_blp520.jpg 640w, /sites/default/files/imagecache/800-width/images/2018/06/blogs/open-future/20180623_blp520.jpg 800w, /sites/default/files/imagecache/1000-width/images/2018/06/blogs/open-future/20180623_blp520.jpg 1000w, /sites/default/files/imagecache/1200-width/images/2018/06/blogs/open-future/20180623_blp520.jpg 1200w, /sites/default/files/imagecache/1280-width/images/2018/06/blogs/open-future/20180623_blp520.jpg 1280w, /sites/default/files/imagecache/1600-width/images/2018/06/blogs/open-future/20180623_blp520.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 600px) 640px, calc(100vw - 20px)&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you think you’re doing something that seems like there’s a good reason to be doing it, but in the larger big-picture you’re not (say, the whole operation that you're working for is actually some kind of scam, or no one is really reading your reports, etc), well, that’s precisely the situation where they’re least likely to tell you what’s really going on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bullshit job is one that even the person doing it secretly believes need not, or should not, exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If my own research is anything to go by, bullshit jobs concentrate not so much in services as in clerical, administrative, managerial, and supervisory roles. A lot of workers in middle management, PR, human resources, a lot of brand managers, creative vice presidents, financial consultants, compliance workers, feel their jobs are pointless, but also a lot of people in fields like corporate law or telemarketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Economist:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;What does it say about the modern workplace that these purposeless jobs exist? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr Graeber:&lt;/strong&gt; One thing it shows is that the whole “lean and mean” ideal is applied much more to productive workers than to office cubicles. It’s not at all uncommon for the same executives who pride themselves on downsizing and speed-ups on the shop floor, or in delivery and so forth, to use the money saved at least in part to fill their offices with feudal retinues of basically useless flunkies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have whole teams of people who are just there, for instance, to design the graphics for their reports, write accolades for in-house magazines no one reads, or in many cases, who aren’t really doing anything at all, just making cat memes all day or playing computer games. But they are kept on because the prestige and even sometimes the salary of any given manager is measured by how many people he has working under him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executives who pride themselves on downsizing use the money saved to fill their offices with feudal retinues of useless flunkies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more a company’s profits are derived from finance rather than from actually making and selling anything, the more this tends to be true. I call it “managerial feudalism.” But it’s not just the FIRE  [financial, insurance and real estate] sector: you have a similar infestation of intermediary ranks in the creative industries as well. They keep adding new managerial positions in between the people producing stuff and the guys ultimately paying for it, often whose only role is to sit around all day trying to sell things to each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health and education are equally hard hit: managers now feel they need to each have their little squadron of assistants, who often have nothing to do, so they end up making up new exotic forms of paperwork for the teachers, doctors, nurses… who thus have ever less time to actually teach or treat or care for anyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Economist:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;You note that a lot of interesting jobs that entail creativity and status are concentrated in affluent cities. Do you think bullshit jobs have contributed to populism and polarisation? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr Graeber:&lt;/strong&gt; I do. I think a lot of the—often quite legitimate—rancor directed at the “liberal elite” is based on resentment of those working-class people see as having effectively grabbed all the jobs where you’ll actually get paid well to do something that’s both fun and creative, but also, obviously benefits society. If you can’t afford to send your kid to a top college and then support them for 2-3 years doing unpaid internships in some place like New York or San Francisco, forget it, you’re locked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an almost perfect inverse relation between how much your work directly benefits others and remuneration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For everybody else, unless you get very lucky, your choices are largely limited to two options. You can get a basically bullshit job, which will pay the rent but leave you wracked with the guilty feeling that you are being forced, against your will, to be a fraud and a parasite. Or, you can get a helpful, useful job taking care of people, making or moving or maintaining things that people want or need - but then, likely you will be paid so little you won’t be able to take care of your own family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an almost perfect inverse relation between how much your work directly benefits others, and remuneration. The result is a toxic political culture of resentment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those in the largely pointless jobs secretly resent teachers or even auto workers, who actually get to do something useful, and feel it’s outrageous when they demand nice salaries and health care and paid vacations too. Working class people who get to do mostly useful things, resent the liberal elite who grabbed all the useful or beneficial work which actually does pay well and treats you with dignity and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone hates the political class who they see (in my opinion, quite rightly) as basically a bunch of crooks. But all the other resentments make it very difficult for anyone to get together to do anything about it. To a large extent, our societies have come to be held together by envy and resentment: not envy of the rich, but in many cases, envy of those who are seen as in some ways morally superior, or resentment of those who claim moral superiority but who are seen as hypocritical. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Economist: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People tend to emotionally adjust to their circumstances, so is there any reason to believe that we would be dramatically more satisfied in a world free from drudgery? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr Graeber:&lt;/strong&gt; The thing that surprised me was just how hard it was for so many people to adjust to what seemed like comparatively minor problems: basically, boredom and sense of purposelessness in life. Why couldn’t they just say, “Okay, so I’m getting something for nothing. Let’s just hope the boss doesn’t figure it out!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the overwhelming majority reported themselves to be utterly miserable. They reported depression, anxiety, psychosomatic illnesses that would magically disappear the moment they were given what they considered real work; awful sadomasochistic workplace dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My own conclusion was that psychologically, it’s not exactly that people want to work, it’s more that people want to feel they are transforming the world around them in a way that makes some kind a positive difference to other people. In a way, that’s what being human is all about. Take it away from them, they start to fall apart. So it’s not exactly drudgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Dostoevsky said somewhere: if you want to totally destroy a prisoner psychologically, just make them dig a hole and fill it in again, over and over, all day long - and in some gulags, they actually tried that out as a form of torture and he was right, it worked. It drove people completely crazy. I think people can put up with even boring work if they know there’s a good reason to be doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not that people want to work; it’s that people want to feel they are transforming the world in a way that makes a positive difference&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an anthropologist, I know that leisure isn’t itself a problem. There’s plenty of societies where people work two-to-three hours a day maximum, and they find all sorts of interesting things to do with their time. People can be endlessly creative if you give them time to think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Economist:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;People in the West have more freedom to choose their careers than at any time in human history. Does liberalism deserve some credit for that and if so, are people not responsible for their own bullshit jobs? &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr Graeber:&lt;/strong&gt; Well if you talk to young people fresh out of college, you don’t hear a lot of them saying, “Ah, the world lies open before me … what then would I best do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, you heard that a lot in the 1970s, 80s, even 90s: “What do I really want?” Now, not so much. Most graduates are in a panic over how they’re going to pay their student loans and the real dilemma you hear is: “Can I get a job that will actually pay me enough to live on (let alone be able to have a family someday) that I wouldn’t be entirely ashamed of?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the same trap I described above: how can you live a life that benefits others, or at least doesn’t hurt anyone in any obvious way, and still be able to take care of a family or the people that you love. And all the while there’s this endless drumbeat of what I call “rights-scolding,” and it comes from the left and right equally. It’s a moral invective towards young people as entitled and spoiled for expecting they deserve any of the things that their parents’ generation (who are usually the ones doing the scolding) took entirely for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I wouldn’t blame anyone for making the best they can of the situation. The question for me is: why isn’t this situation seen as a major social problem? I mean, if you count all the people who are in real work in support of bullshit jobs, all the cleaners or receptionists or drivers who don’t know that the company they’re working for is basically a tax dodge or somesuch, and the bullshitisation of real work, then maybe half of the work that’s being done is totally unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question for me is: why isn’t this situation seen as a major social problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just think what kind of culture, music, science, ideas might result if all those people were liberated to do things they actually thought were important. So if the question is one of personal responsibility, I’d say: let’s just give everyone enough to live on, some sort of universal basic income, and say “okay, you’re all free now to decide for yourselves what you have to contribute to the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, sure, we could say that people would be responsible for what they came up with. And sure, a lot of it would be nonsense. But it’s hard to imagine a full 40-50% would be doing nonsense, and that’s the situation that we have today. And if we get even one or two new Miles Davises or Einsteins or Freuds or Shakespeares out of the deal, I’d say we’d have more than made back our investment. &lt;/p&gt;

<title>Valve Rolls Out Wine-Based “Proton” for Running Windows Games on Linux</title>
<link>https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Valve-Steam-Play-Proton-Linux</link>

<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;VALVE -- &quot; src=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/valve.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;100&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Valve has today announced a new version of Steam Play that allows Linux gamers to enjoy Windows games on Linux via their new Wine-based Proton project.&lt;p&gt;Here's the key elements of today's announcement:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Windows games with no Linux version currently available can now be installed and run directly from the Linux Steam client, complete with native Steamworks and OpenVR support.&lt;br/&gt;- DirectX 11 and 12 implementations are now based on Vulkan, resulting in improved game compatibility and reduced performance impact.&lt;br/&gt;- Fullscreen support has been improved: fullscreen games will be seamlessly stretched to the desired display without interfering with the native monitor resolution or requiring the use of a virtual desktop.&lt;br/&gt;- Improved game controller support: games will automatically recognize all controllers supported by Steam. Expect more out-of-the-box controller compatibility than even the original version of the game.&lt;br/&gt;- Performance for multi-threaded games has been greatly improved compared to vanilla Wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It's interesting to hear they have some performance improvements in their &quot;Proton&quot; Wine code-base and it will be interesting to see what they try to upstream in Wine.&lt;p&gt;Proton is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/&quot;&gt;open-source on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. The source repository does confirm that DXVK is being used for the Direct3D on Vulkan support and that they have been employing its developer, among other recent engagements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Windows games they are supporting today with the new Steam Play beta are QUAKE, Tropico 4, Star Wars: Battlefront 2, DOOM, DOOM VFR, PAYDAY: The Heist, STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl, and several others. They will be adding more Windows games as they finish testing them and ensuring good support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the details can be found via this just-posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/games/221410/announcements/detail/1696055855739350561&quot;&gt;Steam announcement&lt;/a&gt;. I'll be checking it out to see if it makes for any interesting benchmark comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Commons Clause</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://redislabs.com/community/commons-clause/</guid>
<description>&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is Redis Licensed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://redis.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Redis&lt;/a&gt; is open source, BSD license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://redislabs.com/community/redis-modules-hub/&quot;&gt;Redis Modules,&lt;/a&gt; which are add-ons on top of Redis, are created by people in the community and bear different licenses (such as BSD and MIT), according to creator’s choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain modules created by Redis Labs (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://oss.redislabs.com/redisearch/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;RediSearch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://oss.redislabs.com/redisgraph/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Redis Graph&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://oss.redislabs.com/rejson/&quot;&gt;ReJSON&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://oss.redislabs.com/redisml/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Redis-ML&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://oss.redislabs.com/rebloom/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Rebloom&lt;/a&gt;) are licensed Apache 2.0 modified with &lt;a href=&quot;http://commonsclause.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Commons Clause&lt;/a&gt;. See further explanation below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://redislabs.com/redis-enterprise/&quot;&gt;Redis Enterprise&lt;/a&gt; is closed source by Redis Labs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Commons Clause&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Initiated by a coalition of top infrastructure software companies to protect their rights, Commons Clause is a condition added to existing &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org/licenses&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;open source software licenses&lt;/a&gt; to create a new, combined software license. The combined license maintains all conditions of the underlying open source license, but limits commercial sale of the software. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://commonsclause.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;commonsclause.com&lt;/a&gt;, its exact definition is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Software is provided to you by the Licensor under the License, as defined below, subject to the following condition. Without limiting other conditions in the License, the grant of rights under the License will not include, and the License does not grant to you, the right to Sell the Software. For purposes of the foregoing, “Sell” means practicing any or all of the rights granted to you under the License to provide to third parties, for a fee or other consideration (including without limitation fees for hosting or consulting/ support services related to the Software), a product or service whose value derives, entirely or substantially, from the functionality of the Software. Any license notice or attribution required by the License must also include this Commons Cause License Condition notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Software: [name software]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;License: [Apache 2.0]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Licensor: [ABC company]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Why did Redis Labs adopt it?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Modern open source infrastructure software has created more value over the past decade than we could have ever imagined. Databases, orchestrators, distributed systems and other software technologies now power nearly every business on the planet; all thanks to the shared, collaborative philosophy of the open source community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;However, today’s cloud providers have repeatedly violated this ethos by taking advantage of successful open source projects and repackaging them into competitive, proprietary service offerings. Cloud providers contribute very little (if anything) to those open source projects. Instead, they use their monopolistic nature to derive hundreds of millions dollars in revenues from them. Already, this behavior has damaged open source communities and put some of the companies that support them out of business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://redis.io/&quot;&gt;Redis&lt;/a&gt; is an example of this paradigm. Today, most cloud providers offer Redis as a managed service over their infrastructure and enjoy huge income from software that was not developed by them. Redis Labs is leading and financing the development of open source Redis and deserves to enjoy the fruits of these efforts. Redis is and will always remain open source BSD license, but we decided to prevent cloud providers from creating managed services from certain add-ons on top of Redis (e.g. RediSearch, Redis Graph, ReJSON, Redis-ML, Rebloom). These are licensed Apache 2.0 modified with Commons Clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related links:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;How does the Commons Clause restriction affect me?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We’re committed to keeping Redis open, so companies (big and small) can use this incredible technology and freely integrate it with their proprietary solutions. The Redis core is, and always will remain, an open source BSD license. Certain add-ons on top of Redis (modules), however, are now licensed as “Apache 2.0 modified with Commons Clause.” These modules can be freely used in any application, but selling a product whose value derives, entirely or substantially, from their functionality is prohibited. In simple words: if your product is an application that uses such a module to perform select functions, you can use it freely and there are no restrictions on selling your product. However, if what you sell is basically the functionality of the module packaged as a cloud service or on-prem software, Commons Clause does not allow it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Is Commons Clause open source?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Open Source Initiative (OSI)&lt;/a&gt;, open source licensing cannot limit the scope of a license – it only applies conditions to exercising it. With this model, no one can stop you from doing whatever you want with the software, whether commercial or non-commercial, or (famously) good or evil. Therefore, the no-sale restriction imposed by Commons Clause means that any software under this new license is non-open source by definition. However, in practice, Commons Clause only adds a limitation concerning fair use, and we believe that both licensing approaches share the same core value of making software available for use by anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;How do I contribute to Redis repositories under Commons Clause?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redis Labs’ open source projects are listed &lt;a href=&quot;https://redislabs.com/community/oss-projects/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Anyone can contribute to any of these projects (including those licensed with Commons Clause), provided he/she signs our &lt;a href=&quot;https://redislabs.com/company/legal-contributor-agreement/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Contributor License Agreement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

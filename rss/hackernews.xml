&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I've found that creating around other people has a ton of benefits both personally and professionally, and so I create those spaces for people via video chat. &lt;a href=&quot;https://unrealcollective.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://unrealcollective.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;12.904270986745&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Personally, whenever I feel lonely I would go volunteer and help people. It makes you feel connected and really puts things into perspective (like, even if your startup doesn't do well, you would still be surrounded by people who enjoys you as a person).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Every Saturday, my wife and I volunteer at our local library (northside branch in santa clara) to teach people how to code.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;We've been doing that for almost a year with surprising results. Now I'm leading about 10 engineers that I've taught from the ground up and they are happily building features for my app for minimum wage (temporarily). I'm hoping that one of my apps take off and I can pay everyone great salary. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;athing comtr&quot; id=&quot;15733600&quot; readability=&quot;11.661744966443&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Story went like that: I'm a gold miner. Gold mining is cool, everybody wants to gold mine. So I'll teach you FOR FREE how to gold mine, but during first year I offer you to gold mine for me at minimum wage. It's a shity goldmining you're doing, as you're newbie, so that excuses minimum wage, right? And I'm doing teaching for &quot;free&quot;, right? There were hundreds I trained to goldmine and they didnt accept my WORK (sacred word) offer. They didnt also goldmine afterwards. I call it free service and in addition for my goldmining minions get 'feeling good' from it. Others call it sieve just to find enough 'wanna be gold miner' newbies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;7.8705501618123&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;If the only way to get a non-shit gold mining job is to have a few months experience in a 'real' gold mine, then the minimum wage job is well worth doing.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I started back in uni doing software dev for McDonald's wages. By the time I graduated I had two years' experience which got me my first 'real' job. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;default&quot;&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Plenty of people pay lots of money to learn how to code. If someone is being paid to learn and work, isn’t that a pretty good deal?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;default&quot;&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c5a&quot;&gt;It depends on what the exact deal is. I'm sure that in this particular case it is a good deal, however I've seen such jobs where they literally exploited these poor people.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;15.805825242718&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Volunteering is awesome and I'm glad you have found a niche and are recommending it.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;For me, it's been excellent too but I chose something physical, challenging, outdoors and completely unrelated to tech. Selfishly, it's a needed change from sitting in front of a computer but still gives the satisfaction of helping people in deep ways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;But yes, directly helping people is deeply rewarding and satisfying. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;That being said a founder support group is an awesome thing. I really want to go to a VR one if such exists. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;this is a bit of an awkward question but.. have you ever come across anyone who you tried to teach but in the end was just not suited for coding? can everyone learn to code?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;athing comtr&quot; id=&quot;15733380&quot; readability=&quot;11.786350148368&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Any one can learn to code it isn't difficult to learn at all. Just like any one can learn math or english. What makes the difference is what level you can achieve. Just like math goes from elementary school to college level coding has a similar pattern where certain people get stuck in different areas. Hello world would be elementary level building large scalable enterprise application would be college level. You don't have to be able to build monsters applications that require knowing so much computer science that even physics and high level mathematics get involve. You can be a programmer that can build simple website that pays the bills. A entry level programmer doing simple website work makes $40,000 a year mattering your location and such. A senior arch developer makes around $400,000 a year also mattering location and such. Even some specialize areas pay their programmers $1,000,000 a year for what they can do. Some of the entry level people may make it to the top of the pile and some programmers will never leave that entry level position. I even know some programmers that are great, but decide to go another route. That has nothing to do with computers, because they get tired/burnout. Then I know some guys that are horrible programmers, but they enjoy it so much they just keep at it not caring.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;23.908952959029&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Not everyone can learn to code (well), imo. But, that's not an elitist coding-is-harder-than-other-things statement -- it's just the truth for any discipline.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Not everyone can draw/paint; not everyone can sing; not everyone can learn new languages proficiently; not everyone is good with numbers; not everyone is good at teaching; not everyone is good with working with other people; not everyone is athletic. And by this I mean that some will naturally be good at learning and ultimately mastering the above list of things, while others have to work much harder to get even close, with a lower ceiling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Most importantly though, it's not up to someone else to decide whether you're good at something or not. Everyone should have an opportunity to take class or learn a subject and find out for themselves if that's something that they're good at or naturally inclined to. And if they're not good at it, it's not the end of the world because there is something else that's probably more suitable for them that's just as important to this world as coding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The trouble we run into is that we often think of programming or coding as something more important or more sacred than other disciplines, when in reality it's just another in a long line of disciplines that takes practice and a little bit of natural talent. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Basic coding is rather simple and basically everyone can do that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Actually writing/designing larger applications is a skill most people don't have the time/patience to learn, similar to how most people can write on hackernews/twitter/facebook etc, but only few people can write a novel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Apart from the sequential understanding of how a computer operates, not everyone can express the goal in code that is, for lack of a better word, beautiful. Meaning 'easy' to read/follow, simple, expressive etc. And even less people can document/describe what happens, and even less people can see how the code they uses resources (cpu cycles,wait times,storage,etc) and thus cannot optimize appropriately. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;39.880739415623&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Since you asked, I'll try to share what I've learned. You can become incredibly effective if you invest in the skills to become a better teacher. Usually if someone is not learning, its the teacher not doing a good job.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;1. Test - before starting any topic, make sure your student has a grasp of the prerequisites by giving them simple tasks. Just because you have taught them the prerequisites a week ago does not mean that they didn't forget.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;2. When you are teaching them, talk as little as possible. The only thing you should be saying is the concepts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;3. Ask lots of questions. Ie: What is an object (expect them to repeat what you told them); What happens if (insert 10x different cases). Teach by asking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;4. Set 0 expectations. If you get frustrated its because you have expectations. Many people have self confidence issues. Being disappointed will cause your students emotional stress and they will not be able to learn. They might start to avoid asking you questions...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;5. Listen. Many times, your students could be saying what you wanted to hear, but worded differently. Their analogy could have the same concept as yours but very different. Learn to recognize what students are saying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I can't emphasize #3 enough. When I teach, I never say more than 2 sentences without asking a question. Because you quickly realize that people have a hard time retaining more than 2-3 sentences at a time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;You should 100% invest your time to get better at teaching. Teaching is a skill that schools robs from our childhood growing up. It helps you sympathize with people better, understand people better, communicate with people better, etc., all pretty real skills to have. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I've five weeks into working for myself and avoiding loneliness has become a key task for me every day. I wouldn't say I'm succeeding at it, to be honest. I know I could join a coworking space but I question whether it's worth $400+ a month when I wouldn't be able to attend the networking events since I have a family and need to be home at night. (And I don't need meeting space, and have a desk at home, and etc.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I've started going to Whole Foods to work during the day just to be around other people. Not that we necessarily interact, but, you know, it's something. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I needed some company some time ago and found a co-working space that I treated like a café - the coffee included, I brought my own lunch, and even though I'm not particularly sociable it was still much, much healthier than working alone and over time I got on fairly well with a group of people I still consider friends, though I've long since left. Have a look if there is something around you, you never know. And even just the looking gets you out of the house for a valid reason!&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;15.794871794872&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I get up at 5am every day to go to Starbucks at 6am every day. The &quot;stillness buzz&quot; of my apartment bugs me. I go to Starbucks and ignore everyone - but I still feel part of the mix.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I could, you know, go to the office, but everone interrupts me there. It's not lonely, but unproductive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The trick is to be productive, but to feel like a human in the mix. For me, Starbucks does that. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Some kind of optimized noise is a weird concept, but I've found that it really works, from time to time. Especially if I'm doing something that requires a great deal of concentration rather than just &quot;production&quot;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I've found being around others helps tremendously compared with working solo. I believe there have been academic studies into this as well. Being around other people who are &quot;productive&quot; (whether they really are or not) helps my mindset. I would study in the quiet chunks of the library with other people around me, particularly leading up to big exams.&lt;/span&gt;

There are other regulars that you start to recognize, say hi to as you stand in line, and catch up with. I've met fascinating people by working at Starbucks. Engineers, managers, musicians, nurses, all friendly and equally happy to have someone else to talk to. Plus, there's the baristas, who I've also found pleasant to talk to.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Some days, though, you are alone at Starbucks, but it's a different kind of alone than working at home all day every day. You're surrounded by people, and when the alternative is zero social contact during your work day, it can make a difference. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Maybe weird. But I don't like sitting in my quiet apartment alone working. (I'm not particularly lonely - I just like the energy better when I'm &quot;out&quot;) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

There really wasn't much conversion. It was a waste of money for me. I can work alone for a long time. It's just the loneliness that slowly builds up over a long time from not talking about the project with peers walking the same path that sucks.&lt;/span&gt;

I was at one for a few months that made a point of socializing. They had a portion of space dedicated to meetups from 7pm. They had 4-5 meetups a week. They organized dinner outings. One person organized a programmer meet up where he'd give out a short problem, have everyone solve it in their language of choice, then we'd have each person explain their solution, it was enlightening so see why each person made their choices.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I don't know how to know beforehand if a co-working space has lots of social activities or not, maybe see if they have an event page or a FB page showing past events. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I get to meet some people outside of my realm. That also appreciate me. That want to talk. Not about engineering stuff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Just show up with a pie and a smile - and ... you realize that: 1) everything isn't so bad, 2) we're all going to be here (perspective), and 3) they know more about life than you do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Give it a try. I've been doing it for 20 years. After my girlfriend at the time ended up a paraplegic from an accident, she ended up in rehab at one of these places. Other than her brain, she got better and left. I keep going back. YMMV.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;EDIT: My point is-- you aren't the only lonely person out there. Sometimes you have to take the first step to make a friend. Even outside of your realm of experience. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;32.795159896283&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Get yourself into a mastermind group with 2-5 others in a similar situation - solo founders, bootstrappers, etc. You can start with just 1 other person then add more.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Have a regular 1 hour video call every week or two. Everyone gives updates, support, and keeps each other accountable on goals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Keep a Slack/Skype channel open in between to say hi, help each other, share wins, etc. Bonus points for meeting locally, but online is fine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Why? Masterminds are the biggest thing I did going from wantreprenur to actually shipping &amp;amp; earning from products. They're also one of the best things you can do to beat entrepreneurial loneliness. Every week you meet other people who share your struggles and are invested in your success.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Here's a good resource for running one: &lt;a href=&quot;https://taylorpearson.me/mastermind/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://taylorpearson.me/mastermind/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;If you find at least 1 other person willing to do this (a few candidates on this thread already, or make a FB / LinkedIn post) I'll happily join the first one to facilitate &amp;amp; show how. Email in profile.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;P.S. A coworking space + online communities like founder cafe, product people, complice, wip.chat (h/t other posters) can also be super helpful. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For extroverts (or in my case, introvert-deliberately-turned-extrovert) energy, creativity and innovation are fueled by human interaction. I consider going solo, couped up in your sterile, quiet home office, to be a certain path to failure. I'm glad to finally have a discussion here where this is being recognized!&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;You bring up a good point when you talk of introverts vs. extroverts. I cannot see extroverts being happy working remotely. They seem to need the human interaction offered in the office. Personally, I'm an introvert. I don't like being around other people and find their presence irritating and unwelcome when I'm trying to get something done. For me, working remotely really IS the one true way. I cannot even relate to the author of the article's sense of loneliness. That certainly isn't true for everyone though. Rather than dictating one or the other, companies should be flexible and embrace both, I think, in order to get the most out of all their employees.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;You say you're happy to have a contrast to the usual, but here you are sort of arguing for the other extreme. There are plenty of people who have made amazing things in isolation and work well under those conditions. The point here is that not everyone is the same. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;What you're feeling is so very common among solo founders. I'm glad you're talking about it here. It is one of the most important conversations founders need to be having. Isolation has the power to undo you and your business. Like others have said co-working, masterminds, volunteering- those are all helpful ways to connect to other founders. We at &lt;a href=&quot;https://zenfounder.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://zenfounder.com/&lt;/a&gt; run ZenTribe groups for founders. Our groups are small and co-facilitated by me (a psychologist) and an experienced founder. There's also &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastermindjam.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://mastermindjam.com/&lt;/a&gt; which helps people find a mastermind. Smallish conferences are a helpful way to make some friends that you can keep in touch with: &lt;a href=&quot;https://rhodiumweekend.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://rhodiumweekend.com/&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microconf.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.microconf.com/&lt;/a&gt; are oriented toward connecting people and encourage people to form masterminds.

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I work remotely for my current job and am also working on a startup so I can relate to the feelings of loneliness.. I intentionally took a remote work job to try to figure out more about myself and what I really want long-term. Establishing a routine helps a lot, for example I like to use a standing desk at home for a couple hours but after that I'm usually about to go crazy so I go out to work in public, usually a coffee shop. Then, from there I may stay out the rest of the day, switching venues at least once, or come back home depending on how I'm feeling. Then I to to go to the gym when I'm done working. This seems to have helped my feel a lot better than when I would just stay home all day. Another thing I've realized is I hate the area I live because I have to drive everywhere and being able to walk places makes me much happier so I'm figuring how to eventually move somewhere that's a better fit. Also, I've gotten into traveling, I have a little camper I travel with sometimes and work in that. I basically do the exact same routine when traveling but just the added stimulation of being somewhere different. I've developed a lot of interest in learning about how the brain works and one thing I've read is that the main purpose of having complex brains is for motor control and movement, I don't have a good source off the top of my head but it's an easy topic to look up. Basically, though, what I take from it is that it's hard for most people to truly be happy sitting idle in one place all day because it's very unnatural.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I thought it would better than working from home, on my own all the time, but in a way it ends up worse. I'm in an office with a load of other people but I can't talk to any of them. It can feel a lot more isolating than if I was just sitting alone at home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The only time I see friends is at weekends, so if I don't go out on one weekend, I can easily go 6 days a week without having a face to face chat with an actual real person.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;It's been a big shift from my previous company where going to work felt like going and hanging out with my mates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I'm not sure how long I'll be able to do this, I feel it can't be good for your mental health long term. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Any person who takes on tasks where there is high degree of uncertainty will feel lonely because the vast majority of people around you do not do that or even have the mindset to do that. In short even if you were surrounded by a lot of caring people, you may not be able to relate to them. I think you will get substantial mileage if the support group is trying to solve a similar problem as your are, but you may not, if their domain of work is significantly different than yours. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

I can not recommend her enough.&lt;/span&gt;

And she has told me that the most common thing she works with is people thinking they are alone. And they are! Because the specific challenges founders face are unique to them and that compounds the feeling of &quot;no one understands.&quot; But that doesn't mean community and counsel can't help immensely.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;If you feel this way please get in touch with Sherry or listen to her podcasts and read the content. It can change your perspective and help embolden you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I'm also a solo founder in need of a support network. This is not about working around people but meeting up once a week for about an hour or so and sharing our progress and struggles and encouraging each other. Glad to know you are not alone.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;When I used to work alone, I had to schedule regular social interactions to keep from getting lonely (coffee or lunch with friends, meetups, etc...)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;It's important to focus on your startup, but it's impossible to do that unless you take care of your mental (and physical) health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;If you're into exercise and working out, try going OUT (shopping, cafe, people mingling, malls) in the 2-3 hours right after a workout. Your energy levels are raised, you're a lot more vocal, relaxed and &quot;open&quot; along with a positive physical glow and a smile on your face. You are at peak likelihood of engaging in small talk with people in this state.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;6.9375&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;In addition to the suggestions about sitting in cafes, I'd suggest you look at places like museums and art galleries. In the UK at least, many have members' rooms. An annual membership plus guest might be in the region of £100-200. Beyond the benefits people have listed with cafes, your money will be going to a good place. Shop around. Some places are great, and with the +1 membership you can even invite a business partner. Or ask your friends to see if someone would benefit from coming along with you.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Far cheaper than typical startup desk-rental. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Taking breaks from your work is just as important as working itself. If you are single I would also suggest grindr/tinder which ever pulls your rope.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;It doesn't help with loneliness, but at least you have a person to talk to about what you're doing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;If you're working only on your startup, I'd recommend not burning too much time on it, and using the other time on other activities with other people. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;A while back I was playing around on shodan looking for open webcams and found a few where you 'could log in and see people working'. Or, mostly, watch people who probably should be doing something productive not actually working.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;My favorite was a town square in Bulgaria, wonder if that one's still open... &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Also: go to meetups. Talk online with your developers (if you employ them) with screensharing etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;And your FAMILY -- the perfect opportunity to spend time with them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Don't let American mores of individualism keep you from spending way more time with your family. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;45.927718416091&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Solo founder here. I found the first few months of my startup so tough that I must've googled &lt;em&gt;Successful solo founders?&lt;/em&gt; a half dozen times. I'm sure you've done the same and there's a lot of stuff out there from PG, Altman, Quora et al. describing how solo founders are far less likely to succeed vs co-founders and I personally think it's not just the shared work load aspect (which is definitely big) but the fact that is lonely at the top.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;That said I can tell you what helped me:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;1. Good family and friends. Your support network is key - it will support you both financially and emotionally. After a hard day or a bad meeting I have someone I can talk to for advice or just to vent. Having great advisors there to tell you when you're on track or off track is incredibly important. They could be your SO, a successful Aunt/Uncle or even your parents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;2. Co-working space. After several months of trying to code my prototype at home and getting very little done compared to my previous day job where I was very productive I realized I needed to get out the house. Try telling a three year old 'no' when they're tugging on your finger and asking &quot;Daddy, wanna play?&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Co-working is an expensive option at £400 odd per month and some angel investors will poo-poo it as a waste in those early months but for me it literally changed my business. Not only was I able to (finally) code after months of being stuck in a rut but just by being in close proximity to successful professionals and attending networking events nearby I felt energized to keep trucking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;3. Networking. Talk to people, attend networking events (I attend 2-3 a year at most right now so it doesn't need to be nuts to start with). These people become your vendors, your contractors and sometimes your future mentors and employees. A ready smile and willingness to push myself a little and chat with folk about their companies and problems has helped me solve my own company's problems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;4. Save money. Sounds simple but as a solo founder you have almost HALF the contacts a two man founding team has. Your money pool to dip into is also considerably lower. Keep your burn rate low as possible but not too low! Invest in your training (Safari Books, online courses). I didn't hire anyone to help me or buy an expensive computer until I'd built my prototype and demo'd the concept to my friends and family. Of course I'm a coder so if you're not that might be easier said than done!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;5. Effective time management. Accept that some days just getting to your desk and answering emails is gonna seem like you're trying to climb a mountain. That's normal. Calendaring helped me with this - by scheduling certain afternoons as my &quot;Do whatever you like&quot; period I was able to look forward to an art exhibition or going to a beautiful library downtown and reading some business and management books. It's different for everyone but do schedule your week to help avoid poor time management.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;There's loads of stuff you can do and I could probably write for hours on the subject. I'd say the TLDR; is to have a good support network since flying solo is emotionally tough and to have a productive space where you can work. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;There is something deeply dysfunctional in our profession when people identify as &quot;founders&quot; instead of &quot;engineers&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a new type we are adding to the platform to represent contiguous regions of arbitrary memory, with performance characteristics on par with &lt;code&gt;T[]&lt;/code&gt;. Its APIs are similar to the array, but unlike arrays, it can point to either managed or native memory, or to memory allocated on the stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-cs&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;// managed memory&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;arrayMemory &lt;/span&gt;= &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;];
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;arraySpan &lt;/span&gt;= &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Span&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;(arrayMemory);

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;// native memory&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;nativeMemory &lt;/span&gt;= &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Marshal.AllocHGlobal&lt;/span&gt;(100);
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Span&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;nativeSpan&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;unsafe&lt;/span&gt; {
    nativeSpan = &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Span&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;(nativeMemory.ToPointer(), &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;);
}
SafeSum(nativeSpan);
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Marshal.FreeHGlobal&lt;/span&gt;(nativeMemory);

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;// stack memory&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Span&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;stackSpan&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;unsafe&lt;/span&gt; {
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;* &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;stackMemory&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;stackalloc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;];
    stackSpan = &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Span&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;(stackMemory, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;);
}
SafeSum(stackSpan);
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is an abstraction over all types of memory available to .NET programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-cs&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;// this method does not care what kind of memory it works on&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;ulong &lt;/span&gt;SafeSum(Span&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; bytes) {
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;ulong&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;; i &amp;lt; bytes.Length; i++) {
        sum += bytes[i];
    }
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; sum;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When wrapping an array, &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is not limited to pointing to the first element of the array. It can point to any sub-range. In other words, it supports slicing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-cs&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;array &lt;/span&gt;= &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;[] { &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; };
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;slice &lt;/span&gt;= &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Span&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;(array, start:1, length:2);
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Console.WriteLine&lt;/span&gt;(slice[0]); &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;// prints 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;API Surface&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full API surface of &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is not yet finalized, but the main APIs we will expose are the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-cs&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Span&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; {
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Span&lt;/span&gt;(T[] array)
    public &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Span&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;[] &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;)
    public &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Span&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;[] &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;)
    public unsafe &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Span&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;* &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;memory&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;)

    public static implicit operator &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Span&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;ArraySegment&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;arraySegment&lt;/span&gt;);
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;implicit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;operator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Span&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; (T[] array);

    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;public &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Length&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;; }
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/span&gt; T this[int index] { &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;; }

    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Span&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Slice&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;);
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Span&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Slice&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;);
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;TryCopyTo&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;[] &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;destination&lt;/span&gt;);
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;TryCopyTo&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Span&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;destination&lt;/span&gt;);

    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;[] &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;ToArray&lt;/span&gt;();
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we will provide a read-only version of &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is required to represent slices of immutable and read-only structures, e.g. System.String slices. This is discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scenarios&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a small, but critical, building block for a much larger effort to provide .NET APIs to enable development of high scalability server applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The .NET Framework design philosophy has focused almost solely on productivity for developers writing application software. In addition, many of the Framework’s design decisions were made assuming Windows client-server applications circa 1999. This design philosophy is a big part of .NET’s success as .NET is universally viewed as a very high productivity platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the landscape has shifted since our platform was conceived almost 20 years ago. We now target non-Windows operating systems, our developers write cloud hosted services demanding different tradeoffs than client-server applications, the state of the art patterns have moved away from once popular technologies like XML, UTF16, SOAP (to name a few), and the hardware running today’s software is very different than what was available 20 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we analyze the gaps we have today and the requirements of today’s high scale servers, we realize that we need to provide modern no-copy, low-allocation, and UTF8 data transformation APIs that are efficient, reliable, and easy to use. Prototypes of such APIs are available in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dotnet/corefxlab&quot;&gt;corefxlab repository&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is one of the main fundamental building blocks for these APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Data Pipelines&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern servers are often designed as, often reactive, pipelines of components doing transformations on byte buffers. For example, such pipeline in a web server might consist of the following transformations: socket fills in a buffer -&amp;gt; HTTP parsing -&amp;gt; decompression -&amp;gt; Base 64 decoding -&amp;gt; routing -&amp;gt; HTML writing -&amp;gt; HTML escaping -&amp;gt; HTTP writing -&amp;gt; compression -&amp;gt; socket writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;byte&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is very useful for implementing transformation routines of such data pipelines. First, &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; allows the server to freely switch between managed and native buffers depending on situation/settings. For example, Windows RIO sockets work best with native buffers, and libuv Kestrel works best with pinned managed arrays. Secondly, it allows complicated transformation algorithms to be implemented in safe code without the need to resort to using raw pointers. Lastly, the fact that &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is slicable allows the pipeline to abstract away the physical chunks of buffers, treating them as uniform logical chunks relevant to that particular section of the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stack-only nature of &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (see more on this below) allows pooled memory to be safely returned to the pool after the transformation pipeline completes, and allows the pipeline to pass only the relevant slice of the buffer to each transformation routine/component. In other words, &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; aids in lifetime management of pooled buffers, which is critical to the performance of today's servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Discontinuous Buffers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As alluded to before, data pipelines often process data in chunks as they arrive at a socket. This creates problems for data transformation routines such as parsing, which often have to deal with data that can reside in two or more buffers. For example, there might be a need to parse an integer residing partially in one buffer and partially in another. Since spans can abstract stack memory, they can solve this problem in a very elegant and performant way as illustrated in the following routine from ASP.NET Channels pipeline (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/davidfowl/Channels/blob/master/src/Channels.Text.Primitives/ReadableBufferExtensions.cs#L81&quot;&gt;full source&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-cs&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;unsafe&lt;/span&gt; static uint &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;GetUInt32&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;ReadableBuffer&lt;/span&gt; buffer) {
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;ReadOnlySpan&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;textSpan&lt;/span&gt;;

    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (buffer.IsSingleSpan) { &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;// if data in single buffer, it’s easy&lt;/span&gt;
        textSpan = buffer.First.Span;
    }
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (buffer.Length &amp;lt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;128&lt;/span&gt;) { &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;// else, consider temp buffer on stack&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;data &lt;/span&gt;= &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;stackalloc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;128&lt;/span&gt;];
        &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;destination &lt;/span&gt;= &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Span&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;(data, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;128&lt;/span&gt;);
        buffer.CopyTo(destination);
        textSpan = destination.Slice(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;, buffer.Length);
    }
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; {
        &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;// else pay the cost of allocating an array&lt;/span&gt;
        textSpan = &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;ReadOnlySpan&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;(buffer.ToArray());
    }

    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;uint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;utf8Buffer &lt;/span&gt;= &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Utf8String&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;textSpan&lt;/span&gt;);
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;// yet the actual parsing routine is always the same and simple&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (!PrimitiveParser.TryParseUInt32(utf8Buffer, out &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;)) {
        &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;InvalidOperationException&lt;/span&gt;();
    }
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Non-Allocating Substring&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern server protocols are more often than not text-based, and so it's not surprising that such servers often create and manipulate lots of strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most common basic string operations is string slicing. Currently, &lt;code&gt;System.String.Substring&lt;/code&gt; is the main .NET API for creating slices of a string, but the API is inefficient as it creates a new string to represent the slice and copies the characters from the original string to the new string slice. Because of this inefficiency, high performance servers shy away from using this API, where they can (in their internals), and pay the cost in the publicly facing APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; could be a much more efficient standard representation of a subsection of a string:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-cs&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;ReadOnlySpan&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; {
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;ReadOnlySpan&lt;/span&gt;(T[] array)
    public &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;ReadOnlySpan&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;[] &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;)
    public &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;ReadOnlySpan&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;[] &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;)
    public unsafe &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;ReadOnlySpan&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;* &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;memory&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;)

    public int Length { &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;; }
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; this[int index] { &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;; }

    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;ReadOnlySpan&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;T&amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Slice&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;)

    public bool &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;TryCopyTo&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;[] &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;destination&lt;/span&gt;);
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;TryCopyTo&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Span&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;destination&lt;/span&gt;);
}

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;ReadOnlySpan&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;lengthText&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;content-length:123&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Slice&lt;/span&gt;(15);
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Parsing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the .NET parsing APIs require the exact string representing the text being parsed to be passed as the argument to the APIs:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Parse&lt;/span&gt;(&quot;123&quot;);
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Parse&lt;/span&gt;(&quot;content-length:123&quot;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Substring&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;)); &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;// this allocates&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not have APIs that can parse a slice of a string or a text buffer without the need to first allocate a substring representing the text being parsed. &lt;code&gt;ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;-based APIs, together with non-allocating substring APIs discussed above, could solve this problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-cs&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;SpanParsingExtensions&lt;/span&gt; {
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;TryParse&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;ReadOnlySpan&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; text, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;)
}

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;content-length:123&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Slice&lt;/span&gt;(15).&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;TryParse&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The API can be further improved (take in &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;byte&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) to parse text buffers regardless of the encoding (e.g. UTF8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-cs&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;SpanParsingExtensions&lt;/span&gt; {
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;TryParse&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;ReadOnlySpan&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; text, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;EncodingData&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;encoding&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;)
}

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;byteArray&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;[]{&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;49&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;51&lt;/span&gt;};
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;bytesFromStringSlice&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;content-length:123&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.Slice(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;).As&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;();
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;bytesFromUtf8StringSlice&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Utf8String&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;content-length:123&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;).Slice(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;);

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;byteArray.TryParse&lt;/span&gt;(EncodingData.Utf8, out int value);
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;bytesFromStringSlice.TryParse&lt;/span&gt;(EncodingData.Utf16, out int value);
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;bytesFromUtf8StringSlice.TryParse&lt;/span&gt;(EncodingData.Utf8, out int value);
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Formatting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, formatting (the reverse of parsing) can be very elegantly and efficiently done on existing memory buffers backed by slices of arrays, native buffers, and stack allocated arrays. For Example, the following routine from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dotnet/corefxlab/blob/master/src/System.Text.Primitives/System/Text/Formatting/PrimitiveFormatter.cs#L41&quot;&gt;corfxlab&lt;/a&gt; formats an integer (as UTF8 text) into an arbitrary byte buffer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-cs&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;bool &lt;/span&gt;TryFormat(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;, Span&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; buffer, out &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int &lt;/span&gt;bytesWritten)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Buffer Pooling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; can be used to pool memory from a large single buffer allocated on the native heap. This decreases [pointless] work the GC needs to perform to manage pooled buffers, which never get collected anyway, but often need to be permanently pinned, which is bad for the system. Also, the fact that native memory does not move lowers the cost of interop and the cost of pool related error checking (e.g. checking if a buffer is already returned to the pool).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, the stack-only nature of &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; makes lifetime management of pooled memory more reliable; it helps in avoiding use-after-free errors with pooled memory. Without &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, it’s often not clear when a pooled buffer that was passed to a separate module can be returned to the pool, as the module could be holding to the buffer for later use. With &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, the server pipeline can be sure that there are no more references to the buffer after the stack pops to the frame that first allocated the span and passed it down to other modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Native code interop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, unmanaged buffers passed over unmanaged to managed boundary are frequently copied to &lt;code&gt;byte[]&lt;/code&gt; to allow safe access from managed code. &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; can eliminate the need to copy in many such scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, a number of performance critical APIs in the Framework take unsafe pointers as input. Examples include &lt;code&gt;Encoding.GetChars&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Buffer.MemoryCopy&lt;/code&gt;. Over time, we should provide more safe APIs that use &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which will allow more code to compile as safe but still preserve its performance characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support the scenarios described above, &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; must meet the following requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ability to wrap managed and native memory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance characteristics on par with arrays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be memory-safe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will provide two different implementations of &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fast &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (available on runtimes with special support for spans)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slow &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (available on all current .NET runtimes, even existing ones, e.g. .NET 4.5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fast implementation, will rely on &quot;ref field&quot; support and will look as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-cs&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Span&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; {
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;internal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;_pointer&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;internal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;_length&lt;/span&gt;;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prototype of such fast &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/src/mscorlib/shared/System/Span.cs&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Through the magic of the &quot;ref field&quot;, it can support slicing without requiring a strong pointer to the root of the sliced object. The GC is able to trace the interior pointer, keep the root object alive, and update the interior pointer if the object is relocated during a collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A different representation will be implemented for platforms that don’t support ref fields (interior pointers):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-cs&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Span&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; {
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;internal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;IntPtr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;_pointer&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;internal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;_relocatableObject&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;internal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;_length&lt;/span&gt;;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prototype of this design can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Memory/src/System/Span.cs&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In this representation, the &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;'s indexer will add the &lt;code&gt;_pointer&lt;/code&gt; and the address of &lt;code&gt;_relocatableObject&lt;/code&gt; before accessing items in the Span. This will make the accessor slower, but it will ensure that when the GC moves the sliced object (e.g. array) in memory, the indexer still accesses the right memory location. Note that if the Span wraps a managed object, the &lt;code&gt;_pointer&lt;/code&gt; field will be the offset off the object's root to the objects data slice, but if the Span wraps a native memory, the &lt;code&gt;_pointer&lt;/code&gt; will point to the memory and the &lt;code&gt;_relocatableObject&lt;/code&gt; will be set to null (zero). In either case, adding the pointer and the address of the object &lt;code&gt;(null == 0)&lt;/code&gt; results in the right &quot;effective&quot; address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Struct Tearing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Struct tearing is a threading issue that affects all structs larger than what can be atomically updated on the target processor architecture. For example, some 64-bit processors can only update one 64-bit aligned memory block atomically. This means that some processors won’t be able to update both the &lt;code&gt;_pointer&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;_length&lt;/code&gt; fields of the Span atomically. This in turn means that the following code, might result in another thread observing &lt;code&gt;_pointer&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_length&lt;/code&gt; fields belonging to two different spans (the original one and the one being assigned to the field):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-cs&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;internal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Buffer&lt;/span&gt; {
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Span&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;_memory&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;1024&lt;/span&gt;];

    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Resize&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;newSize&lt;/span&gt;) {
        _memory = &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;[newSize]; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;// this will not update atomically&lt;/span&gt;
    }

    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;public &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;byte &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;] =&amp;gt; _memory[&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;]; // &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;might&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;see&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;partial&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most structs, tearing is at most a correctness bug and can be dealt with by making the fields (typed as the tearable struct type) non-public and synchronizing access to them. But since Span needs to be as fast as the array, access to the field cannot be synchronized. Also, because of the fact that Span accesses (and writes to) memory directly, having the &lt;code&gt;_pointer&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;_length&lt;/code&gt; be out of sync could result in memory safety being compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only other way (besides synchronizing access, which would be not practical) to avoid this issue is to make Span a stack-only type, i.e. its instances can reside only on the stack (which is accessed by one thread).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; will be stack-only&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will be a stack-only type; more precisely, it will be a by-ref type (just like its field in the fast implementation). This means that Spans cannot be boxed, cannot appear as a field of a non-stack-only type, and cannot be used as a generic argument. However, &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; can be used as a type of method arguments or return values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose to make &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; stack-only as it solves several problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Efficient representation and access: &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; can be just managed pointer and length.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Efficient GC tracking: limit number of interior pointers that the GC have to track. Tracking of interior pointers in the heap during GC would be pretty expensive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safe concurrency (struct tearing discussed above): &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; assignment does not have to be atomic. Atomic assignment would be required for storing &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; on the heap to avoid data tearing issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safe lifetime: Safe code cannot create dangling pointers by storing it on the heap when &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; points to unmanaged memory or stack memory. The unsafe stack frame responsible for creating unsafe Span is responsible for ensuring that it won’t escape the scope.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reliable buffer pooling: buffers can be rented from a pool, wrapped in spans, the spans passed to user code, and when the stack unwinds, the program can reliably return the buffer to the pool as it can be sure that there are no outstanding references to the buffer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fast representation makes the type instances automatically stack-only, i.e. the constraint will be enforced by the CLR. This restriction should also be enforced by managed language compilers and/or analyzers for better developer experience. For the slow &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, language compiler checks and/or analyzers is the only option (as the runtimes won't enforce the stack-only restriction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Memory&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As alluded to above, in the upcoming months, many data transformation components in .NET (e.g. Base64Encoding, compressions, formatting, parsing) will provide APIs operating on memory buffers. We will do this work to develop no-copy/low-allocation end-to-end data pipelines, like the ASP.NET Channels. These APIs will use a collection of types, including, but not limited to, &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, to represent various data pipeline primitives and exchange types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new collection of types must be usable by two distinct sets of customers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Productivity developers (99% case): these are the developers who use LINQ, async, lambdas, etc., and often for good reasons care more about productivity than squeezing the last cycles out of some low level transformation routines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low level developers (1% case): our library and framework authors for whom performance is a critical aspect of their work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the goals of each group are different, they rely on each other to be successful. One is a necessary consumer of the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stack-only type with the associated trade-offs is great for low level developers writing data transformation routines. Productivity developers, writing apps, may not be so thrilled when they realize that when using stack-only types, they lose many of the language features they rely on to get their jobs done (e.g. async await). And so, a stack-only type simply can’t be the primary exchange type we recommend for high level developers/scenarios/APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the whole platform to be successful, we must add an exchange type, currently called &lt;code&gt;Memory&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, that can be used with the full power of the language, i.e. it’s not stack-only. &lt;code&gt;Memory&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; can be seen as a “promise” of a Span. It can be freely used in generics, stored on the heap, used with async await, and all the other language features we all love. When &lt;code&gt;Memory&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is finally ready to be manipulated by a data transformation routine, it will be temporarily converted to a span (the promise will be realized), which will provide much more efficient (remember &quot;on par with array&quot;) access to the buffer's data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See a prototype of &lt;code&gt;Memory&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Memory/src/System/Memory.cs&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Note that the prototype is currently not tearing safe. We will make it safe in the upcoming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Optimizations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to enable the existing array bounds check optimizations for &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; – in both the static compiler and the JIT – to make its performance on par with arrays. Longer term, we should optimize struct passing and construction to make slicing operations on Spans more efficient. Today, we recommend that Spans are sliced only when a shorted span needs to be passed to a different routine. Within a single routine, code should do index arithmetic to access subranges of spans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conversions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will support reinterpret cast conversions to &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;byte&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. It will also support unsafe casts between arbitrary primitive types. The reason for this limitation is that some processors don’t support efficient unaligned memory access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prototype of such API can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dotnet/corefxlab/blob/7f7a0a4fa491c94fdc7cf0ebd01e9af44991c487/src/System.Slices/System/SpanExtensions.cs#L151&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and the API can be used as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-cs&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;bytes &lt;/span&gt;= &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Span&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;(buffer);
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;characters &lt;/span&gt;= &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;bytes.Cast&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;, char&amp;gt;();
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;IsLower&lt;/span&gt;(characters[0]) { ... }
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Platform Support Plans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to ship &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; as a NuGet fat package available for .NET Standard 1.1 and above. Runtimes that support by-ref fields and returns will get the fast ref-field &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Other runtimes will get the slower three-field &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Relationship to Array Slicing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will be a stack-only type, it’s not well suited as the general representation of array slice. When an array is sliced, majority of our users expect the result to be either an array, or at least a type that is very similar to the array (e.g. &lt;code&gt;ArraySegment&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;). We will design array slicing separately from &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Covariance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;code&gt;T[]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will not support covariant casts, i.e. cast &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;Subtype&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;Basetype&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Because of that, we won’t be doing covariance checks when storing references in &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Language Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately from this document, we are exploring language features to better support &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enforcement of Stack-Only Type Restrictions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;   &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will be included in the set of built-in stack-only types. Any other struct containing one of these will be transitively considered a stack-only type. The compiler will error if a stack-only type is used in a disallowed context, e.g. used as a type argument, placed on the heap (boxed, passed to asynchronous call, used as a field of a class, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language Support for pinning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-cs&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Span&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;buffer&lt;/span&gt; = ...
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;fixed&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;* &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;pBuffer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; buffer){
    ...
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slicing syntax&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;   C# compiler will add slicing syntax, and &lt;code&gt;Memory&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will support it. The details are TBD, but imagine that a[1..5] calls a.Slice(1, 5) or a.Slice(new Range(1, 5)). &lt;code&gt;c# Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; span = ... var slice = span[1..5];&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safe &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; stackalloc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-cs&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;SafeMethod&lt;/span&gt;() {
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Span&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;buffer&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;stackalloc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;128&lt;/span&gt;];
    PrimitiveFormatter.TryFormat(buffer, DateTime.Now, ...);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primitive constraint&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; operations are valid only for so called primitive type arguments. For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dotnet/corefxlab/blob/7f7a0a4fa491c94fdc7cf0ebd01e9af44991c487/src/System.Slices/System/SpanExtensions.cs#L151&quot;&gt;reinterpret cast operation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are exploring adding the ability to constrain type parameters to primitive types, i.e. types that are bit blittable. The cast operation would constrain its type parameters as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-cs&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Span&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;U&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Cast&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;U&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;Span&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; slice) &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;primitive&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;U&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;primitive&lt;/span&gt;
{ ... }
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Detailed design of &lt;code&gt;Memory&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;    - Representation
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Operations&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Type of the Length property&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Stockfish Wins Chess.com Computer Championship</title>
<link>https://www.chess.com/news/view/stockfish-wins-chess-com-computer-championship</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;The powerful, open-source chess engine &lt;strong&gt;Stockfish&lt;/strong&gt; narrowly beat out two strong commercial engines to win the first &lt;strong&gt;Chess.com Computer Chess Championship&lt;/strong&gt; this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img lazy-img=&quot;https://images.chesscomfiles.com/uploads/v1/images_users/tiny_mce/pete/php6Jtj83.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;imageUploaderImg&quot; alt=&quot;null&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stockfish placed clear first in the 10-engine round robin to reach the superfinal, and then edged the second-place &lt;strong&gt;Houdini&lt;/strong&gt; in the rapid, blitz, and bullet finals to win the championship, which was shown on Chess.com's live server Nov. 13 through 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img lazy-img=&quot;https://images.chesscomfiles.com/uploads/v1/images_users/tiny_mce/pete/phpMJa2IH.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;imageUploaderImg&quot; alt=&quot;null&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chess.com Computer Chess Championship &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chess.com/article/view/chess-com-announces-computer-chess-championship&quot;&gt;was announced in September&lt;/a&gt; and featured the 10 strongest chess engines in the world. Three days of round-robin rapid play determined the top two engines, who faced off in a thrilling superfinal for the title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img lazy-img=&quot;https://images.chesscomfiles.com/uploads/v1/images_users/tiny_mce/pete/phpJD0yag.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;imageUploaderImg&quot; alt=&quot;null&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All four days of the championship were covered live on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.Twitch.tv/chess&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Twitch.tv/chess&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.Chess.com/TV&quot;&gt;Chess.com/TV&lt;/a&gt;, with master commentary by IM Daniel Rensch and GM Robert Hess, making it the first computer tournament to be broadcast in real time with professional production and live announcers. Full video replays of all four days of coverage can be watched in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/collections/8WUubpvW9hQWcw&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Twitch archives. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of the tournament was to showcase the strength and beauty of computer chess in a viewer-friendly, rapid and blitz tournament so that the audience could follow along in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img lazy-img=&quot;https://images.chesscomfiles.com/uploads/v1/images_users/tiny_mce/pete/php4lxxUF.png&quot; class=&quot;imageUploaderImg&quot; alt=&quot;null&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, there was some serious computer science behind the event, as each engine played from a powerful Amazon Web Services computer. For more technical details on the engine and hardware configuration, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chess.com/article/view/chess-com-announces-computer-chess-championship&quot;&gt;announcement article.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img lazy-img=&quot;https://images.chesscomfiles.com/uploads/v1/images_users/tiny_mce/pete/phpYu8Bda.png&quot; class=&quot;imageUploaderImg&quot; alt=&quot;null&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One major facet of the tournament format was that there were no opening books, forcing each engine to independently make every one of its moves. The engines were strong enough to derive some serious opening theory on the fly, with most games following solid and established opening lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Norm Schmidt, Chess.com's technical advisor for the tournament, here is the breakdown of openings &quot;chosen&quot; by the engines and the results of the games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;French Defense = 44 games, 7 white wins, 28 draws, 9 black wins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Queens Pawn/Gambit = 30 games, 14 white wins, 11 draws, 5 black wins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Queen's Indian Defense = 11 games, 3 white wins, 6 draws, 2 black wins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Ruy Lopez = 6 games, 2 white wins, 4 draws, 0 black wins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Caro–Kann Defense = 5 games, 0 white wins, 4 draws, 1 black win&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Sicilian = 4 games, 0 white wins, 3 draws, 1 black win&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the world's top 10 engines were slotted into the tournament, most of the attention was on the &quot;big three&quot; engines of Stockfish, Komodo, and Houdini, universally considered the three strongest engines of all time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three engines battled fiercely in the round robin, with Houdini needing a brilliant win in the last round to clinch its spot in the superfinal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Round Robin Final Standings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The superfinal itself came down to the very last set of games, as Stockfish took a one-point lead into the set of four bullet games. Two of those four games were decisive, with Houdini and Stockfish each notching exciting wins, allowing Stockfish to take the title.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Founder Salary Calculator</title>
<link>http://christophjanz.blogspot.com/2017/11/unsure-how-much-you-should-pay-yourself.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://christophjanz.blogspot.com/2017/11/unsure-how-much-you-should-pay-yourself.html</guid>
<description>Founder salaries are not a topic I’ve had to spend a lot of time with so far. I usually just “OK” them, since the founders we are working with are all super reasonable people who carefully weigh how much they need against the interests of the company – their company. But sometimes founders ask me for a suggestion or some guidance because they are uncertain as to what is fair, and so I thought it might be useful to create a simple model.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15xRVMp_Ng-Sjfh9pDZb1X1d66Elv9PTqPzvWEH7XOXI/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here it is&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Like it? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/founder-salary-calculator&quot;&gt;Upvote it!&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model calculates the founder salary based on three drivers: stage, family situation, and location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless you’re in the fortunate position to generate revenues almost from day 1 or to raise a sizable seed round right at the start you’ll probably not be able to pay yourself any salary at all, at least in the first few months, for the simple fact that the company doesn’t have any money to spend. If you raise a small angel or friends &amp;amp; family round, you’ll probably want to spend it on other things than founder salaries. Once you’ve raised a bigger seed round and/or you start to generate revenues, that changes and you can pay yourself a modest salary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the calculator, I’ve assumed that the “entry salary” for a Berlin-based founder who doesn’t have kids is $50,000. I’ve then assumed that that amount increases to $75,000, $95,000 and $115,000 when you reach funding and revenue milestones that roughly correspond with a Series A, Series B and Series C round, respectively. I don’t think founders should get salaries that make them rich, but as soon as the company can afford it the founders should get enough so that they don’t have to be worried about how to make ends meet all the time. And if a little more allows them to outsource some errands and chores after a 100-hour-work-week I’m all for it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might surprise you to hear this from a venture capitalist, but my approach to founder salaries is a little communistic: I think founder salaries should not be based on performance alone but should also take into account what the founder needs. If that means that one founder gets more cash than the others because in contrast to them he or she has a family to take care of, that’s fine with me. A founder’s cash compensation doesn’t reflect the value which she contributes to the company anyway, so who cares if one of them gets a little more than the others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My model, therefore, assumes that for each kid you add $10,000 (multiplied by the location factor, more on that soon). Whether this is the right amount is of course debatable, and there can be other aspects besides having children that need to be taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “need-based” approach can, of course, go both ways: if a founder had a sizable exit already, he may want to forgo his salary or reduce it to a symbolic amount, at least in the first few years. I did that at my last startup, Pageflakes, and thought that besides saving the company some money it can also have a positive impact on the company culture if people know that the founder’s interests are 100% tied to the company’s success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third factor that I’ve included is location. I’ve defined Berlin as 1.0x and have assumed that in Paris, London and San Francisco, you’ll have to pay yourself 1.3x, 1.5x and 1.8x as much in order to have a similar standard of living. These ratios are roughly in line with the data published on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to find out the ratios for other cities, take a look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The numbers in the model reflect what I think is market and fair based on the data points that we have and some industry benchmarks that we were able to get. However, our data set is quite limited and the numbers produced by the calculator should by no means be taken as the ultimate truth. &lt;strong&gt;If you disagree with my assumptions or have seen different numbers in the market I’d love to hear from you!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I saw a &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/01/14/salary-founder-favorite-startup-get-probably-high-one/&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; according to which founder salaries are much lower. According to this data source, 75% of Silicon Valley based founders pay themselves less than $75,000, with 66% paying themselves less than $50,000. Based on these numbers, even for companies that have raised more than $10M the average salary is only $81,700. This looked odd to me, and maybe the difference is due to the fact that the study is three years old. I ignored this data source for now, but again, suggestions and input are very much appreciated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The model assumes that the founder gets a fixed salary with no bonus. I’m not strongly against including a bonus component in a founder’s package, but I think it’s usually not necessary. If you own a big chunk of equity, I don’t think you’ll need a performance bonus to be motivated and rewarded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The model doesn’t differentiate between the founding CEO, tech founder and other roles. In the first couple of years it’s usually not necessary to differentiate based on the founder’s role because everyone in the founder team carries a similar load. At a later stage, when the company has a bigger leadership team, it makes sense that the CEO gets more than the other founders. The numbers in the model are calibrated for founder CEOs, so you may want to reduce the amounts for other founders at the Series B or C stage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The calculator shows the results for the various stages and locations simultaneously, so you can easily compare the numbers side-by-side. The number of kids, however, needs to be entered (column I). If you enter a different value here, the numbers in column K and column P will be updated accordingly. Showing the results for various numbers of kids simultaneously would have added a lot of additional permutations and would have made the sheet very large.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The blue numbers are input variables and you can change them if you’d like to adjust the model. The brown numbers can be changed, too, but aren’t used as inputs for the calculation. To play around with the numbers please make a copy (File &amp;gt; Make a copy).&lt;/li&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Only scalars, vectors, and matrices are displayed as output. If the derivative is a higher order tensor it will be computed but not displayed since there is no (good) representation of higher order tensors by matrices. For instance, differentiating the matrix expression &lt;span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; with respect to the matrix &lt;span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; yields the 4th order identity tensor. It will not be displayed.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How Facebook&amp;#039;s Instagram Acquisition Led to the Open Sourcing of React.js</title>

<description>&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d26dzxoao6i3hh.cloudfront.net/items/0I2O3J1v2p2K160n2H06/pete5.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pete Hunt, CEO @ Smyte. OG React.js. Ex-Facebook and Instagram&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/react&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; is now one of the most popular JavaScript UI libraries in the world. It has over 70K stars on GitHub, over 1100 contributors, over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/react&quot;&gt;6M downloads&lt;/a&gt; this past month alone, and well over &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/react/in-stacks&quot;&gt;4K company stacks&lt;/a&gt;. But when Facebook first introduced React to the world, not too many people cared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the latest episode of Stack Stories, we did something a bit different. We decided to focus on the origin story of the one of the most popular technologies in the software development world: &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/react&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt;. We sat down with Pete Hunt, one of the original creators of React, now CEO at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smyte.com/&quot;&gt;Smyte&lt;/a&gt;, to get the untold, in-depth story of why React was first created, how it gained adoption within Facebook due to the Instagram acquisition, and it's eventual release to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to the interview in full or check out the transcript below (edited for brevity).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highlights&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/posts/the-react-story#the-one-man-facebook-video-team&quot;&gt;The One Man Facebook Video Team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it became like the number three most popular video site in the world or something. It was this hackathon project that was barely maintained, so I was like the one guy at the company that was maintaining this thing. This was back before Facebook Live was a priority or any of that stuff...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/posts/the-react-story#instagram-acquisition&quot;&gt;From Facebook Camera App To Instagram Acquisition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;26.933333333333&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuck gets everybody together and is like, “Hey mobile is going to be a big deal and we are dropping everything and moving tons and tons of resources to mobile.”...I was like, “We can’t maintain the largest photo site in the world with a handful of people, this is crazy guys. We’re putting all these people into iOS and Android for apps that make up a minuscule amount of our traffic this doesn’t make any sense.” Turns out that it was 100% the right thing to do, that’s why I was not CEO of Facebook...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had this app that we built and we were really proud of called Facebook Camera... We worked really hard on it, I wasn’t working directly on it, I was supporting it from the server side but we had a bunch of really talented engineers working on it and tons of designers. Instagram just came in and ate its lunch...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Instagram they gave them a garage in the Facebook campus where they could just do their own thing. They took advantage of the Facebook kind of trusted safety systems, but other than that, they continued to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/amazon-ec2&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt;, they continued to draft their own product strategy from what I could tell...I was the first one to go full time over there to Instagram when that happened...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/posts/the-react-story#instagram-web-presence&quot;&gt;Instagram Needs A Web Presence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;37.017048794827&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had photo pages and the web was a bit of a strategic thing for them, so they were mobile first, Instagram has always been mobile first. Instagram actually, a lot of the content is public and, I think SEO was an important thing for them...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were using &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/amazon-ec2&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt; and all the cloud computing stuff that you are used to, all off the shelf &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/django&quot;&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt; run on &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/amazon-ec2&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt; talking to &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/postgresql&quot;&gt;Postgres&lt;/a&gt;, pretty different software stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...You couldn’t see all the photos somebody has uploaded or anything. We wanted to fix that but we had this problem where if you are, this goes back into the stack, but we had these application servers that were &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/django&quot;&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt; and we had these database servers which were &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/postgresql&quot;&gt;Postgres&lt;/a&gt; and Postgres can only support a certain number of connections...we can’t add any more load to the servers, and serving a bunch of dynamic web pages actually does add a bunch of load to the servers, especially when it’s going to be exposed in the public web. We decided we had to do client rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to the front end engineering team at Facebook called UIE...I was like, “Hey we need a JavaScript framework what should we use?” They were like, “Well we’ve got these three or four experimental things that we have baking right now. We have BoltJS, we have JSHTML and then we have this &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/react&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; thing.”...I took a look at all of them and I talked to the people working on them and decided to try out &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/react&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instagram was kind of the future in terms of tech stacks at least relative to Facebook, and I was bridging the Facebook world and the Instagram world. I saw that Facebook is five years in the future in one direction and Instagram is in the present but kind of in a slightly different direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/posts/the-react-story#react-gains-adoption-within-facebook&quot;&gt;React Gains Adoption Within Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;29&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ads team is some of the strongest front end engineers out there and they came to me and they were like, “Hey how was your experience building with React,” and I told them. I said, “Hey I’m a huge fan I don’t want to use any other framework other than this thing.”...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guy that actually originally came up with idea for React, Jordan Walke, came from the ads team. He was like, &quot;making a change on this product is terrifying, like potentially lose a day of revenue because you’ve missed a semicolon or something.&quot; He had felt the ads pain and then he convinced them after building this thing on nights and weekends to work on it full time for a little while. As he was working on this framework full time he built a type ahead component and had rolled that out I think in maybe a little News Feed unit but never a full application. Instagram was like the first full application...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Ads says, “Worked on that News Feed thing, worked on the Instagram thing, we’ll try it on ads.” Mobile search said, “Hey it worked on that News Feed thing, it worked on that Instagram thing and I hear that ads is going to try it,” and then they keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/posts/the-react-story#open-sourcing-react&quot;&gt;Open Sourcing React&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;25.849517684887&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were really excited back at Facebook because we had been writing documentation, getting it ready and it was early morning for us because we were on the West Coast and the tweets started to roll in that were all like, “Facebook is terrible, this is the worst idea I have ever seen.”...We were like, “they’ll love this” and we didn’t realize that like that’s not how the rest of the world thought... Nobody used it and it was just kind of like a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then JSConf EU was later that year...I wrote this talk and I was like, “I’m not going to try to convince you that React is better. I’m just going to tell you why it’s different and these are the three or four things that nobody has tried before.” That was a lot more; people were a lot more receptive to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that is often overlooked about React when you think about stability, within Facebook there are, I don’t work there anymore but when I left there were tens of thousands of React components which probably translates to hundreds of thousands of lines of code. Whenever React wants to make a breaking change, they can’t tell other people to re-factor their code. They have to re-factor those hundreds of thousands of lines of code themselves... React team has to do it all. What that means is that it has to be automatable with some sort of script and those scripts are shared with the community and that’s why you don’t get an &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/angular-2&quot;&gt;Angular 2&lt;/a&gt; scenario with React because the people paying the price are the people actually making the breaking changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/posts/the-react-story#reflections-and-whats-next&quot;&gt;Reflections and What's Next For React&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I wanted to do was I wanted to have a React team certified badge where we say, “Hey, we are blessing this third party library and we say this is the right thing to do.”...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiber just started passing all of its tests recently and that’s a really cool project. It does bring a lot of really interesting concepts so that’s really cool. I think the React VR announcement was really interesting. If you think about all the different platforms you can target with React Native or with React, there is iOS, Android, web, VR now...That’s really cool because you teach these engineers how to write a little JavaScript and the basics of React and then you just give them API documentation for all these platforms and they can go and move really quickly. That’s really cool, that’s stuff that I’m really excited to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yonas: All right welcome. Pete do you want to introduce yourself?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete: Yeah I’m Pete Hunt formerly of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/react&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; team at &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/facebook&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; a long time ago. Over the past two, two and a half years I’ve been CEO and co-founder of a company called &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/smyte&quot;&gt;Smyte&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grew up north of Boston and amongst many, many Red Sox fans which turned me into a fan of kind of anybody who plays against the Red Sox basically. If you ever met any Boston fans you know what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to college in upstate New York and then basically went straight from my graduate program to Facebook in at the end of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: When you first got there what team did you join and what was the set up for what you were working on?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: I got my master’s in computer science and I focused on distributed systems and I was really excited about building the next distributed database, because this was back when databases were a really, really cool technology. There were all these new database startups coming out. I thought caching was really cool and distributed consensus and all that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I joined Facebook and I was thinking, “All right okay I’m going to work in search infrastructure, memcache,” there is this thing called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/tao-the-power-of-the-graph/10151525983993920/&quot;&gt;TAO&lt;/a&gt; which is their distributed graph database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens at Facebook is they put you into this bootcamp program where the first six weeks I don’t know if it’s changed since then, but back then it was the first six weeks. You go work on a little bit of everything so you are given; a front end task, a back end task, an infrastructure task, a mobile task and all over the stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I had to work on was the embeddable comments widget that you see on TechCrunch and other blogs that you can put Facebook comments in there. The task was like send a notification to the blog owner when somebody makes a comment and there was some condition associated with it. I wrote the code, got the code code reviewed the tests pass and it rolls out on a Tuesday. Then two or three hours after it rolls out TechCrunch posts this thing that’s just like, “What the hell happened to Facebook notifications.” Because this thing had a bug in it where it sent all the owners of these blogs like thousands of notifications in like a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Ouch. It was your first bug!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: This is like my third week on the job or something right and I’m like, “Wow my work made it into TechCrunch that’s awesome.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Congrats man that’s huge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Thanks. They rolled it back there were like no permanent problems from that or anything and it’s, I think any tech company these days doesn’t hold bugs against the engineers at least the ones that people want to work for. That was a super positive experience; I ended up really liking the idea of working on user facing products. I ended up joining the Facebook video team and that was one person so I was the second person on that, the first person moved on so I was like the Facebook videos team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: The Facebook video man.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah basically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Wait, one person? So this is like way before videos is even a thing on Facebook.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: This was like, you know we were talking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/react-native&quot;&gt;React Native&lt;/a&gt; before we started recording and Charlie Cheever started &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/expo&quot;&gt;Expo&lt;/a&gt;. Two years before I joined Facebook his hackathon project was, “Hey you should be able to upload videos to Facebook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Duh!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah, right? I think it became like the number three most popular video site in the world or something. It was this hackathon project that was barely maintained, so I was like the one guy at the company that was maintaining this thing. This was back before Facebook Live was a priority or any of that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: He had built, so Charlie had built the first version of videos and then you were tasked with taking that on.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: There were a couple of people that had hacked on it but I saw his name all over the codebase. There were a couple of other kind of old timers that had built that. It was one of these things that was, it was like a hackathon project and it was never a strategic priority while I was there so I was just like the one person that was keeping the lights on making sure that everything was working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the third largest video site in the world or something. They put this like… 23 year old kid who sends thousands of notifications to blog owners to like maintain this thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was cool, I don’t know if it was a good idea but it was cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Did you make any like, any big bugs make it into the video product?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: It was like … I was really into &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/python&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; in college that was a pretty cool – While I was in college again like &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/rails&quot;&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt; had just become popular, so python was kind of riding that wave too. I was really excited about Python and kind of looked down on &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/php&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/a&gt; programmers. During my tenure on Facebook video I took all the Python code that they had written and ported it into PHP because we wanted one codebase in one language. It was kind of just like …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: We as in yeah, like everybody like as part of engineering wanted it. Did you want that or were you just like, “Oh man?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: I mean back then I didn’t have the experience I have now so I was like, “Python is cool and PHP is for losers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I appreciated having one language but I didn’t realize that for all intents and purposes it didn’t matter what language you use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Got you. At that point Hack/HHVM all that was already a thing right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: That was when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HipHop_for_PHP&quot;&gt;HPHP&lt;/a&gt; had just finished, so they had just rolled out the last web servers on HPHP which basically takes regular old PHP and compiled it to C++. If you are familiar with all these transpilers in the JavaScript world, well it’s all the same thing, but server side you transpile from PHP to C++. The guy who wrote that saved the company some ridiculous amount of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean just making single digit percentage points gains in efficiency at that scale is a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: For sure, wow interesting. So, video was like your big project and then did you go directly into photos or how did photos come into the mix?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: So, because it was a team of one it was kind of org’d or it was org’d under the photos team. We had the photos and videos team, I worked on video and almost exclusively video and then my manager managed me and then the four people or five people working on photos. Again, largest photo sharing site in the world had like four or five people working on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: How many people were at the company at this point?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: I think it was under 2,000. Facebook engineering was I want to say like 600 people. Remember, a lot of that went into infrastructure, this was, Facebook was started before the cloud was a thing so they had to run their own data centers and do all that stuff. That’s, a lot of the headcount was tied up in various infrastructure related stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: That would be a good thing to focus on, cloud...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: I was just thinking like what would Facebook’s engineering, what would that have looked like had the cloud already been a thing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah, it’s really interesting. The …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: We could probably spend like hours talking about that but yeah.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Hey if you want to make two podcasts today, I’m into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing, I don’t know if this is just something I read in a blog post somewhere or if this is like common knowledge. Some people say that the Facebook’s and Google’s of the world are like five years ahead of open source and companies that can’t throw zillions of dollars at engineers. When I joined I remember this vividly I think it was 2011 or maybe 2012 I gave this tech talk on this thing called Tupperware and it was using this thing called Linux Containers. I didn’t really understand what that was because I wasn’t super knowledgeable about the actual kind of devops side of things. That’s basically Facebook’s version of Docker and this was back in 2011. They had built that and Google I know had their own containerized thing that they had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Docker came out I think it was 2013 is when it started getting really popular, 2014. I think that one change that would happen today is that rather than invent your own container orchestration they would just use &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/docker&quot;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; and probably something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/kubernetes&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Got you yeah, no that seems like an obvious one. I think it was Heroku who had also been using Linux Containers and the obvious choice would have been Docker in orchestration there. But, yeah that’s interesting, do you think that … Out of the 600, I guess we can use that as a proxy, out of the 600 engineers how many would you say at that point were working on infrastructure versus application code?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Oh man that’s a hard question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Ballpark. I mean one person on video, I mean that’s kind of crazy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Remember though at the time there was a whole effort for Timeline, so Timeline was like the big, one of the couple of big projects that was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Timeline, I remember Timeline yeah.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: That sucked up a lot of talent on the front end engineering side. You are building this infinitely scrolling timeline user interface that’s got to work in IE6 or something that takes a lot of resources. On the infrastructure side you need to have a back end that lets people skip from the current year to what they did five years ago. A lot of times you’d put that data more in a cold storage and how do you deliver a user experience that lets you load that fast enough. I would just, I’m just making up a number here but I would say it felt like two thirds of the company was infrastructure and one third of the company, or of engineering, was front end or product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Now that’s huge right because then that could have gone, that could have flipped the other way like one third to infrastructure let’s say if the cloud had already been a thing and you guys weren’t building out your data center. That could probably be a whole separate podcast but it’s so interesting, so the photos team, I guess we can probably get into the React stuff now. Photos - what was that like; were there any like big challenges that you can remember when you were first getting ramped up in video and photos that you remember?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah. I joined to work on video and it was kind of in maintenance mode and so one of the problems that video had was every Sunday morning the encode queue would get backed up and I would get paged and I would have to restart the encode servers. We fixed that by again like throwing out a bunch of Python code and rewriting it in PHP and the nature of the company at the time was like people would change teams really often. They would actually try to get you to change teams after a year to try to spread knowledge around the company or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photos team started to turnover and I interfaced with them a lot so I ended up having to pick up the slack on some of the photos tasks. Before I really knew what was happening I was the longest tenured person on the photos team and it happened really quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then … There was a couple of things going on; there was Timeline that was going on and that timeline involved a bunch of search and stuff like that. Another big thing that was going on was the shift to mobile, so I joined and then it was a couple of months after I joined, Zuck gets everybody together and is like, “Hey mobile is going to be a big deal and we are dropping everything and moving tons and tons of resources to mobile.” A lot of people were pulled off of the web teams and put on mobile, which pissed me off because I didn’t have an appreciation. I didn’t have a smartphone, so I didn’t have like an appreciation for mobile. This was like 2011; you know what I had just gotten my first smartphone, that’s what it was, when I graduated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was like, “We can’t maintain the largest photo site in the world with a handful of people, this is crazy guys. We’re putting all these people into iOS and Android for apps that make up a minuscule amount of our traffic this doesn’t make any sense.” Turns out that it was 100% the right thing to do, that’s why I was not CEO of Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Yeah it was a good bet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah it was definitely a good bet. The kind of people that had been around for a while were being pulled on the mobile teams, which created opportunities for the less tenured people at Facebook to step up and own products and own pieces of the infrastructure. So that by the time we acquired &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/instagram&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; they were like, “Hey we need a senior-ish person on the photos team to go over there and build out their web stuff, integrate them, help them get integrated into Facebook engineering. Kind of welcome them and plug them into the right stuff.” I was one of the people that was, I was the first one to go full time over there to Instagram when that happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Got you okay. What was that like? You read about it then you were like, “Whoa this is cool,” or what were you thinking at the time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Well, you know again we had, I was on Facebook photos we had this big initiative to move to mobile. We had this app that we built and we were really proud of called Facebook Camera. It was …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: I don’t even remember that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah that’s this, that comes into the story. We worked really hard on it, I wasn’t working directly on it, I was supporting it from the server side but we had a bunch of really talented engineers working on it and tons of designers. Instagram just came in and ate its lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Wait I do remember that app, it was all photos and then you were supposed to like stuff but the whole screen was the photo or something.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah and we went back and forth in that design decision for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Yeah I do remember that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah so we launched that app. My read of the situation, again I don’t remember everything 100% accurately or anything, but we spent a really long time trying to figure out the exact gestures that we were going to do and all sorts of really, really nuanced UI things. The Facebook ethos at the time was unashamedly move fast and break things and I was like, “Guys this is not move fast and break things. This is like pause, pause, pause and miss the market.” That may or may not explain what happened, it kind of felt like it was ready to launch for a long time it just was people couldn’t agree that the design was right. Anyway it did launch, Instagram made its launch. We considered them like these fierce competitors and like, you can see my first photo on my current Instagram account is when I worked at Facebook and took a photo of my desk trying to figure out why do people like this app? I’m trying to figure out, all that kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Right, you still weren’t convinced that mobile was the future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah, I’m still trying to figure it out you know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then one day we get this or one evening we got this email it’s like, “Hey guys come in early to work tomorrow we got a big announcement.” Then we come in early and he is like, “Yeah you know in an hour they’re going to report that we acquired Instagram and they are coming in this afternoon and go shake their hands.” I was like whoa like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: All six of them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah. Like they are our sworn enemies and now we’ve got to be friends with them... great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Right. Yeah it was like six people though right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: It was 14 I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Oops.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: No, it was actually, but depending on whether you count when they announced the acquisition or when it actually closed because they hired people in between those two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Got you, okay interesting. 14 people walked into the office.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah, I think it was like 14 people. There is a photo somewhere that I could go and count the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Yeah I’m sure. Okay, so then at some level you must have been like, “Oh well this is good now we have like a way to do photos and we don’t need to spend weeks figuring out gestures and stuff.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: I don’t know I liked …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: You liked Facebook Camera?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Well I wouldn’t say I liked Facebook Camera. I wanted, I bled the blue and I wanted our company to win and it didn’t feel like we won...turns out we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Yeah, that’s a huge W right there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: It was a little weird when they showed up for me anyway and then they worked … What was cool is I think that some of the really successful tech acquisitions that have happened - think like YouTube and Instagram - those are the two that stick out for me. You kind of leave them alone, you say, “Hey we’ve got all these resources, take advantage of the resources you want but we’re not going to tell you how to run your product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Instagram they gave them a garage in the Facebook campus where they could just do their own thing. They took advantage of the Facebook kind of trusted safety systems, but other than that, they continued to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/amazon-ec2&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt;, they continued to draft their own product strategy from what I could tell. It was really interesting how hands-off it appeared at least. I wasn’t in the conversations with Mark or the executive team or anything, but as kind of an engineer, it seemed like they just could do what they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Then how did the transition happen when you got pulled on to Instagram?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: They needed a web presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: They had no website at the time.?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: They had photo pages and the web was a bit of a strategic thing for them, so they were mobile first, Instagram has always been mobile first. Instagram actually, a lot of the content is public and, I think SEO was an important thing for them...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Really?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah, you search for like Justin Bieber you want the Instagram link to be up at the top right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Yeah. Yeah.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: I think that was the strategic reason why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Yeah I can see the head of Instagram saying, “Look desktop is going to be a big thing let’s go after it.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: That’s what was weird because it flipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Yeah exactly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Everything went mobile first and then we would think about like, “Okay what’s the desktop angle or the mobile web angle.” SEO was kind of a justification I think for what we were doing, so my main …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: You were the guy. You were the desktop photos guy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: That’s right so my manager was like, “Hey you’ve been around the team for a while - you interested in making the change? We are spinning up this new team on the Instagram side to build out all the Instagram web stuff,” and he was like, “You should go,” and I was like, “All right, I’ll do it. I’m on that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Nice all right.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: That was being, I was the first full time engineer to go over to Instagram. From the Facebook side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was like the corporate drone being dropped into a new startup... the corporate drone from like Facebook, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No they didn’t make, it’s not like they made me feel that way or anything. They were all super nice and cool, they did things very differently than Facebook so, code review was largely optional. They did continuous deployment which I thought was totally crazy, Facebook would deploy on Tuesdays at 2 p.m. and if you didn’t get your changes in they weren’t going out that week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Okay so yeah it was a startup essentially, they were still just operating as kind of like a startup.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: They were using &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/amazon-ec2&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt; and all the cloud computing stuff that you are used to, they were using &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/django&quot;&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt; rather than the Facebook home built … At that point it was like a home built framework and a home built language at Facebook scale and on Instagram it’s all off the shelf Django run on AWS talking to &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/postgresql&quot;&gt;Postgres&lt;/a&gt;, pretty different software stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: It’s funny because that’s of the perfect representation of what has happened in the past few years and the reason that StackShare even exists is, these days you're not building all that stuff for yourself. You are not rolling your own framework so that’s the perfect example.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah I mean our company we started two and a half years ago, we process a lot of data, like hundreds of millions monthly actives type of data and it’s event data too so the volume is really high. We have four people working full time on infrastructure. It’s crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: It’s like the opposite.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it’s pretty cool all the technology that’s come out recently that lets you just manage all that. But anyway...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: That’s awesome though, so you get into the Instagram world; everyone is deploying code, slinging code to production, no code reviews...interesting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: They had some code review but it was optional. There were a couple of people, I remember there being like three engineers that knew how everything worked and they could just roll out anything they wanted and it was totally fine. The newer guys like me, we would want our code to be reviewed, we didn’t want to take down the site. One thing that they did have it was basically like everything was really, really well tested so if the tests were green you were okay to roll out and the tests were really, really thorough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Man so interesting, I definitely want to hear about this stack, but let’s try to keep it focused. When you got there, there was no front end framework being used?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: So let’s rewind for a second. We had to build this, what we thought were going to be a pretty comprehensive set of web apps. Like we were going to start with profile pages and photo pages and then we were going to build hash tag pages, maps like geographic search and stuff like that, all for the Instagram web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: What existed is the single photos, the single photo pages?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah, there was a photo page and then there was instagram.com which was like a billboard for the app. That’s all that they had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Got you yeah, I remember that actually, but you could only see a photo.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah and you couldn’t see all the photos somebody has uploaded or anything. We wanted to fix that but we had this problem where if you are, this goes back into the stack, but we had these application servers that were &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/django&quot;&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt; and we had these database servers which were &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/postgresql&quot;&gt;Postgres&lt;/a&gt; and Postgres can only support a certain number of connections. The constraint was – and we were at that max limit - the constraint was we can’t add any more load to the servers, and creating a bunch, serving a bunch of dynamic web pages actually does add a bunch of load to the servers, especially when it’s going to be exposed in the public web. We decided we had to do client rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: What about caching?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: They were really good about caching and I don’t actually know if, like looking back on this the way I would have done it now is be like, “Hey we are going to server render it and we are just going to cache it.” I don’t actually remember if there were other reasons why we decided that we had to client render it. I remember I was basically told like, “Hey I think we need to client render this.” There was a prototype that was going on that was client rendered so we decided to go … Oh yeah, because eventually we were thinking those pages would be personalized, so if you are logged in, you look at the same profile page it looks different to both for us. Which is like Facebook for example... you can’t cache any full page because everybody’s page is personalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Okay so you were doing it with that in mind?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: That’s what it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Okay got you. You needed to client render and none of that was, had been rolled out or anything at that point?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: We had no client rendering. It was a small prototype of jQuery-Mustache templates which was kind of the, the designer had hacked something up with a certain engineer over there and they were like, “Hey you know this is a prototype. Hey Facebook engineer, go like production-ize this and get it rolled out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Facebook drone, execute!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: No. They were super cool, I love those guys. We had to client render; I actually didn’t know &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/javascript&quot;&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Wow.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Facebook largely doesn’t, they don’t want engineers to write &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/javascript&quot;&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; because it adds to the download, so it increases … It’s more CPU utilization and it’s another language to learn, it’s more code to download, it’s more work, so there is a little bit of JavaScript that’s reused all over the place on Facebook. I kind of knew JavaScript but not really. I went to the front end engineering team at Facebook called UIE. User Interface Engineering, I was like, “Hey we need a JavaScript framework what should we use?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were like, “Well we’ve got these three or four experimental things that we have baking right now. We have BoltJS, we have JS HTML and then we have this &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/react&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; thing.” There were pilot projects for all of them, there might have been something else too but … because I remember I think Facebook had acquired the WebOS guys and they were really good and they had built something. We had a mobile web framework called Javelin so there was a bunch of different options. I took a look at all of them and I talked to the people working on them and decided to try out &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/react&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; and so-.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: What drove you to do that? What about the other options did you just like the name or?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: So everyone has got their “hello world” and if you’ve worked on other ways of rendering client side apps before and then you see React, it’s like almost too good to be true. You are like, “How does that work? There is no way that that works and if it works it must be really slow.” It took me, like Jordan worked with me a lot and he had written a lot of really interesting hello world, not hello world but like quick starts for various types of things. We had prototyped the profile page in React and it was a pretty positive experience, the end result was really positive. It was fast, it worked really well, didn’t have too many bugs because it’s getting rid of all the mutable state is a good thing. We launched it and it was really successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Which profile page?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: The Instagram profile page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Okay so a user’s profile page. You basically, okay whoa that’s quick. You saw React you were like, “This looks really cool,” and then you just started to build out the profile page with that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah, but there is a lot of blood, sweat, and tears in between like let’s try React, and let’s put something into production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Okay all right cool, let’s talk about that because that sounds pretty quick it’s like, “Oh this seems cool...BOOM , it’s live for everyone.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: I think if there is one, like reflecting on this, if there is one big theme it’s that Instagram was kind of the future in terms of tech stacks at least relative to Facebook, and I was bridging the Facebook world and the Instagram world. I saw that Facebook is five years in the future in one direction and Instagram is in the present but kind of in a slightly different direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some things that Facebook did really, really well and better than anybody else, there were other things that they would have just used a cloud service for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good example was all the Facebook JavaScript, React included, was packaged using their homegrown bundler which was really, really advanced it used some machine learning or statistical thing that looks at the logs of people downloading individual modules and the dependency graph and will do an optimization on what modules are we going to bundle together and what are you going to have to download up front versus lazily and all sorts of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written by this PhD, super super crazy, it’s awesome, it’s better than &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/webpack&quot;&gt;Webpack&lt;/a&gt;, it’s better than anything that’s out in open source still, but it’s very, very much tied to Facebook’s infrastructure. The module system - we had these comments in the JavaScript that was @ require and the module name and it would show up as a magical global - so we had to take that and somehow bring the React dependency into Instagram. The first thing I did was I wrote a Python script that would translate that weird syntax; it was a bunch of just gnarly regular expressions to &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/requirejs&quot;&gt;RequireJS&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t know if you guys remember RequireJS?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD modules, so we did that. That was enough I think to get us to production, so I ran the script once, committed the generated code to git and then we set up a little RequireJS integration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/django&quot;&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt; and then we shipped it. As we started to pull over, build more products, we wanted to use analytics so we wanted to use Facebook's analytics stack so we had to pull over more of those modules and then that script got bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I moved to management and I got a team of three or four engineers that were helping to build out all this stuff, and we wanted to build this whole suite of business products. By this point we were pretty happy with React and we knew that, we were going to go all in on it and we …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: You are talking about Instagram?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: I’m talking about Instagram, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Interesting yeah. In terms of where React was, you basically got it ready, you brought it into the Instagram environment or codebase and then you shipped it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: We shipped the profiles product, then we shipped - that went over pretty well - then we shipped a News Feed product so you can log in, see a feed, paginate. It had this one really cool subtle feature that I’m still really proud of where if you went somewhere and then clicked the back button it would cache where you were in the feed in the history API and it would also cache the data that you had downloaded. So it would bring you right back to where it was, which is super annoying if you ever use a product that doesn’t do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Facebook mobile... yeah, it’s super annoying but that’s awesome. For that initial launch it sounds like that went really well, you guys were happy with React. Was that an “aha moment” for you or were you just like, “Oh this is cool let’s continue to use it,” or did you have some inkling like, “Oh man this is going to be pretty big if we can continue to build out with React.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: There was a couple of things going on; the first was I thought the development experience was awesome. It was pretty different from how it looks today. Lee Byron came in a couple of months after we had shipped the first, the profile pages and he was like, “This API is unintelligible for the lifecycle hooks let’s,” -- because we had different hooks, totally different names for every lifecycle hook. We had some they called like “prop trigger” and another thing called like “on state changed” and another they were kind of like ad hoc names-- so he is the guy who came up with “component did mount, “component will mount” he kind of cribbed it from how iOS does things. It was totally a team effort and I cleaned up a lot of the API too and fixed some performance stuff and did all the packaging for Instagram then we just went and reused a lot of that for open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: So, in terms of the evolution it sounds like that was the proof of concept, “Okay this works.” By the way how many users were there on Instagram at that point?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: I forget, but I mean tens of millions at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Okay, so you knew it worked well at scale in a sense, and then from there did you start building everything else out immediately in React?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: If you look at it from the React point of view there were a couple of things going on. Yeah we were like this works great and then I get another PSD from our designer for a newsfeed and they are like, “Go build that.” Like, “All right got to go back to work and build that,” didn’t really reflect too much on the framework. I thought the framework was super super kick ass, I thought that it was really, really innovative, it was doing things in a way that had never been done before and I wanted to be a part of it. So I started contributing back to the code, the Facebook side code base just kind of in my spare time. As we would roll out new products I would fix bugs and clean up the API, write docs, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: On Instagram.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: On Instagram but those would make it back into React core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: It was open source from day one?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: No, this was all …You can think of Facebook internally open sourcing React to Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were the source of truth modules in the Facebook codebase and then we would periodically, we would just pick a git commit and then we would export it into Instagram when we wanted to take advantage of a new feature or something. It was always actually really painful to do that, because I had again this hacky script that would translate it to RequireJS and like maybe it broke or something and you’ve got to fix that and then you’ve got to, we didn’t have a lot of stability back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: It’s not like you are forking it right, you didn’t fork react the core.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: No, it was when we made changes it was always to the Facebook source of truth and then we would export that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Okay all right, so you were committing directly to the core repo?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: That’s right yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Got you interesting. You were making these changes okay basically it happened incrementally now you had to build the News Feed so obviously you are going to use React. Then what came after News Feed do you remember?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Then Facebook ads had to do client rendering too, they were rebuilding some critical ads product and they were looking, they were doing the same thing that I did a couple of months prior which was BoltJS, whatever their options were in React.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: By the way was Angular ever a thought?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: No, not even close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: When you guys were thinking about this it was always, “Let’s look at what’s already being used in the Facebook ecosystem or has been created inside of Facebook.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: It’s less about, I mean there is a little bit of NIH there, but there is good reason for it. Templates were never on the table. So a long time ago on the PHP side of the house they had this thing called XHP which is open source but nobody uses it. Where rather than having what passes for a template in PHP world, you build what’s called XHP elements which are components. They use this similar syntax to JSX, they have similar kind of lifecycles for loading data and server side they just spit out a string of HTML rather than DOM elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were like this is definitely the right way to build applications it wasn’t even up for debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All those the BoltJS and all these other things you build the apps in similar ways and components. What made React unique was how the components re-rendered, the other ones there would have been an initial render and then you would have to manually like update the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what I thought was, that’s what blew my mind. I like didn’t understand how that was possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have a really crisp explanation of this like, think of it as a Virtual DOM and you do a diff and the diff is fast. That was a really big pill to swallow back then. Remember we were pushing products on IE7 and 8 back then, so having that be fast enough I was like, “Yeah right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Right...wow that’s so interesting. It sounds like it was super organic and sorry you were saying the ads team was looking around at BoltJS and then they found React.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah and the ads team is some of the strongest front end engineers out there and they came to me and they were like, “Hey how was your experience building with React,” and I told them. I said, “Hey I’m a huge fan I don’t want to use any other framework other than this thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they did is they did some benchmarks. The UIE team internally had also done some benchmarks too and basically we all came to the same conclusion that was like, “Hey we all clearly obviously love the programming model and it turns out like it’s most likely going to be fast enough for the types of problems that we want to solve.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: It’s going to be fast enough not necessarily it’s going to be faster?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah fast enough. One of the big observations that I didn’t really appreciate until building something with React was usually it’s only a tiny percentage of your app that re-renders so the diffs normally aren’t actually that big. In the cases that the diffs are really big the alternative approach is to use data binding and the building up and tearing down of all those change listeners is really, really expensive. React in a lot of ways optimizes just for the initial render and sometimes at the expense of the incremental updates, because the incremental updates are pretty rare and pretty small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Got you, okay interesting. From the ad side of things why did they want to take on React? Were they experiencing issues... what were they using prior to that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Have you ever created an ad on Facebook?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Yes, once.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: It’s pretty hardcore. You are pulling in all these different demographic groups, they are spending money so you have to understand what locale a person is in. Yeah like if you are creating an ad in Israel like it’s got to work left or right or right to left. You want the preview of the ad unit to exactly match the actual ad unit, so you need a way to render it with the same code, but make it editable and a couple of edge cases when you are creating the ad versus rendering the ad. It’s got to be fast. If the button doesn’t save your change like you are going to spend money on something that isn’t what you wanted to buy, so it’s a very stressful thing to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guy that actually originally came up with idea for React, Jordan Walke, came from the ads team. He was like, &quot;making a change on this product is terrifying, like potentially lose a day of revenue because you’ve missed a semicolon or something.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had felt the ads pain and then he convinced - I don’t know how he did this - but he convinced them after building this thing on nights and weekends to work on it full time for a little while. As he was working on this framework full time he built a type ahead component and had rolled that out I think in maybe a little News Feed unit but never a full application. Instagram was like the first full application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: I was about to say so was React already being used at some level by ads or did they never...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: It wasn’t used by ads it was used a little tiny bit on News Feed. It was like 1% of News Feed users were getting this experiment that was the client-rendered comment box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Client rendered comment box okay so that was after Instagram or before?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: That happened just before Instagram. We knew like it will work on like IE7 or whatever it was that supported it back then. We knew that it would work we just didn’t know that it would work at the scale of a full page, with like a router and data fetching and all that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Got you. So basically React the inception was because of ads by Jordan so he built it as a side project they started to experiment with it in News Feed to client render comments for 1% or whatever of users, right? Then you basically saw that and said, “Looks good let’s start using it for Instagram profiles,” and then everything else just started happening?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Then Ads says, “Worked on that News Feed thing, worked on the Instagram thing, we’ll try it on ads.” Mobile search said, “Hey it worked on that News Feed thing, it worked on that Instagram thing and I hear that ads is going to try it,” and then they keep going. They kicked off something concurrently as well, so it really did kind of grow organically and it’s like everybody that used it got really passionate about it and excited about it and just started spreading it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Like wild fire.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah and it got to a point where, what’s called the product infrastructure team at Facebook which owns a lot of developer abstraction and stuff like that was like, “Guys, you are writing too much JavaScript. We know that React is really fun but you can use PHP once in a while to render this thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: That’s hilarious, they probably saw like a graph of JavaScript entering the code base.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah, you know like, “This has gone up way too fast; do you really need all of this JavaScript?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Got you, interesting okay. It was largely organic and then, but that’s a big bet to make on ads, because ads is the life blood of the entire company. I’m guessing they started with like 1% of 1% of ads and then just like looked at benchmarks and then eventually more and more ads.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah. Once that had happened, it was basically like the de facto way to build apps in JavaScript at Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like if you can prove it on ads and you can prove it ... It’s like if you can prove it on ads, then you’ve proven it across all the heavy weight UIs and then there is a second question which is like; is this thing going to work on mobile and we had benchmarks to prove that as far as JavaScript goes React is going to be fine on mobile. The greater question for Facebook was; how much client rendering do we want to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Yeah, okay so on the Instagram side because it sounds like Instagram is still the biggest user of React? Is that fair to say? Or once ads took over that was it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: I would say the ads codebase was probably bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Then they became like the biggest user of React before Instagram became all React everything?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Instagram was first. Instagram was all React but the surface area of the Instagram product is smaller than ads. We don’t deal with too much internationalization stuff or localization stuff. Like yeah we have to translate the strings, but we don’t need to know about different currencies. We don’t have to preview components within the components and stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Got you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: We had to deal with like performance, our biggest challenges were what does a React Router look like; so we built the first three React Routers ever. What does data fetching look like? Originally we were a React app that was plugged into Backbone and Backbone was doing all the data management on this. Yeah, that was actually the first profile page. The first profile pages were powered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/backbone&quot;&gt;Backbone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Wait, how did Backbone get there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: That prototype was &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/mustache&quot;&gt;Mustache&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/jquery&quot;&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt; and I forgot to say Backbone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're like, “Man we got to ship this thing,” so hack a script to like pull React in. We replaced the templates with the React components. We shipped it, we were like, “Well, that’s pretty good,” and then Jordan was like, “You know you don’t really need Backbone, it’ll be a lot faster and better if you don’t use Backbone.” Then we built the feed without Backbone and then we started to remove Backbone from the codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Got you. Then when did you run into basically state management and then need to actually build something for that or was that never, when did Redux and some of that stuff come into play?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah, state management... you got to think about it you know the second your app does anything interesting, anything changes in the UI. I was kind of like whenever I would face one of these problems, I would go to Jordan and I would be like, “Hey how should I solve this,” and then he would give me an answer and I would actually put it, like turn that into code and try to push that into production and be like, “Hey that doesn’t actually work like we got to make this changes, this change this, change the code base.” It was great because like he was kind of coming at it from the theoretical like this is how I think it should be, like drawing the state machine diagrams and stuff like that. I was hacking the shit out and actually trying to push to product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, at that point I didn’t need code review anymore in the JavaScript stuff. I was the guy that could do that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Yeah, got you. Right, you had to deal with that early on?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah, what ends up happening is you get like one controller component that has the state for 90% of the page and then you tediously kind of pass these props down all the way down to the bottom of your app. And we actually got pretty far with that, I think most people bail out too early on that approach because that approach has a lot of benefits. Like yeah it’s a lot more typing but you also know exactly what data your component is using and you know when it’s going to change and it’s really easy to debug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the flip side it’s a lot of typing and then sometimes your interface to your component doesn’t make a lot of sense. If you want to render the badge of the current user somewhere you’ve got to go look at your component hierarchy and pass the user all the way down which isn’t fun. So for Instagram we just powered through it, we didn’t use any sort of state management thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Okay got you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Ads used &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/flux&quot;&gt;Flux&lt;/a&gt;, the original Flux from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: OG Flux, okay.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah, the OG Flux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Actually OG means something different on Facebook but …&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah, the open graph tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: That’s funny, so you guys didn’t use any of that but ads needed it and they were just like, the way to go was to have something, something separate. Did they create Flux?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Sorry, Flux predates React, a lot of people don’t know that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flux came from the Facebook chat team. So the chat bar on Facebook and you type a message and you got to sync, there is like a little … The example they always use is that there is a little unread message count in the top bar and there is an unread message count in the bottom bar and you got to keep those in sync. It gets a little more hardcore because if you have multiple browser windows open you want to keep those in sync and …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, so Flux was already there and basically the approach a lot of teams took was, “Hey we are already using Flux we’re just going to swap out our manual DOM manipulation with React,” and that ended up working like pretty okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Right and then that became the standard- React and Flux?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah. It’s like people kept asking the question in open source like, “How do I deal with this problem?” I said, “Hey we have this thing called Flux it’s what we use, it wasn’t really designed for React but it works well enough.” That’s why you don’t often see people using the vanilla Facebook Flux Implementation, because it wasn’t really designed for React.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Right and is that one of the reasons that someone who was it, Dan, that created Redux?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah he wanted, he took … The main motivation was he wanted to do hot module reloading with Flux so you got this hot module reloading basically says, “Hey, you make a change, you save it. Then we're able to pause the state of the application load in the new code and resume and then re-render the page. It’s almost as you are typing and saving, your changes are showing up in real time. The problem is your state is stored in some variable somewhere and you have to get a reference to it and retain that. Swap out the old code swap in the new code and then put that reference back into the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redux was like, “Hey, how do I just make Flux work with this hot module reloading thing?” Then I think what happened is he just got a little carried away and ended up throwing out a lot of the bad ideas and bringing in a lot of good ideas and ended up with Redux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Got you, but Instagram wasn’t using either of those.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Okay, got you. Good stuff. When did the open source piece come into play and how did that decision even come about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah, I remember this because... I was super excited about React, there were other people at Facebook they were super excited. Like some of the names that you know now like Chris Chedeau, Tim Young, Jordan obviously, Sebastian and then they were some people internally that you don’t really remember. Like Michael Lowman’s was a designer on Instagram and he designed the original website and the logo that’s still used today. There are some other Instagram people that were involved a little behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were all really excited about it. I actually was talking with a startup about a CTO gig. Like leaving Facebook and being their CTO and they had millions of dollars in revenue and it was kind of enticing and I actually told them I was like, “Okay like I want to open source React, like hold off for like six months, I just want to do this thing.” I was, I’m saying that not to say how awesome I am, I’m saying that to say how excited I was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would have been a huge step up for me career wise. I was like, “No, I’m strapping myself to this React Rocket ship.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: React is the future.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah, we felt really, really passionate about it. Especially because remember this thing had been baked off by some of the best engineers I know against a bunch of competing solutions and we knew for a fact templates were the wrong way to do things. We knew for a fact that this Virtual DOM diffing thing which is kind of what we called it did work in the majority of cases that we tried it. For the ones that it didn’t there were escape patches that let you build 90% of your app with React and then 10% without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: How did the idea to open source even happen or come about? Were you just like, “Yeah, we need to release this and let everybody start using it,” or was it kind of just this standard like once you have something that works really well across products you start to think about open sourcing it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: We all kind of wanted to do it. I think there was some stuff going on back then that I wasn’t plugged into. I think that James Pearce was hired around then and I know that Tom Occhino was the kind of the main business driver behind a lot of this and Adam Wolf. I think Tom reported to Adam and Adam was a big advocate for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go back to that time, it was January 2013 or something like that, people hated Facebook, I mean the way that people talk about Uber today is like how people talked about Facebook. Just publicly, Social Network was still wearing off, the movie, and in the developer community Facebook IPO tanked if you remember that. I was around for that too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Facebook’s open source portfolio was like a bunch of projects they had thrown over the wall and abandoned. Famously there was this iOS library called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebookarchive/three20&quot;&gt;Three20&lt;/a&gt; that every iOS developer hated Facebook because they depended on this thing and then Facebook just stopped supporting it and that pissed a lot of people off. Open source wasn’t something Facebook was very good at, but I think when they hired James Pearce I think that happened at this time they were actively looking to reboot that. There also happened to be independent of that like a groundswell of support for open sourcing this React thing so the timing was pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were like, “Hey, we got to get this thing out.” There was a bunch of lawyering involved that I’m not going to get into that. We got it done and then we decide to announce it at JSConf 2013, I’m not sure if you guys remember that, but Facebook sponsors, the JSConfs and in exchange they get like a keynote spot or something. There is some sort of arrangement like that that happened. Already the sponsor keynote spots people are like a little “meh” about, the audience is kind of like, “The sponsor gets to speak to us... like... great.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Yeah Facebook.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah, also Facebook this evil mega corp that ruined open source and blah, blah, blah they’re speaking at JSConf. Then so Facebook goes up, Tom O. goes up and he is a really charismatic guy and he goes up with Jordan, who is the smartest engineer I have ever met. They are like, “Hey, we have a new way of building web applications. Everything that you are doing is wrong and here is how we do it.” At least that’s how it was interpreted and it’s like step one put XML in your JavaScript, inside your JavaScript it will be totally fine.” People were like XML whoa I hate XML and then they were like, “I thought I was supposed to separate my mark up from my JavaScript, from my styling and you are telling me to put all of that stuff into one file... I think this is too much.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he was doing the keynote and was announcing it and it’s called React, we pressed okay on the deploy button and we deployed the GitHub repo or we opened up the GitHub repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were really excited back at Facebook because we had been writing documentation, getting it ready and it was early morning for us because we were on the West Coast and the tweets started to roll in that were all like, “Facebook is terrible, this is the worst idea I have ever seen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: They just told me to throw out all my front end code.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah, well it wasn’t even that it’s like they don’t … It wasn’t even like, “Man, I have to throw out my code,” it’s like, “These guys are dumb, Facebook is stupid. Like they have been in their own little world for too long and they don’t know what they are doing and blah, blah, blah,” it was like sort of a bummer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: It’s safe to say people were not excited.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: No, they were excited to hate it and I believe that was the last conference that Jordan spoke at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: That’s like, that’s a ballsy move though, if you are going to launch a brand new framework when you do it at a conference where there is not a whole lot of anticipation that you are going to announce something big, so that’s huge. I mean hats off to you guys and the team right? That takes a lot of courage and you never know how people are going to React.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: I see what you did there. I was chalking it up to ignorance we were just like oh yeah people obviously understand that templates suck. Like components are clearly the way to do things and we know that everybody has felt the pain of having the separate mark up from your JavaScript driving it. We were like, “they’ll love this” and we didn’t realize that like that’s not how the rest of the world thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Yeah, that’s not how the real world works outside of the Facebook walls. So there wasn’t any real evidence that other companies or anyone else was going to use it right? It was just you guys saying, “We believe this is the future, here it is.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah pretty much. I felt really passionate about it being the future and remember we had already done the internal open sourcing from Facebook to Instagram and brought it into a foreign codebase. We knew that it was usable, which is a big problem with like a lot of these open source projects that are open sourced from an internal company things it’s like just completely unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Right that’s an important point.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: It’s really important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: It had already been used outside of ‘Facebook’ by Instagram so you had already dealt with some of those challenges. Okay, right that’s a good point.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah, so that was hugely beneficial and we had … Remember also we had ported it to RequireJS and I think right around the time we were open sourcing it we were migrating. We evaluated all these module bundlers to be able to get away from this terrible script and we decided to go with &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/webpack&quot;&gt;Webpack&lt;/a&gt; which was pretty unknown at the time so we …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: I didn’t know that you guys were like one of the first Webpack users.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah. I discovered Webpack, I’m going to take credit for that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Nice, okay Webpack has you to thank.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: I mean I didn’t write a single line of code or anything but it was our team actually did a big evaluation on a bunch of different bundlers. We looked at writing our own, we looked at &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/browserify&quot;&gt;Browserify&lt;/a&gt;, we looked at writing our own with browserify file components. We looked at, there was something modular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was Google Module Server I think was another one. There was a ton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code splitting is what, we needed code splitting. We are basically building out all these products and we didn’t want to have to download the profile page if we are on the photo page, because again the search engine optimization performance matters so we had to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Got you, okay. Webpack was being used when you open sourced React?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: We had maybe just finished moving over. I don’t actually remember the exact timing but like Webpack came in pretty soon after the Facebook or after the React open source if I remember it correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Got you, okay. So what do you think was the big driver behind everyone starting to adopt it, right? And what did that adoption look like from the inside looking out?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah, let me walk through how it got adopted. Everybody hated it at JSConf 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody used it and it was just kind of like a disaster. Well actually we had an IRC channel, a couple of people, if you know the Chang Lu and Ben Alpert both who now work for Facebook. They were these kind of people that stumble in the IRC and they were like, “Hey we really liked your JSConf video,” which we were like, “Really?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Thanks nobody else did, come work here!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: No, took years. We basically, anybody at that came in the IRC I was always in there, Chedeau was always in there so we would get notifications whenever anyone would join and we would welcome them and we would answer any questions like super, super quick. The first couple of people that came in the community were up and running pretty fast because of that support. Then JSConf EU was later that year and Tom O., I was sitting next to Tom O. at the time and he was like, “I don’t want to do this stupid conference talk,” because remember his last one was so fun and I was like, “I’ll do it!” And he was like, “All right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Nice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: I wrote this talk and I was like, “I’m not going to try to convince you that React is better. I’m just going to tell you why it’s different and these are the three or four things that nobody has tried before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Good job.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: That was a lot more; people were a lot more receptive to that. I was like, I don’t know if this is going to work. In reality we were pretty sure it was going to work but you can’t just come in and say, “Hey, we got a better solution that you should just do it this way.” You got to say, “Hey, here is the stuff that’s different,” and then you work your way to ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Just the diff yeah.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah, exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Nice, okay so your talk was a hit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah, talk was a hit. Ended up doing a lot more talks based on kind of the success of that one. We got, we talked to David Nolen who was the guy who made &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/clojurescript&quot;&gt;ClojureScript&lt;/a&gt;. He had been waiting for something like this and he wrote a really kind of famous blog post called; &lt;a href=&quot;http://swannodette.github.io/2013/12/17/the-future-of-javascript-mvcs&quot;&gt;the future of JavaScript MVCs&lt;/a&gt;. Where he talked about how great React was, that caused a really big step function increase in React’s popularity. Another thing that we did is that we had this wiki page of companies using React, so if any company had one tiny little project that was using React we would put their name there. This was …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Got you, I think this is pre-StackShare, when was that? What year was that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: That was 2013 …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Yeah, that was pre-StackShare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: … maybe the beginning of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Yeah, we always saw that and we are like, “Man that eventually needs to be on StackShare,” like just listing out all the customers. It’s powerful because that’s one of the first things you are evaluating is like, “Okay Facebook has used it obviously, but who else?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah the first question is like does it have any big users? Well, Facebook uses it. Okay, it’s like does anybody besides the authors use this because you don’t know if it works outside of Facebook use cases. That’s yeah like StackShare is obviously like a good idea like it’s been replicated on wikis how many times, yeah props to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Yeah, absolutely. It sounds like the wiki page was like part of the strategy, the marketing. I guess let me try to run through some of these questions from the community. Some of this we’ve touched on coming back to just like philosophies. One of the questions here is; “how did functional programming influence just the whole React philosophy of state props determining output?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah, so it’s, the way React works is very similar to how the web works; you get some data, you render a web page and you send it down the pipe and that’s conceptually how React works. This, I mean this was Jordan’s big insight and the answer is, yes, functional programming absolutely influenced React because V0 of React was written in OCaml, which is a functional programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Okay, interesting cool yeah. As far as React entering Facebook, we didn’t really get into that and how it like started to take on Facebook stuff outside of ads, but did it hinder or help collaboration on specific features? Do you have any insight into how it impacted the way that things were being built?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah, when we talk about the evaluations in bake-offs, it’s not just opening the profiler and seeing what the TTI is. It’s also taking a look at how the team is executing; is it easy to reuse code, is it easy to do code review and coordinate and how stable is it? When the core makes a change do we have to throw out all of our apps or can the core team re-factor everything for us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Okay, that’s upfront part of the evaluation is like does it make this easier or harder to work together?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: That’s right. Another thing that is often overlooked about React when you think about stability, within Facebook there are, I don’t work there anymore but when I left there were tens of thousands of React components which probably translates to hundreds of thousands of lines of code. Whenever React wants to make a breaking change, they can’t tell other people to re-factor their code. They have to re-factor those hundreds of thousands of lines of code themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Interesting, the React team has to do it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: React team has to do it all. What that means is that it has to be automatable with some sort of script and those scripts are shared with the community and that’s why you don’t get an &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/angular-2&quot;&gt;Angular 2&lt;/a&gt; scenario with React because the people paying the price are the people actually making the breaking changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: We didn’t really talk about server side rendering but do you want to touch on that? Was that after you had left?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: No, so server side rendering was one of those things that that was really cool. When I started using React one of the reasons why I got really excited about was I would go and ask Jordan I would be like, “Hey, can React do X?” He would be like, “Yeah, like it was designed to do that. Like render client side and server side, any mobile platform natively,” I just thought that was incredible and required a lot of foresight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing was when I joined, when I started working on React it’s like the server side rendering piece was more theoretical than it actually worked in practice. I had to build the API for it. Again, going back to the SEO thing we wanted to server render those photo pages so they could be crawled by Google, so I had learned &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/nodejs&quot;&gt;NodeJS&lt;/a&gt; for that and built the first server rendering API. In practice at Facebook I’m not sure how much traction it has. I know that there is a lot of companies that do depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was conceptually in React but there wasn’t … Basically what React does is it builds up a big markup string and then like puts it into the page. Well, that’s what it used to do, and there was no way of just building up that markup string. The first step was like, okay how do I get that markup string, and then I wrote an API for that and then rendered it in Node and we said “oh shit they are actually using like the window object or document dot something”. So we had to weed out all of those things, so then there was some branching in there and some abstraction, because as you add more contributors they weren’t thinking about that so we had to kind of roll back some of that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: If you could change one thing about React today what would it be and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah, that’s a great question. There are certain things that I always wanted to do that I just never got around to doing. I’ve actually never worked on React full time, I’ve always been working on a product or managing a team that was working on a product and like half-timing on React. When we launched this JavaScript Fatigue thing it was a big deal almost instantly. Like our answer, we didn’t have, we intentionally left a lot of kind of open questions for routing and data fetching and state management and styling and accessibility and internationalization all that stuff, like we didn’t have opinions about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I wanted to do was I wanted to have a React team certified badge where we say, “Hey, we are blessing this third party library and we say this is the right thing to do.” I just wanted to be very opinionated about that type of thing even if it, because the flip side of that right it’s like you might alienate somebody or you might stifle innovation in some ways and I get that and there has been a lot of innovation in the React community. I’m not saying it would have been better but that’s, I still feel like that would have been a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go on npm and there's like 40 different React type aheads right? How many of those get accessibility right? How of those get tab behavior right? How many of those are sufficiently styleable? How many of those mutate props God forbid? I was just thinking that people can submit to the React team, then the team goes and does a quick code review, and maybe there's a checklist of what we think or we check for, locales that kind of thing. Then we say, “Yes, this type ahead is good or passes this bar,” and we never did that. I think that there was an opportunity for somebody to do that. I’m not going to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Well, the other way to do that is to just say what are people doing. If I was asking that question, hopefully I'll go to the Smyte page and say, “All right, what's your stack profile,” and say, “Okay, let me see everything that Pete’s using.” That’s a roundabout way to do it without a coordinated effort to say, “Well what does Pete think is good?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah, that’s right. If you look at kind of the, if you are trying to figure out which of one of these 20 different type ahead packages I’m going to use, a lots of times you just go on... A lot of times they are not actually on StackShare, probably it should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they were I would go there but a lot of times it’s people go and look at the GitHub stars and the number of npm installs which if somebody has got a lot of Twitter followers or hits the front page of Hacker News by some roll of the dice that can throw that number off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Right, yeah. Yeah, no that’s an interesting project. Going back you would have created that from the beginning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah, I would have said, &quot;We think Webpack is the one true bundler.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: So the future; what do you think lies ahead for React? What are some of the things you are excited about? Maybe some of the things you are not excited about? You can include React Native in that but what do you think is going to happen with React and is there anything you are excited about or not?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Well, &lt;a href=&quot;http://isfiberreadyyet.com/&quot;&gt;Fiber&lt;/a&gt; just started passing all of its tests recently and that’s a really cool project. It does bring a lot of really interesting concepts so that’s really cool. I think the React VR announcement was really interesting. If you think about all the different platforms you can target with React Native or with React, there is iOS, Android, web, VR now. Somebody released a React renderer for Microsoft Word the other day. Which is not something you would normally think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s really cool because you teach these engineers how to write a little JavaScript and the basics of React and then you just give them API documentation for all these platforms and they can go and move really quickly. That’s really cool, that’s stuff that I’m really excited to see. I am sitting around waiting for the next release of the Native Windows and Mac UI toolkits because I bet they are going to look just like React. I’m waiting for the day when the only way that you build UI, the only way you can build UI is with the React paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Got you. Well, I guess yeah that kind of answers the question but what do you think about &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackshare.io/electron&quot;&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Man, you know I don’t know. I’ve got mixed opinions of it of like I get the program and productivity savings, but it is really heavy. We, I think that there is one thing that I would kind of change in the front end dev community in general is people use this kind of programmer or productivity savings as an excuse for, like you can justify like almost anything with that. I’m only adding five kilobytes to JavaScript or I’m only adding 50 milliseconds on this render pass, it’s not a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s premature optimization; guess what, optimization is premature. Like premature optimization it’s meaningless because it’s going to be repeat that 50 milliseconds 10 times and now you have half a second delay every time a component renders, right? React came on the scene and it was super, super fast because it was micro benchmarked, because it was micro optimized. Like did we have to do that event object pool thing? Probably not but nobody complained about garbage collection pauses when it came out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m saying that there are things that sound really true that are repeated all the time. Like premature optimization is one of those things where it sounds great, it sounds like, “Oh, you are thinking about the big picture,” but in reality you are adding latency to your app and you don’t have a … a lot of people don’t have a rubric for when is that okay and when is that not okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also like to follow people on Twitter that disagree with me or are from a totally different world of engineering. I follow like a lot of game programmers and like when something like Electron comes out or some use of JavaScript somewhere that they don’t like, they always just make fun of all JavaScript programmers. They are like, “Look at these morons,” blah, blah, blah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: JavaScript land, what a dump.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah and then the JavaScript people are like, “They are just a jerk and there is nothing true to what they are saying.” In reality there are big benefits to bring in a language that everybody knows to a new platform and building as much as you can in that platform. At the same time we burn so many CPU cycles that we don’t need to burn, delivering pretty basic UIs. I just think that you have to listen. Even if somebody is being a little offensive in the way that they like disagree with you, there still might be a kernel of truth to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Yeah interesting. One very important question; are you guys using React at Smyte?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yes we are. We are absolutely using it at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smyte.com/&quot;&gt;Smyte&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Do you want to tell people a little bit about Smyte? They will learn more in the coming weeks, hint hint.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah, so remember how I mentioned that when Instagram came over, they took advantage of some of these tools that Facebook had but we mostly left them alone, the one big one they took advantage of was Facebook Site Integrity System for catching bad guys. Fake accounts, compromised accounts, spam, harassment and I was just struck by how important that was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Smyte is trust and safety as a service so you plug your application into Smyte either your analytics stream with our API. We’ll analyze it for bad behavior, this can be; spam, harassment, buyer side fraud. Like if you ever bought an apartment on Craigslist or rented an apartment on Craigslist you know that there are some deals that are too good to be true. We try to find that stuff on market places, fake credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we work with a lot of marketplaces and we try to find fake inventory, so those are often deals that are too good to be true. Sometimes they are terms of service violations, so every marketplace, the instant it gets started. People post drugs for sale and some of them, some market places don’t want it so. It's a really interesting problem it’s a text classification problem, it’s a user behavior classification problem, it’s an image classification problem all kind of rolled up into one really interesting product I think. It’s been really fun doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been really fun building on all sorts of new, like it’s mostly infrastructure, we do have UIs that are built with React but I think the really interesting problems are the infrastructure and being able to scale up to all these hundreds and millions of monthly actives with an infra team of four people, that’s pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Amazing. if you think about it, that was one the big stories about Instagram was like they were able to do it with five, six engineers all writing application code and they weren’t worrying about the plumbing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: With Kubernetes the math is getting even more crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: With Smyte so you guys are powering some pretty massive sites right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah, I mean we work with a bunch of market places like GoFundMe and Indiegogo and YouCaring. Social Apps like Quora and musical.ly, Task Rabbit yeah. If you think about like any sort of peer to peer application and two sided application they are built on the idea of their users trusting them and that it is a safe place to interact with people, a safe place to transact. In order to do that you need lot of automatic analysis as well as kind of a nice human element to understand those kind of gray area cases so that’s what we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Yeah, no that’s awesome. Well, one thing that came to mind was that you being such a strong believer in React the natural assumption would be like you are going to go build something around React. What inspired you to start Smyte and how did that even come about? Did you go straight from Facebook to Smyte?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah, as soon as my, as soon as I handed in my gun and badge at Facebook I went and I bought a new computer and started writing code for Smyte. But the idea, you know kind of going back to what we were talking about earlier, to think of Facebook as being kind of five years ahead of everybody else their approach to trust and safety is something that will be useful for other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw this thing it was really, really valuable and important. I was like, “Okay, you shouldn’t have to sell your company in order to solve this problem.” That’s why we started Smyte to go and try to help out the companies that aren’t Facebook and can’t afford to get an army of engineers and a million servers to solve this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Awesome man this is amazing, thanks for taking the time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: Yeah, thanks for having me.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Scaling Postgres with Read Replicas and Using WAL to Counter Stale Reads</title>
<link>https://brandur.org/postgres-reads</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://brandur.org/postgres-reads</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A common technique when running applications powered by relational databases like Postgres, MySQL, and SQL Server is offloading read operations to readonly replicas , helping to distribute load between more nodes in the system by re-routing queries that don’t need to run on the primary. These databases are traditionally single master, so writes have to go to the primary that’s leading the cluster, but reads can go to any replica as long as it’s reasonably current.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spreading load across more servers is good, and the pattern shows itself to be even more useful when considering that although write operations might be numerous, most of them have predictable performance – they’re often inserting, updating, or deleting just a single record. Reads on the other hand are often more elaborate, and by extension, more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brandur.org/assets/postgres-reads/replica-reads.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-rjs=&quot;2&quot; src=&quot;https://brandur.org/assets/postgres-reads/replica-reads.svg&quot; class=&quot;overflowing&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Writes on the primary and reads on its replicas.
&lt;p&gt;Even as part of a normal application’s workload (barring analytical queries that can be even more complex), we might join on two or three different tables in order to perform an eager load, or even just have to read out a few dozen rows to accurately render a response. A mature application might execute hundreds of queries to fulfill even a single request, and farming these out to replicas would yield huge benefits in reducing pressure on the primary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running reads on replicas is a pretty good high-impact and low-effort win for scalability, but it’s not without its challenges. The technique introduces the possibility of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;stale reads&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that occur when an application reads from replica before that replica has received relevant updates that have been committed to the primary. A user might update some key details, and then go to view their changes and see stale data representing the pre-update state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brandur.org/assets/postgres-reads/stale-read.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-rjs=&quot;2&quot; src=&quot;https://brandur.org/assets/postgres-reads/stale-read.svg&quot; class=&quot;overflowing&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
A stale read that went to a replica that hadn't yet applied changes from the primary.
&lt;p&gt;Stale reads are a race condition. Modern databases operating over low latency connections can keep replicas trailing their primary &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; closely, and probably spend most of their time less than a second out of date. Even systems using read replicas without any techniques for mitigating stale reads will produce correct results most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as software engineers interested in building bulletproof systems, “most of the time” isn’t good enough, and we can do better. Let’s take a look at a technique to make sure that stale reads &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; occur. We’ll use Postgres’s own understanding of its replication state and some in-application intelligence around connection management to accomplish it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we’re going to have to understand a little bit about how replication works in Postgres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postgres commits all changes to a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;WAL&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (write-ahead log) for durability reasons. Every change is written out as a new entry in the WAL and it acts the canonical reference as to whether any change in the system occurred – committed information is written to a data directory like you might expect, but is only considered visible to new transactions if the WAL confirms that it’s committed (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://brandur.org/postgres-atomicity&quot;&gt;How Postgres makes transactions atomic&lt;/a&gt; for more on this subject).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes are written to the WAL one entry at a time and each one is assigned a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;LSN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (log sequence number). Changes are batched in 16 MB &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;WAL segments&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;wal-replication&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brandur.org/postgres-reads#wal-replication&quot;&gt;The WAL's role in replication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Postgres database can dump a representation of its current state to a &lt;em&gt;base backup&lt;/em&gt; which can be used to initialize replica. From there, the replica stays in lockstep with its primary by consuming changes in its emitted WAL. A base backup comes with a pointer to the current LSN so that when a replica starts to consume the WAL, it knows where to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brandur.org/assets/postgres-reads/replicas-and-wal.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-rjs=&quot;2&quot; src=&quot;https://brandur.org/assets/postgres-reads/replicas-and-wal.svg&quot; class=&quot;overflowing&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
A replica being initialized from base backup and consuming its primary's WAL.
&lt;p&gt;There are a few ways for a replica to consume WAL. The first is “log shipping”: completed WAL segments (16 MB chunks of the WAL) are copied from primary to replicas and consumed as a single batch. This has the major advantage of efficiency (it’s fast to copy files around, and has negligible cost to the primary), but with a tradeoff of how closely any secondary can be following its primary – secondaries will be at least as behind as the current segment that’s still being written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another common configuration for consuming WAL is “streaming”, where WAL is emitted by the primary to replicas over an open connection. This has the advantage of secondaries being very current at the cost of some extra resource consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on their respective aptitude’s for becoming primary at a moment’s notice, replicas consuming WAL with log shipping are also known as “warm standbys” while those using streaming are called “hot standbys”. Hot standbys are often seen in production setups because maintain state that closely matches their primary and make great targets to fail over to at a moment’s notice. The technique we’re going to discuss works better with streaming, but should yield at benefits with either method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By routing read operations only to replicas that are caught up enough to run them accurately, we can eliminate stale reads. This necessitates an easy way of measuring how far behind a replica is, and the WAL’s LSN is perfect for this use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When mutating a resource in the system we’ll store the last committed LSN for the entity making the request. Then, when we subsequently want to fulfill a read operation for that same entity, we’ll check which replicas have consumed to that point or beyond it, and randomly select one from the pool. If no replicas are sufficiently advanced (i.e. say a read operation is being run very closely after the initial write), we’ll fall back to the master. Stale reads become impossible regardless of the state of any given replica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brandur.org/assets/postgres-reads/routing.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-rjs=&quot;2&quot; src=&quot;https://brandur.org/assets/postgres-reads/routing.svg&quot; class=&quot;overflowing&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Routing read operations based on replica progress in the WAL.
&lt;p&gt;The technique is inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/2017/10/02/scaling-the-gitlab-database/#sticky-connections&quot;&gt;GitLab’s article on scaling their database&lt;/a&gt;, where they refer to it as “sticky connections”. Their large Postgres installation is still unpartitioned, and using replicas for extra read capacity is key in managing its considerable load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;rocket-rides&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brandur.org/postgres-reads#rocket-rides&quot;&gt;Scalable Rocket Rides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build a working demo we’ll be returning to the same toy application that we used to show off an implementation for &lt;a href=&quot;https://brandur.org/idempotency-keys&quot;&gt;idempotency keys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://brandur.org/redis-streams&quot;&gt;the unified log&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;em&gt;Rocket Rides&lt;/em&gt;. As a quick reminder, &lt;em&gt;Rocket Rides&lt;/em&gt; is a Lyft-like app that lets its users get rides with pilots wearing jetpacks; a vast improvement over the everyday banality of a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our new &lt;em&gt;Scalable Rocket Rides&lt;/em&gt; demo has an &lt;code&gt;api&lt;/code&gt; process that writes to a Postgres database. It’s configured with a number of read replicas that are configured with Postgres replication to receive changes from the primary. When performing a read, the &lt;code&gt;api&lt;/code&gt; tries to route it to one of a random replica that’s sufficiently caught up to fulfill the operation for a particular user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll be using the Sequel gem, which can be configured with a primary and any number of read replicas. Replicas are assigned names like &lt;code&gt;replica0&lt;/code&gt;, and operations are sent to them with the &lt;code&gt;server(...)&lt;/code&gt; helper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;DB = Sequel.connect(&quot;postgres://localhost:5433/rocket-rides-scalale&quot;,
  servers: {
    replica0: { port: 5434 },
    replica1: { port: 5435 },
    replica2: { port: 5436 },
    ...
  }

# routes to primary
DB[:users].update(...)

# routes to replica0
DB[:users].server(:replica0).select(...)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A working version of all this code is available in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/brandur/rocket-rides-scalable&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scalable Rocket Rides&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; repository. We’ll walk through the project with a number of extracted snippets, but if you prefer, you can download the code and follow along:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;git clone https://github.com/brandur/rocket-rides-scalable.git
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;cluster&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brandur.org/postgres-reads#cluster&quot;&gt;Bootstrapping a cluster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For demo purposes it’s useful to create a small locally-running cluster with a primary and some replicas. The project &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/brandur/rocket-rides-scalable/tree/master/scripts/create_cluster&quot;&gt;includes a small script to help with that&lt;/a&gt;. It initializes and starts a primary, and for a number of times equal to the &lt;code&gt;NUM_REPLICAS&lt;/code&gt; environment variable performs a base backup and boots a replica with it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postgres daemons are started as children of the script with Ruby’s &lt;code&gt;Process.spawn&lt;/code&gt; and will all die when it’s stopped. The setup’s designed to be ephemeral and any data added to the primary is removed when the cluster bootstraps itself again on the script’s next run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;observer&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brandur.org/postgres-reads#observer&quot;&gt;The Observer: tracking replication status&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To save every &lt;code&gt;api&lt;/code&gt; process from having to reach out and check on the replication status of every replica for itself, we’ll have a process called an &lt;code&gt;observer&lt;/code&gt; that periodically refreshes the state of every replica and stores it to a Postgres table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table contains a common &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; for each replica (e.g. &lt;code&gt;replica0&lt;/code&gt;) and a &lt;code&gt;last_lsn&lt;/code&gt; field that stores a sequence number as Postgres’s native &lt;code&gt;pg_lsn&lt;/code&gt; data type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;CREATE TABLE replica_statuses (
    id       BIGSERIAL    PRIMARY KEY,
    last_lsn PG_LSN       NOT NULL,
    name     VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE
);
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that this status information could really go anywhere. If we have Redis available, we could put it in there for fast access, or have every &lt;code&gt;api&lt;/code&gt; worker cache it in-process periodically for even faster access. Postgres is convenient, and as we’ll see momentarily, makes lookups quite elegant, but it’s not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;observer&lt;/code&gt; runs in a loop, and executes something like this on every iteration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;# exclude :default at the zero index
replica_names = DB.servers[1..-1]

last_lsns = replica_names.map do |name|
  DB.with_server(name) do
    DB[Sequel.lit(&amp;lt;&amp;lt;~eos)].first[:lsn]
      SELECT pg_last_wal_replay_lsn() AS lsn;
    eos
  end
end

insert_tuples = []
replica_names.each_with_index do |name, i|
  insert_tuples &amp;lt;&amp;lt; { name: name.to_s, last_lsn: last_lsns[i] }
end

# update all replica statuses at once with upsert
DB[:replica_statuses].
  insert_conflict(target: :name,
    update: { last_lsn: Sequel[:excluded][:last_lsn] }).
  multi_insert(insert_tuples)

$stdout.puts &quot;Updated replica LSNs: results=#{insert_tuples}&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A connection is made to every replica and &lt;code&gt;pg_last_wal_replay_lsn()&lt;/code&gt; is used to see its current location in the WAL. When all statuses have been collected, Postgres upsert (&lt;code&gt;INSERT INTO ... ON CONFLICT ...&lt;/code&gt;) is used to store the entire set to &lt;code&gt;replica_statuses&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;min-lsn&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brandur.org/postgres-reads#min-lsn&quot;&gt;Saving minimum LSN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing the status of our replicas is half of the implementation. The other half is knowing the minimum replication progress for every user that will give us the horizon beyond which stale reads are impossible. This is determined by saving the primary’s current LSN whenever the user makes a change in the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll model this as a &lt;code&gt;min_lsn&lt;/code&gt; field on our &lt;code&gt;users&lt;/code&gt; relation (and again use the built-in &lt;code&gt;pg_lsn&lt;/code&gt; data type):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;CREATE TABLE users (
    id      BIGSERIAL    PRIMARY KEY,
    email   VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    min_lsn PG_LSN
);
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any action that will later affect reads, we touch the user’s &lt;code&gt;min_lsn&lt;/code&gt; by setting it to the value of the primary’s &lt;code&gt;pg_current_wal_lsn()&lt;/code&gt;. This is performed in &lt;code&gt;update_user_min_lsn&lt;/code&gt; in this simple implementation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;post &quot;/rides&quot; do
  user = authenticate_user(request)
  params = validate_params(request)

  DB.transaction(isolation: :serializable) do
    ride = Ride.create(
      distance: params[&quot;distance&quot;],
      user_id: user.id,
    )
    update_user_min_lsn(user)

    [201, JSON.generate(serialize_ride(ride))]
  end
end

def update_user_min_lsn(user)
  User.
    where(id: user.id).
    update(Sequel.lit(&quot;min_lsn = pg_current_wal_lsn()&quot;))
end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;select-replica&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brandur.org/postgres-reads#select-replica&quot;&gt;Selecting an eligible replica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that replication status and minimum WAL progress for every user is being tracked, &lt;code&gt;api&lt;/code&gt; processes need a way to select an eligible replica candidate for read operations. Here’s an implementation that does just that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;def select_replica(user)
  # If the user's `min_lsn` is `NULL` then they haven't performed an operation
  # yet, and we don't yet know if we can use a replica yet. Default to the
  # primary.
  return :default if user.min_lsn.nil?

  # exclude :default at the zero index
  replica_names = DB.servers[1..-1].map { |name| name.to_s }

  res = DB[Sequel.lit(&amp;lt;&amp;lt;~eos), replica_names, user.min_lsn]
    SELECT name
    FROM replica_statuses
    WHERE name IN ?
      AND pg_wal_lsn_diff(last_lsn, ?) &amp;gt;= 0;
  eos

  # If no candidates are caught up enough, then go to the primary.
  return :default if res.nil? || res.empty?

  # Return a random replica name from amongst the candidates.
  candidate_names = res.map { |res| res[:name].to_sym }
  candidate_names.sample
end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pg_wal_lsn_diff()&lt;/code&gt; returns the difference between two &lt;code&gt;pg_lsn&lt;/code&gt; values, and we use it to compare the stored status of each replica in &lt;code&gt;replica_statuses&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;min_lsn&lt;/code&gt; value of the current user (&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;= 0&lt;/code&gt; means that the replica is ahead of the user’s minimum). We take the name of a random replica from the returned set. If the set was empty, then no replica is advanced enough for our purposes, so we fall back to the primary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s &lt;code&gt;select_replica&lt;/code&gt; in action on an API endpoint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;get &quot;/rides/:id&quot; do |id|
  user = authenticate_user(request)

  name = select_replica(user)
  $stdout.puts &quot;Reading ride #{id} from server '#{name}'&quot;

  ride = Ride.server(name).first(id: id)
  if ride.nil?
    halt 404, JSON.generate(wrap_error(
      Messages.error_not_found(object: &quot;ride&quot;, id: id)
    ))
  end

  [200, JSON.generate(serialize_ride(ride))]
end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s it! The repository also comes with a simulator that creates a new ride and then immediately tries to read it. Running the whole constellation of programs will show that most of the time these reads will be served from a replica, but occasionally from the primary (&lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; in Sequel) as replication falls behind or the &lt;code&gt;observer&lt;/code&gt; hasn’t performed its work loop in a while:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ forego start | grep 'Reading ride'
api.1       | Reading ride 96 from server 'replica0'
api.1       | Reading ride 97 from server 'replica0'
api.1       | Reading ride 98 from server 'replica0'
api.1       | Reading ride 99 from server 'replica1'
api.1       | Reading ride 100 from server 'replica4'
api.1       | Reading ride 101 from server 'replica2'
api.1       | Reading ride 102 from server 'replica0'
api.1       | Reading ride 103 from server 'default'
api.1       | Reading ride 104 from server 'default'
api.1       | Reading ride 105 from server 'replica2'
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe. The implementation’s major downside is that each user’s &lt;code&gt;min_lsn&lt;/code&gt; needs to be updated every time an action that affects read results is performed. If you squint just a little bit, you’ll notice that this looks a lot like cache invalidation – a technique infamous for working well until it doesn’t. In a more complex codebase save hooks and update triggers can be useful in helping to ensure correctness, but given enough lines of code and enough people working on it, &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; correctness can be frustratingly elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects that produce only moderate database load (the majority of all projects) shouldn’t bother, and keep their implementations simple by running everything against the primary. Projects that need infinitely scalable storage (i.e. disk usage is expected to grow well beyond what a single node can handle) should probably look into a more elaborate partitioning scheme (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citusdata.com/&quot;&gt;like Citus&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a sweet spot of projects that can keep their storage within a single node, but still want to scale out on computation. For this sort of use moving reads to replicas can be quite beneficial because it greatly expands the runway for scalability while also avoiding the considerable overhead and operational complexity of partitioning.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Coders who trade: Wall Street designs its staff for the future</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Stay relevant’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Citigroup, employees are being pushed to think differently about how they approach their jobs and help clients, according to Vanessa Colella, chief innovation officer and head of its venture-investing unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About two years ago it launched a program called Discover 10X asking employees to suggest new products or innovations. Some have been honed through an intense process of workshops, pitches and viability studies, with the best ideas getting additional funding. While it’s not designed as training, it helps employees “explore and get a window into a different way of thinking,” Colella said. “That tends to snowball.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees at EY will soon be able to earn “badges” showing they can work with new technologies. The professional-services firm plans to debut the program in November at offices in more than 150 countries. Employees will be able to demonstrate four levels of expertise in “future-focused” topics, such as artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The fear factor of ‘What happens if my job is automated and goes away?’ can be high if you don’t replace it with ‘Here’s how you can stay relevant,’” said Nancy Altobello, the firm’s global vice chair of talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A catalog will steer workers to lessons online and in classrooms. Afterward, they will have to demonstrate their knowledge through activities, such as volunteering for a panel, coaching colleagues or writing an article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since EY &lt;a class=&quot;terminal-news-story&quot; title=&quot;Ernst &amp;amp; Young: New program will allow EY people to earn credentials in future-focused skills&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/OUOWO6BE07I9&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the program in August, clients have been asking how they can offer it to their own staffs. “I expect there will be a market interest in it, not necessarily us having to go to people and tell them about it,” Altobello said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many big firms are still working out their approaches. Sherrie Littlejohn, head of Wells Fargo’s internal innovation strategies, told a &lt;a title=&quot;CB Insights Conference Transcript&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbinsights.com/research/wells-fargo-citi-disruption-fintech-relevance/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt; in June that busy employees will need help adapting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to need new skills,” she said. Yet, “we’re so busy operationally trying to keep things running that we haven’t seen a way to kind of make room for us to learn and train and teach — and be curious about how to make this new world come to fruition.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>$3 Trillion in Forgotten Debt</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2017-03-20/say-hello-to-3-trillion-in-forgotten-debt</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2017-03-20/say-hello-to-3-trillion-in-forgotten-debt</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Companies have been on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-21/why-corporate-america-s-debt-is-a-major-risk&quot; title=&quot;Why Corporate America’s Debt Is a ‘Major Risk’&quot;&gt;borrowing binge&lt;/a&gt;, but you wouldn't always know the full scale of their liabilities by looking at the balance sheet. This makes it hard for investors to compare businesses that fund their activities in different ways. Happily though, that's about to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How come? The answer is buried in the notes to financial statements (you know, the ones you don't bother reading). It's here that companies have parked about $3 trillion in operating lease obligations, according to Bloomberg data.  For non-financial companies, those obligations equate to more than one quarter of their long-term (on-balance sheet) debt.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating leases are actually pretty similar to debt. They represent money companies will be obliged to cough up in future to rent things like planes, ships and retail floor space. But right now you won't find them on the balance sheet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;toaster-chart&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lease Leaders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These companies are among the largest users of operating leases&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source: Bloomberg&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2019, this will change. New accounting rules called IFRS 16  will force companies to include operating lease commitments as part of their reported debt and assets. Heavy lease users in the retail, telecoms, energy and airline sectors will probably be most affected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;toaster-chart&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leverage Hangover&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IFRS 16 will cause debt to balloon. In some cases, it'll be ugly&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source: PwC&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upshot: this is going to make companies appear &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2016-04-11/as-bad-as-sprint-s-debt-burden-looks-it-s-probably-worse&quot; title=&quot;Sprint's Hidden Debt Bomb&quot;&gt;far more leveraged&lt;/a&gt;. Debt will increase compared to equity. At the same time, earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization may increase because leases will be depreciated, not expensed. Retailers can typically expect an Ebitda uplift of more than 40 percent, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/audit-services/publications/assets/a-study-on-the-impact-of-lease-capitalisation.pdf&quot; title=&quot;PwC study on leases&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/audit-services/publications/assets/a-study-on-the-impact-of-lease-capitalisation.pdf&quot;&gt;PwC found&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact on reported liabilities is likely to prove most significant though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sympathize if you're tempted to dismiss this is as another dull accounting exercise. Total cash flow won't be affected, and cash is what pays the bills and determines the value of a business. Furthermore, rating agencies and analysts already adjust for leases when assessing credit-worthiness .  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some companies already spell out the impact of leases on total indebtedness. Air France-KLM's reported net debt is 3.7 billion euros ($3.9 billion) but its lease-adjusted net debt is 11.2 billion euros. The present value of Tesco's operating lease commitments is one and a half times the size of reported net debt, according to its 2016 annual report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, I doubt this transition will be painless. At the very least, the rule change should give armchair investors, not to mention a company's customers, employees and suppliers, a much better idea of how risky a business is compared to rivals. For some folk, this will be a nasty surprise. Worries about corporate leverage are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2017-03-07/top-rated-debt-is-poised-to-fall-as-leverage-swells&quot; title=&quot;Top-Rated Credit Is Poised to Fall&quot;&gt;already widespread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, companies aren't always as forthcoming as you might hope. Some airlines make debt adjustments for aircraft leases but not for other off-balance sheet rental agreements such as airport buildings. Delta Air Lines Inc. reported $6.1 billion in adjusted net debt at the end of December, including $2 billion in aircraft rent liabilities. Yet the discounted value of all its operating leases is closer to $9 billion, Gadfly estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, there's precedent for seemingly cosmetic accounting changes to impact valuation. Last year, British aircraft engine maker Rolls-Royce Plc said it would report &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2016-11-16/rolls-royce-thinks-too-highly-of-itself&quot; title=&quot;Rolls-Royce Thinks Too Highly of Itself&quot;&gt;lower profit&lt;/a&gt; under a separate new accounting standard (IFRS 15). Its shares fell even though it stressed that cash flow would stay the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accounting reform can also affect corporate behavior. When British companies had to start recognizing the full liability for defined benefit pensions on financial statements, a lot of those &quot;final salary&quot; plans ended up closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's conceivable therefore that IFRS 16 will affect corporate decisions on whether to rent or purchase an asset. Consider sale and lease-back arrangements. These were once a popular way for companies to get their hands on some cash and a quick chance for executives to make themselves look like geniuses. All of a sudden, return on assets improved. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if all that rented floor space has to sit on the balance sheet anyway, selling off the corporate silverware might become less attractive. Buying big ticket assets, rather than leasing, is also cheaper now because of low interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another approach may see some companies partly embrace shorter lease terms to minimize the balance sheet liability, according to Ruxandra Haradau-Doser, aviation analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux. Shorter leases are already common in retail, albeit for different reasons. With sales migrating online, retailers want more flexibility to close stores. IFRS 16 could accelerate that&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;toaster-chart&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rental Culture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airlines and retailers are big fans of operating leases&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source: IASB&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accounting changes could also lead to more volatility in financial results, according to James Stamp, a partner at KPMG. Airlines typically take out aircraft leases in U.S. dollars. If the carrier's domestic currency weakens against the dollar, its liabilities would suddenly increase and it would have to take a currency hit against earnings. Stamp thinks demand for hedging will rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far from being academic, the accounting changes will have an effect in the real world. Some may be profound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share this story&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the more surprising stories of the past year was Microsoft's announcement that it was going to use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/02/microsoft-hosts-the-windows-source-in-a-monstrous-300gb-git-repository/&quot;&gt;Git version control system for Windows development&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft had to modify Git to handle the demands of Windows development but said that it wanted to get these modifications accepted upstream and integrated into the standard Git client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That plan appears to be going well. Yesterday, the company announced that &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2017/11/15/updates-to-gvfs/&quot;&gt;GitHub was adopting its modifications&lt;/a&gt; and that the two would be working together to bring suitable clients to macOS and Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft wanted to move to Git because of Git's features, like its easy branching and its popularity among developers. But the transition faced three problems. Git wasn't designed for such vast numbers of developers—more than 3,000 actively working on the codebase. Also, Git wasn't designed for a codebase that was so large, either in terms of the number of files and version history for each file, or in terms of sheer size, coming in at more than 300GB. When using standard Git, working with the source repository was unacceptably slow. Common operations (such as checking which files have been modified) would take multiple minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company's solution was to develop Git Virtual File System (GVFS). With GVFS, a local replica of a Git repository is virtualized such that it contains metadata and only the source code files that have been explicitly retrieved. By eliminating the need to replicate &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; file (and, hence, check &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; file for modifications), both the disk footprint of the repository and the speed of working with it were greatly improved. Microsoft modified Git to handle this virtual file system. The client was altered so that it didn't needlessly try to access files that weren't available locally and a new transfer protocol was added for selectively retrieving individual files from a remote repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internally, this &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/90-of-windows-devs-now-using-git-creating-1760-windows-builds-per-day/&quot;&gt;proved successful&lt;/a&gt;, with Windows development being substantially migrated to Git in May of this year. But what of the broader Git community?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft says that, so far, about half of its modifications have been accepted upstream, with upstream Git developers broadly approving of the approach the company has taken to improve the software's scaling. Redmond also says that it has been willing to make changes to its approach to satisfy the demands of upstream Git. The biggest complexity is that Git has a very conservative approach to compatibility, requiring that repositories remain compatible across versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub's interest and involvement is motivated by the company's desire to address the needs of enterprise customers. The open source, free GitHub hosting doesn't need the scaling work Microsoft has done—obviously, if someone is using standard Git, today then standard Git must be good enough for their development process. But on the paid, enterprise side, the situation can be a little different. Certain industries have large repositories that pose problems with Git; for example, game repositories are often physically large not because they have millions of files and decades of history, but because of their large number of graphics and other assets. The scaling improvements that Microsoft has made to Git are useful for this kind of large repository, too. As such, having the same family of improvements available in GitHub will enable the company to better serve these communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft itself has had similar demands from enterprise; the company told us that Siemens wanted to move away from the Team Foundation Server version control &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/git/&quot;&gt;to using Git instead&lt;/a&gt;. But it'll only be able to do this once the scaling improvements had been made; right now, TFS version control scales better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name would imply, GVFS requires a file system driver to work. The Windows division worked with the engineering team to add features to Windows to make this efficient. The intent is to eventually make this capability into a supported, extensible API and, at some point, move systems such as the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/06/onedrive-done-right-is-back-and-now-it-works-properly/&quot;&gt;OneDrive placeholders&lt;/a&gt; to use the same API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and GitHub are also working to bring similar capabilities to other platforms, with macOS coming first, and later Linux. The obvious way to do this on both systems is to use FUSE, an infrastructure for building file systems that run in user mode rather than kernel mode (desirable because user-mode development is easier and safer than kernel mode). However, the companies have discovered that FUSE isn't fast enough for this—a lesson Dropbox also learned when developing a similar capability, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/04/dropboxs-project-infinite-shows-all-your-files-locally-without-using-any-disk-space/&quot;&gt;Project Infinite&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, the companies believe that tapping into a macOS extensibility mechanism called Kauth (or KAuth) will be the best way forward.&lt;/p&gt;

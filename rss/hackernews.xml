<title>DRM’s Dead Canary: How We Lost the Web, What We Learned, and What to Do Next</title>
<link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/10/drms-dead-canary-how-we-just-lost-web-what-we-learned-it-and-what-we-need-do-next</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/10/drms-dead-canary-how-we-just-lost-web-what-we-learned-it-and-what-we-need-do-next</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;EFF has been fighting against DRM and the laws behind it for a decade and a half, intervening in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/broadcastflag&quot;&gt;US Broadcast Flag&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/wipo-broadcasting-treaty&quot;&gt;UN Broadcasting Treaty&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://w2.eff.org/IP/DVB/dvb_paper_032007.pdf&quot;&gt;European DVB CPCM standard&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-makes-formal-objection-drm-html5&quot;&gt;W3C EME standard&lt;/a&gt; and many other skirmishes, battles and even wars over the years. With that long history behind us, there are two things we want you to know about DRM:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Everybody on the inside secretly knows that DRM &lt;em&gt;technology&lt;/em&gt; is irrelevant, but DRM &lt;em&gt;law&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reason companies want DRM has nothing to do with copyright.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two points have just been demonstrated in a messy, drawn-out fight over the standardization of DRM in browsers, and since we threw a lot of blood and treasure at that fight, one thing we hope to salvage is an object lesson that will drive these two points home and provide a roadmap for the future of DRM fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DRM IS TECHNOLOGICALLY BANKRUPT; DRM LAW IS DEADLY&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how DRM works, at a high level: a company wants to provide a customer (you) with digital asset (like a movie, a book, a song, a video game or an app), but they want to control what you do with that file after you get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they encrypt the file. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/encrypt-the-web&quot;&gt;We &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; encryption&lt;/a&gt;. Encryption &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt;. With relatively little effort, anyone can scramble a file so well that no one will ever be able to decrypt it unless they're provided with the key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say this is Netflix. They send you a movie that's been scrambled and they want to be sure you can't save it and watch it later from your hard-drive. But they also need to give you a way to view the movie, too. At some point, that means unscrambling the movie. And there's only one way to unscramble a file that's been competently encrypted: you have to use the key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Netflix also gives you the unscrambling key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you have the key, you can just unscramble the Netflix movies and save them to your hard drive. How can Netflix give you the key but control how you use it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix has to &lt;em&gt;hide&lt;/em&gt; the key, somewhere on your computer, like in a browser extension or an app. This is where the technological bankruptcy comes in. Hiding something well is hard. Hiding something well in a piece of equipment that you give to your adversary to take away with them and do anything they want with is &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you can't find the keys that Netflix hid in your browser. But someone can: a bored grad student with a free weekend, a self-taught genius decapping a chip in their basement, a competitor with a full-service lab. One tiny flaw in any part of the fragile wrapping around these keys, and they're free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And once that flaw is exposed, anyone can write an app or a browser plugin that does have a save button. It's game over for the DRM technology. (The keys &lt;a href=&quot;https://freedom-to-tinker.com/index.php?s=aacs&quot;&gt;escape pretty regularly, just as fast as they can be revoked by the DRM companies&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DRM gets made over the course of years, by skilled engineers, at a cost of millions of dollars. It gets broken in days, by teenagers, with hobbyist equipment. That's not because the DRM-makers are stupid, it's because they're &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; something stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is where the law comes in. DRM law gives rightsholders more forceful, far-ranging legal powers than laws governing any other kind of technology. In 1998, Congress passed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), whose Section 1201 provides for felony liability for anyone commercially engaged in bypassing a DRM system: 5 years in prison and a $500,000 fine for a &lt;em&gt;first offense&lt;/em&gt;. Even noncommercial bypass of DRM is subject to liability. It also makes it legally risky to even &lt;em&gt;talk&lt;/em&gt; about how to bypass a DRM system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the law shores up DRM systems with a broad range of threats. If Netflix designs a video player that won't save a video unless you break some DRM, they now have the right to sue -- or sic the police -- on any rival that rolls out an improved alternative streaming client, or a video-recorder that works with Netflix. Such tools wouldn't violate copyright law any more than a VCR or a Tivo does, but because that recorder would have to break Netflix DRM, they could use DRM law to crush it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DRM law goes beyond mere bans on tampering with DRM. Companies also use Section 1201 of the DMCA to threaten security researchers who discover flaws in their products. The law becomes a weapon they can aim at anyone who wants to warn their customers (still you) that the products you're relying on aren't fit for use. That includes warning people about flaws in DRM that expose them to being hacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not just the USA and not just the DMCA, either. The US Trade Representative has &quot;convinced&quot; countries around the world to adopt a version of this rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DRM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH COPYRIGHT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DRM law has the power to do untold harm. Because it affords corporations the power to control the use of their products after sale, the power to decide who can compete with them and under what circumstances, and even who gets to warn people about defective products, DRM laws represent a powerful temptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things that aren't copyright infringement: buying a DVD while you're on holiday and playing it when you get home. It is obviously not a copyright infringement to go into a store in (say) New Delhi and buy a DVD and bring it home to (say) Topeka. The rightsholder made their movie, sold it to the retailer, and you paid the retailer the asking price. This is the opposite of copyright infringement. That's paying for works on the terms set by the rightsholder. But because DRM stops you from playing out-of-region discs on your home player, the studios can invoke copyright law to decide where you can consume the copyrighted works you've bought, fair and square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other not-infringements: fixing your car (GM uses DRM to control who can diagnose an engine, and to force mechanics to spend tens of thousands of dollars for diagnostic information they could otherwise determine themselves or obtain from third parties); refilling an ink cartridge (HP pushed out a fake security update that added DRM to millions of inkjet printers so that they'd refuse remanufactured or third-party cartridges), or toasting home-made bread (though this hasn't happened yet, there's no reason that a company couldn't put DRM in its toasters to control whose bread you can use).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also not a copyright infringement to watch Netflix in a browser that Netflix hasn't approved. It's not a copyright infringement to record a Netflix movie to watch later. It's not a copyright infringement to feed a Netflix video to an algorithm that can warn you about upcoming strobe effects that can trigger life-threatening seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WHICH BRINGS US TO THE W3C&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The W3C is the world's foremost open web standards body, a consortium whose members (companies, universities, government agencies, civil society groups and others) engage in protracted wrangles over the best way for everyone to deliver web content. They produce &quot;recommendations&quot; (W3C-speak for &quot;standards&quot;) that form the invisible struts that hold up the web. These agreements, produced through patient negotiation and compromise, represent an agreement by major stakeholders about the best (or least-worst) way to solve thorny technological problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Netflix and a few other media companies convinced the W3C to start work on a DRM system for the web. This DRM system, Encrypted Media Extensions (EME), represented a sharp departure from the W3C's normal business. First, EME would not be a complete standard: the organization would specify an API through which publishers and browser vendors would make DRM work, but the actual &quot;content decryption module&quot; (CDM) wouldn't be defined by the standard. That means that EME was a standard in name only: if you started a browser company and followed all the W3C's recommendations, you still wouldn't be able to play back a Netflix video. For that, you'd need Netflix's permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to overstate how weird this is. Web standards are about &quot;permissionless interoperability.&quot; The standards for formatting text mean that anyone can make a tool that can show you pages from the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;' website; images from Getty; or interactive charts on Bloomberg. The companies can still decide who can see which pages on their websites (by deciding who gets a password and which parts of the website each password unlocks), but they don't get to decide who can make the web browsing program you type the password into in order to access the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A web in which every publisher gets to pick and choose which browsers you can use to visit their sites is a very different one from the historical web. Historically, anyone could make a new browser by making sure it adhered to W3C recommendations, and then start to compete. And while the web has always been dominated by a few browsers, &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; browsers dominate have changed every decade or so, as new companies and even nonprofits like Mozilla (who make Firefox) overthrew the old order. Technologies that have stood in the way of this permissionless interoperabilty -- for instance, patent-encumbered video -- have been seen as impediments to the idea of the open web, not standardization opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the W3C starts making technologies that only work when they're blessed by a handful of entertainment companies, they're putting their thumbs -- their &lt;em&gt;fists&lt;/em&gt; -- on the scales in favor of ensuring that the current browser giants get to enjoy a permanent reign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's the least of it. Until EME, W3C standards were designed to give the users of the web (e.g. you) more control over what your computer did while you were accessing other peoples' websites. With EME -- and for the first time ever -- the W3C is designing technology that takes away your control. EME is designed to allow Netflix -- and other big companies -- to decide what your browser does, even (especially) when you disagree about what that should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the earliest days of computing, there's been a simmering debate about whether computers exist to control their users, or vice versa (as the visionary computer scientist and education specialist Seymour Papert put it, &quot;children should be programming the computer rather than being programmed by it&quot; -- that applies equally well to adults). Every W3C standard until 2017 was on the side of people controlling computers. EME breaks with that. It is a subtle, but profound shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WHY WOULD THE W3C DO THIS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ay yi yi. &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; is the three billion user question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The W3C version of the story goes something like this. The rise of apps has weakened the web. In the pre-app days, the web was the only game in town, so companies had to play by web rules: open standards, open web. But now that apps exist and nearly everyone uses them, big companies can boycott the web, forcing their users into apps instead. That just accelerates the rise of apps, and weakens the web even more. Apps are used to implement DRM, so DRM-using companies are moving to apps. To keep entertainment companies from killing the web outright, the Web must have DRM too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if those companies don't abandon the web altogether, continues this argument, getting them to make their DRM at the W3C is better than letting them make it on an ad-hoc basis. Left to their own devices, they could make DRM that made no accommodations for people with disabilities, and without the W3C's moderating influence, these companies would make DRM that would be hugely invasive of web users' privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument ends with a broad justification for DRM: companies have the right to protect their copyrights. We can't expect an organization to spend fortunes creating or licensing movies and then distribute them in a way that lets anyone copy and share them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think that these arguments don't hold much water. The web does indeed lack some of its earlier only-game-in-town muscle, but the reality is that companies make money by going where their customers are, and every potential customer has a browser, while only &lt;em&gt;existing&lt;/em&gt; customers have a company's apps. The more hoops a person has to jump through in order to become your customer, the fewer customers you'll have. Netflix is in a hyper-competitive market with tons of new entrants (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-disney-streaming-20170907-story.html&quot;&gt;Disney&lt;/a&gt;), and being &quot;that streaming service you can't use on the web&quot; is a serious deficit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also think that the media companies and tech companies would struggle to arrive at a standard for DRM outside of the W3C, even a really terrible one. We've spent a lot of time in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/effector/15/13&quot;&gt;the smoke-filled rooms of DRM standardization&lt;/a&gt; and the core dynamic there is the media companies demanding full-on lockdown for every frame of video, and tech companies insisting that the best anyone can hope for is an ineffectual &quot;speed-bump&quot; that they hope will mollify the media companies. Often as not, these negotiations collapse under their own weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there's the matter of patents: companies that think DRM is a good idea also &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; software patents, and the result is an impenetrable thicket of patents that make getting anything done next to impossible. The W3C's patent-pooling mechanism (which is uniquely comprehensive in the standards world and stands as an example of the best way to do this sort of thing) was essential to making DRM standardization possible. What's more, there are key players in the DRM world, like Adobe, who hold significant patent portfolios but are playing an ever-dwindling role in the world of DRM (the avowed goal of EME was to &quot;kill Flash&quot;). If the companies involved had to all sit down and negotiate a new patent deal without the W3C's framework, any of these companies could &quot;turn troll&quot; and insist that all the rest would have to shell out big dollars to license their patents -- they have nothing to lose by threatening the entire enterprise, and everything to gain from even a minuscule per-user royalty for something that will be rolled out into &lt;em&gt;three billion&lt;/em&gt; browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there's no indication that EME had anything to do with protecting legitimate business interests. Streaming video services like Netflix rely on customers to subscribe to a whole library with constantly added new materials and a recommendation engine to help them navigate the catalog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DRM for streaming video is all about preventing competition, not protecting copyrights. The purpose of DRM is to give companies the legal tools to prevent activities that would otherwise be allowed. The DRM part doesn't have to &quot;work&quot; (in the sense of preventing copyright infringement) so long as it allows for the invocation of the DMCA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see how true this is, just look at Widevine, Google's version of EME. Google bought the company that made Widevine in 2010, but it wasn't until 2016 that an independent researcher actually took a close look at how well it prevented videos from leaking. That researcher, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2016/06/bug-chrome-makes-easy-pirate-movies/&quot;&gt;David Livshits found that Widevine was trivial to circumvent&lt;/a&gt;, and it had been since its inception, and that the errors that made Widevine so ineffective were obvious to even a cursory examination. If the millions of dollars and the high-power personnel committed to EME were allocated to create a technology that would effectively prevent copyright infringement, then you'd think that Netflix or one of the other media companies in the negotiations would have diverted some of those resources to a quick audit to make sure that the stuff actually worked as advertised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Funny story: Livshits is an Israeli at Ben Gurion University, and Israel happens to be the rare country that doesn't ban breaking DRM, meaning that Israelis are among the only people who can do this kind of research without fear of legal retaliation)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the biggest proof that EME was just a means to shut down legitimate competitors -- and not an effort to protect copyright -- is what happened next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When EFF joined the W3C, our opening bid was &quot;Don't make DRM.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We put the case to the organization, describing the way that DRM interferes with the important copyright exceptions (like those that allow people to record and remix copyrighted works for critical or transformative purposes) and the myriad problems presented by the DMCA and laws like it around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executive team of the W3C basically dismissed all arguments about fair use and user rights in copyright as a kind of unfortunate casualty of the need to keep Netflix from ditching the web in favor of apps, and as for the DMCA, they said that they couldn't do anything about this crazy law, but they were sure that the W3C's members were not interested in abusing the DMCA, they just wanted to keep their high-value movies from being shared on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we changed tack, and proposed a kind of &quot;controlled experiment&quot; to find out what the DRM fans at the W3C were trying to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The W3C is a consensus body: it makes standards by getting everyone in a room to compromise, moving toward a position that everyone can live with. Our ideal world was &quot;No DRM at the W3C,&quot; and DRM is a bad enough idea that it was hard to imagine much of a compromise from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after listening closely to the DRM side's disavowals of DMCA abuse, we thought we could find something that would represent an improvement on the current status quo and that should fit with their stated views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We proposed a kind of DRM non-aggression pact, through which W3C members would promise that they'd only sue people under laws like DMCA 1201 if there was some other law that had been broken. So if someone violates your copyright, or incites someone to violate your copyright, or interferes with your contracts with your users, or misappropriates your trade secrets, or counterfeits your trademarks, or does &lt;em&gt;anything else that violates your legal rights&lt;/em&gt;, you can throw the book at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if someone goes around your DRM and &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; violate any other laws, the non-aggression pact means that you couldn't use the W3C standardised DRM as a route to legally shut them down. That would protect security researchers, it would protect people analyzing video to add subtitles and other assistive features, it would protect archivists who had the legal right to make copies, and it would protect people making new browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all you care about is making an effective technology that prevents lawbreaking, this agreement should be a no-brainer. For starters, if you think DRM &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an effective technology, it shouldn't matter if it's illegal to criticize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And since the nonaggression pact kept all other legal rights intact, there was no risk that agreeing to it would allow someone to break the law with impunity. Anyone who violated copyrights (or any other rights) would be square in the DMCA's crosshairs, and companies would have their finger on the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOT SURPRISED BUT STILL DISAPPOINTED&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, they &lt;em&gt;hated&lt;/em&gt; this idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studios, the DRM vendors and the large corporate members of the W3C participated in a desultory, brief &quot;negotiation&quot; before voting to terminate further discussion and press on. The W3C executive helped them dodge discussions, chartering further work on EME without any parallel work on protecting the open web, even as opposition within the W3C mounted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time the dust settled, EME was published after the most divided votes the W3C had ever seen, with the W3C executive unilaterally &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-media/2017Jul/0000.html&quot;&gt;declaring&lt;/a&gt; that issues for security research, accessibility, archiving and innovation had been dealt with as much as they could be (despite the fact that literally nothing binding was done about any of these things). The &quot;consensus&quot; process of the W3C has so thoroughly hijacked that EME's publication was only supported &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/09/drm-for-html5-published-as-a-w3c-recommendation-after-58-4-approval/&quot;&gt;by 58% of the members&lt;/a&gt; who voted in the final poll, and many of those members expressed regret that they were cornered into voting for something they objected to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the W3C executive declared that any protections for the open web were incompatible with the desires of the DRM-boosters, it was a kind of ironic vindication. After all, this is where we'd started, with EFF insisting that DRM wasn't compatible with security disclosures, with accessibility, with archiving or innovation. Now, it seemed, everyone agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, they all implicitly agreed that DRM wasn't about protecting copyright. It was about using copyright to seize other rights, like the right to decide who could criticize your product -- or compete with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DRM's sham cryptography means that it only works if you're not allowed to know about its defects. This proposition was conclusively proved when &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-media/2017Jun/0015.html&quot;&gt;a W3C member proposed&lt;/a&gt; that the Consortium should protect disclosures that affected EME's &quot;privacy sandbox&quot; and opened users to invasive spying, and within minutes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-media/2017Jun/0017.html&quot;&gt;Netflix's representative said that even this was not worth considering.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a twisted way, Netflix was right. DRM is so fragile, so incoherent, that it is simply incompatible with the norms of the marketplace and science, in which anyone is free to describe their truthful discoveries, even if they frustrate a giant company's commercial aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The W3C tacitly admitted this when they tried to convene &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2016/02/proposed-techpolig.htm&quot;&gt;a discussion group&lt;/a&gt; to come up with some nonbinding guidelines for when EME-using companies should use the power of DRM law to punish their critics and when they should permit the criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&quot;RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE&quot; ON OUR TERMS, OR JAIL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They called this &quot;responsible disclosure,&quot; but it was far from the kinds of &quot;responsible disclosure&quot; we see today. In current practice, companies offer security researchers enticements to disclose their discoveries to vendors before going public. These enticements range from bug-bounty programs that pay out cash, to leaderboards that provide glory to the best researchers, to binding promises to act on disclosures in a timely way, rather than crossing their fingers, sitting on the newly discovered defects, and hoping no one else re-discovers them and exploits them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tension between independent security researchers and corporations is as old as computing itself. Computers are hard to secure, thanks to their complexity. Perfection is elusive. Keeping the users of networked computers safe requires constant evaluation and disclosure, so that vendors can fix their bugs and users can make informed decisions about which systems are safe enough to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But companies aren't always the best stewards of bad news about their own products. As researchers have discovered -- the hard way -- telling a company about its mistakes may be the polite thing to do, but it's very risky behavior, apt to get you threatened with legal reprisals if you go public. Many's the researcher who told a company about a bug, only to have the company sit on that news for an intolerably long time, putting its users at risk. Often, these bugs only come to light when they are independently discovered by bad actors, who figure out how to exploit them, turning them into attacks that compromise millions of users, so many that the bug's existence can no longer be swept under the rug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the research world grew more gunshy about talking to companies, companies were forced to make real, binding assurances that they would honor the researchers' discoveries by taking swift action in a defined period, by promising not to threaten researchers over presenting their findings, and even by bidding for researchers' trust with cash bounties. Over the years, the situation has improved, with most big companies offering some kind of disclosure program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the reason companies offer those bounties and assurances is that &lt;em&gt;they have no choice&lt;/em&gt;. Telling the truth about defective products is not illegal, so researchers who discover those truths are under no obligation to play by companies' rules. That forces companies to demonstrate their goodwill with good conduct, binding promises and pot-sweeteners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies definitely want to be able to decide who can tell the truth about their products and when. We know that because when they get the chance to flex that muscle, they flex it. We know it because they said so at the W3C. We know it because they demanded that they get that right as part of the DRM package in EME.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the lows in the W3C DRM process, the most shocking was when the historic defenders of the open web tried to turn an effort to protect the rights of researchers to warn billions of people about harmful defects in their browsers into an effort to advise companies on when they should hold off on exercising that right -- a right they wouldn’t have without the W3C making DRM for the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DRM IS THE OPPOSITE OF SECURITY&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the first days of the DRM fight at the W3C, we understood that the DRM vendors and the media companies they supplied weren't there to protect copyright, they were there to grab legally enforceable non-copyright privileges. We also knew that DRM was incompatible with security research: because DRM relies on obfuscation, anyone who documents how DRM works also makes it stop working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially clear in terms of what &lt;em&gt;wasn't&lt;/em&gt; said at the W3C: when we proposed that people should be able to break DRM to generate subtitles or conduct security audits, the arguments were always about whether that was acceptable, but it was never about whether it was possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall that EME is supposed to be a system that helps companies ensure that their movies aren't saved to their users' hard-drives and shared around the internet. For this to work, it should be, you know, &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in every discussion of when people should be allowed to break EME, it was always a given that anyone who wanted to could do so. After all, when you hide secrets in software you give to people who you want to keep them secret from, you are probably going to be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From day one, we understood that we would arrive at a point in which the DRM advocates at the W3C would be obliged to admit that the survival of their plan relied on being able to silence people who examined their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we did hold out hope that when this became clear to everyone, that they would understand that DRM couldn't peacefully co-exist with the open web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;THE W3C IS THE CANARY IN THE COALMINE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of DRM at the W3C is a parable about market concentration and the precarity of the open web. Hundreds of security researchers lobbied the W3C to protect their work, UNESCO publicly condemned the extension of DRM to the web, and the many crypto-currency members of the W3C warned that using browsers for secure, high-stakes applications like moving around peoples' life-savings could only happen if browsers were subjected to the same security investigations as every other technology in our life (except DRM technologies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no shortage of businesses that want to be able to control what their customers and competitors do with their products. When the US Copyright Office &lt;a href=&quot;http://copyright.gov/1201/2015/comments-020615/&quot;&gt;held hearings on DRM in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, they heard about DRM in medical implants and cars, farm equipment and voting machines. Companies have discovered that adding DRM to their products is the most robust way to control the marketplace, a cheap and reliable way to convert commercial preferences about who can repair, improve, and supply their products into legally enforceable rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marketplace harms from this anti-competitive behavior are easy to see. For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifixit.org/revolution&quot;&gt;aggressive use of DRM to prevent independent repair shops&lt;/a&gt; ends up diverting tons of e-waste to landfill or recycling, at the cost of local economies and the ability of people to get full use out of your property. A phone that you recycle instead of repairing is a phone you have to pay to replace -- and repair creates many more jobs than recycling (recycling a ton of e-waste creates &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifixit.org/revolution&quot;&gt;15 jobs&lt;/a&gt;; repairing it creates &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifixit.org/revolution&quot;&gt;150 jobs&lt;/a&gt;). Repair jobs are local, entrepreneurial jobs, because you don't need a lot of capital to start a repair shop, and your customers want to bring their gadgets to someone local for service (no one wants to send a phone to China for repairs -- let alone a car!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those economic harms are only the tip of the iceberg. Laws like DMCA 1201 incentivize DRM by promising the power to control competition, but DRM's worst harms are in the realm of security. When the W3C published EME, it bequeathed to the web an unauditable attack-surface in browsers used by billions of people for their most sensitive and risky applications. These browsers are also the control panels for the Internet of Things: the sensor-studded, actuating gadgets that can see us, hear us, and act on the physical world, with the power to boil, freeze, shock, concuss, or betray us in a thousand ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gadgets themselves have DRM, intended to lock our repairs and third-party consumables, meaning that everything from your toaster to your car is becoming off-limits to scrutiny by independent researchers who can give you unvarnished, unbiased assessments of the security and reliability of these devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a competitive market, you'd expect non-DRM options to proliferate in answer to this bad behavior. After all, no customer &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; DRM: no car-dealer ever sold a new GM by boasting that it was a felony for your favorite mechanic to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we don't live in an a competitive market. Laws like DMCA 1201 undermine the competition that might counter their worst effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies that fought DRM at the W3C -- browser vendors, Netflix, tech giants, the cable industry -- all trace their success to business strategies that shocked and outraged established industry when they first emerged. Cable started as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/04/save-comcast&quot;&gt;unlicensed businesses that retransmitted broadcasts and charged for it&lt;/a&gt;. Apple's dominance started with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/04/save-itunes&quot;&gt;ripping CDs and ignoring the howls of the music industry&lt;/a&gt; (just as Firefox got where it is by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/04/save-firefox&quot;&gt;blocking obnoxious ads&lt;/a&gt; and ignoring the web-publishers who lost millions as a result). Of course, Netflix's revolutionary red envelopes were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/04/save-netflix&quot;&gt;treated as a form of theft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These businesses started as pirates and became admirals, and treat their origin stories as legends of plucky, disruptive entrepreneurs taking on a dinosauric and ossified establishment. But they treat any disruption aimed at &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; as an affront to the natural order of things. To &lt;a href=&quot;https://whitmansyawp.wordpress.com/2016/04/13/douglas-adams-quote-technology-rules/&quot;&gt;paraphrase Douglas Adams&lt;/a&gt;, any technology invented in your adolescence is amazing and world-changing; anything invented after you turn 30 is immoral and needs to be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;LESSONS FROM THE W3C&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people don't understand the risks of DRM. The topic is weird, technical, esoteric and take too long to explain. The pro-DRM side wants to make the debate about piracy and counterfeiting, and those are easy stories to tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But people who want DRM don't really care about that stuff, and we can prove it: just ask them if they'd be willing to promise not to use the DMCA unless someone is violating copyright, and watch them squirm and weasel about why policing copyright involves shutting down competitive activities that don't violate copyright. Point out that they didn't even question &lt;em&gt;whether&lt;/em&gt; someone could break their DRM, because, of course, DRM is so technologically incoherent that it only works if it's against the law to understand how it works, and it can be defeated just by looking closely at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask them to promise not to invoke the DMCA against people who have discovered defects in their products and listen to them defend the idea that companies should get a veto over publication of true facts about their mistakes and demerits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These inconvenient framings at least establish what we're fighting about, dispensing with the disingenuous arguments about copyright and moving on to the real issues: competition, accessibility, security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This won't win the fight on its own. These are still wonky and nuanced ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing we've learned from 15-plus years fighting DRM: it's easier to get people to take notice of &lt;em&gt;procedural&lt;/em&gt; issues than &lt;em&gt;substantive&lt;/em&gt; ones. We labored in vain to get people to take notice of the Broadcasting Treaty, a bafflingly complex and horribly overreaching treaty from WIPO, a UN specialized agency. No one cared until someone started stealing piles of our handouts and &lt;a href=&quot;https://boingboing.net/2011/07/07/wipos-broadcast-trea.html&quot;&gt;hiding them in the toilets so no one could read them&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; was global news: it's hard to figure out what something like the Broadcast Treaty is about, but it's easy to call shenanigans when someone tries to hide your literature in the toilet so delegates don’t see the opposing view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it was that four years of beating the drum about DRM at the W3C barely broke the surface, but when we resigned from the W3C over the final vote, everyone sat up and took notice, asking how they could help fix things. The short answer is, &quot;It's too late: we resigned because we had run out of options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the long answer is a little more hopeful. EFF is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-lawsuit-takes-dmca-section-1201-research-and-technology-restrictions-violate&quot;&gt;suing the US government&lt;/a&gt; to overturn Section 1201 of the DMCA. As we proved at the W3C, there is no appetite for making DRM unless there's a law like DMCA 1201 in the mix. DRM on its own does nothing except provide an opportunity for competitors to kick butt with innovative offerings that cost less and do more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Copyright Office is about to hold &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/09/once-again-were-asking-copyright-office-protect-your-right-fix-study-secure-remix&quot;&gt;fresh hearings&lt;/a&gt; about DMCA 1201.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The W3C fight proved that we could shift the debate to the real issues. The incentives that led to the W3C being colonized by DRM are still in play and other organizations will face this threat in the years to come. We'll continue to refine this tactic there and keep fighting, and we'll keep reporting on how it goes so that you can help us fight. All we ask is that you keep paying attention. As we learned at the W3C, we can't do it without you.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;This WebGL experiment is an attempt to create a procedural city that feels alive and is fun to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we generate a finite grid of random city blocks. Then, using some tricks, the viewpoint wraps around this grid, which creates the illusion of an endless cityscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Made with: Three.js, Blender, Unity.&lt;br/&gt;Models by SimplePoly.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>WeWork is going to acquire Meetup</title>
<link>https://news.crunchbase.com/news/wework-acquire-meetup/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://news.crunchbase.com/news/wework-acquire-meetup/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;WeWork’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/search/acquisitions/field/organizations/num_acquisitions/wework&quot;&gt;acquisition spree&lt;/a&gt; continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wework&quot;&gt;WeWork&lt;/a&gt; will acquire Meetup, &lt;em&gt;Crunchbase News&lt;/em&gt; has learned, adding another purchase to the rapidly expanding rental startup’s roster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $20 billion coworking space pioneer is set to acquire New York City-based community platform Meetup, according to an internal Meetup meeting that took place today. Meetup CEO and co-founder Scott Heiferman announced the move internally, telling employees “we are being acquired by WeWork.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow Crunchbase News on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/crunchbasenews&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/crunchbasenews&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company-wide meeting comes after weeks of internal speculation concerning the long-running independent startup’s direction. Internal records at Meetup hinted at the deal in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meetup declined to comment. WeWork declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meetup hasn’t taken part in a funding event &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/meetup&quot;&gt;since 2014&lt;/a&gt;, and it has, over the years, only taken about $19 million in investments according to Crunchbase. Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ) led two of its rounds, participating in the rest, also according to Crunchbase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEO Heiferman also said the acquisition would allow the firm to double in size. In the same meeting, he mentioned a $30 million figure. It was not clear if that was an acquisition price, or a reference to expected investment into his company from the acquiring entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The startup, which has 35 million Meetup members and over 300,000 “IRL” community meetups to date, is still hiring for several jobs, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/jobs/&quot;&gt;according to its website. &lt;/a&gt;However, the acquisition also comes on the heels of several Meetup employees being asked to voluntarily resign, which was confirmed to Crunchbase News by an internal source on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Crunchbase data, WeWork and Meetup do not share investors. The official acquisition announcement is expected to come tomorrow morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, WeWork has raised close to $10 billion, including $4.4 billion in a private equity round last August. The company has recently purchased the Lord &amp;amp; Taylor flagship store and New York-based coding academy Flatiron School.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share this story&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/236987486?color=ff9933&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Canonical's video introduction to Ubuntu 17.10&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;If you've been following the Linux world at all, you know this has been an entire year for spring cleaning. Early in 2017, Canonical stopped work on its homegrown Unity desktop, Mir display server, and its larger vision of &quot;convergence&quot;—a unified interface for Ubuntu for phones, tablets, and desktops.
&lt;p&gt;And now almost exactly six years after Ubuntu first switched from GNOME 2 to the Unity desktop, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/04/ubuntu-unity-is-dead-desktop-will-switch-back-to-gnome-next-year/&quot;&gt;that has been dropped, too&lt;/a&gt;. The distro is back to GNOME, and Canonical recently released Ubuntu 17.10, a major update with some significant changes coming to the popular Ubuntu Linux operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;In light of the GNOME switch, this release seems like more of a homecoming than an entirely new voyage. But that said, Ubuntu 17.10 simultaneously feels very much like the start of a new voyage for Ubuntu. The last few Ubuntu desktop releases have been about as exciting as OpenSSH releases—you know you need to update, but beyond that, no one really cares. Sure, there have been a few feature updates with each new numeric increment, perhaps some slightly more up-to-date GNOME and GTK components under the hood. But by and large, Ubuntu's Unity 7 desktop has been in maintenance mode for several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That period of stagnation turned Ubuntu from one of the more interesting operating systems around into just another Linux distro barely worthy of mention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trend changes with 17.10. There are big changes—an entirely new default desktop in fact—but this release feels different not because the desktop has changed, but because Ubuntu feels like it once again has a sense of focus and direction. Even Canonical's letter-based naming scheme has arrived at a starting over point: &quot;Artful Aardvark&quot; is 17.10's nickname.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Desktop despondency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desktop users paying close attention to Ubuntu may not like the renewed sense of focus and direction since much of the chatter, features, and tools coming out of Canonical right now are geared toward the server, container, and what the kids call the Internet of things (IoT) releases. While it's true that's where Canonical's bottom line lies (and without giving some attention to its paying customers there won't be a Canonical), that ignores the fact that Canonical put tremendous effort into transitioning away from Unity and building a replacement desktop out of GNOME. If Canonical really didn't care about the desktop, it wouldn't have put in any effort at all. It would have been much easier to just get rid of the desktop entirely, but that's not what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/1518&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; announcing 17.10, Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth encourages users to &quot;pick a desktop.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We're using GNOME,&quot; he writes, &quot;but we're the space where KDE and GNOME and MATE and many others come together to give users real and easy choice of desktops. And if you're feeling boned by the lack of Unity in open source, you might want to hop onto the channel and join those who are updating Unity7 for the newest X and kernel graphics in 18.04.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last bit hints at the future of desktop Ubuntu; so does a recent call for community input on a new Ubuntu desktop theme. These messages point to a new Ubuntu desktop, one that's much more community-centric. Canonical got rid of most of its design team, so in one sense it has no choice but to farm these things out to the community. But that's not the entire story here. This is pure conjecture on my part, but I think Canonical's course reversal on &quot;convergence&quot; goes much deeper than just abandoning Unity. Canonical shows signs of also abandoning its sometimes rather rigid belief system as well. Gone are the days when feature requests were dismissed as &quot;won't fix&quot; simply because they conflicted with some designer's vision of how the desktop should work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I believe that Ubuntu realized its mistake wasn't just pursuing convergence, but that convergence wasn't what its users wanted. I believe that the new Canonical, the new Ubuntu, is going to listen more closely to its community. I also think that the desktop release will eventually be spun off as a community-driven product only loosely affiliated with Canonical. Shuttleworth has already said Canonical is prepping for an IPO, hence the focus on money-making uses of Ubuntu (embedded, server, etc.). If that happens, the desktop will very likely slide to the side. There's plenty of prior art here—think Fedora and Red Hat, OpenSUSE and SUSE—and that's not necessarily at bad thing. In fact, it can be &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. Keeping things separate allows the desktop to develop and grow largely independent of Canonical's bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So 17.10 is a major release for Ubuntu not just because it's a brand-new desktop experience for users, but also because it's likely a preview of what's coming in the next Long Term Support release (Ubuntu 18.04, coming April 2018).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ubuntu-17.10-gnome&quot;&gt;Ubuntu 17.10 GNOME&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Unity desktop is gone, rather it's &quot;available in the archives,&quot; which is to say it's gone for all but the diehard fans looking for an obscure cause to get behind. Instead Ubuntu 17.10 boots into GNOME Shell by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you log in to 17.10, you'll notice that it doesn't look all that different from the last release. Ubuntu's developers have put considerable effort into making GNOME cosmetically similar to Unity. Unfortunately, in some important ways, the similarities are only skin deep. Much of Unity's appeal was in the small things that greatly improved its usability relative GNOME, for example the keyboard-driven HUD, the global menu, the nice notification system, and several other innovations present in Unity are also &quot;available in the archives,&quot; which is to say, they're gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much this matters to your experience with Ubuntu 17.10 depends on how much you used any of these things and how well GNOME plugins can mimic them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
Let's start with the bad news: your transition to GNOME will be painful if you were a heavy user of the HUD features in Unity. There is no GNOME plugin to pick up the slack (there are some admirable efforts underway, but in my testing none of them was ready for prime time). Worse, this is the kind of feature request that will have you hounded right off the GNOME developer mailing list, so don't even bother. GNOME will never have a HUD; undo your muscle memory and move on, or stick with &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/05/ubuntu-17-04-review-this-is-unitys-true-swan-song/&quot;&gt;Ubuntu 17.04&lt;/a&gt; until it reaches end of life in 2022.
&lt;p&gt;If the HUD wasn't your go-to tool in Unity, then the transition to GNOME will be less painful. In fact, most of what Unity could do can be imitated with GNOME plugins. Want Ubuntu-style notifications and indicators? There's &lt;a href=&quot;https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/&quot;&gt;an extension&lt;/a&gt; for that. Want a Global Menu? There's &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lestcape/Global-AppMenu&quot;&gt;an extension&lt;/a&gt; for that as well, but alas, it doesn't really work.

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The GNOME topbar menus (composite screenshot).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Ubuntu 17.10 is at least visually similar to its predecessors, which helps smooth the transition to GNOME somewhat. And since Unity was built on top of the same GTK libraries, GNOME components, and GNOME apps, most of the apps and interfaces you'll see and need to find in Ubuntu 17.10 are either identical or very similar to their Unity counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, however, even the familiar will feel a little strange. Files, the default GNOME file manager app, is a good example of this. For Unity 7, Ubuntu used an older version of Files and heavily patched it to add some functionality that had long since been deleted by the GNOME developers. With 17.10, Files is up to date, and those features are gone. One thing that Ubuntu did manage to hack in there is support for the desktop as a place to put stuff. The GNOME developers apparently consider the desktop just a wallpaper display tool, but with Ubuntu you can actually put launchers, folders, and files on your desktop. That should be welcome news for many Ubuntu users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top bar in GNOME behaves a little differently than the top bar in Unity. It has app indicators, status messages, network controls, and user sessions like Unity, but the top bar also adds a different app menu, a calendar applet in the center of the screen. There's also something like a global menu, minus the menu. When apps are maximized, the name of the app appears in the top menu along with one item menu (quit is generally your only option). A couple of apps have a few extra items in their menus—Terminal and Files for example—but it's a far cry from Unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's one other thing you'll notice in this release: the window management buttons are back on the right side of each title bar. Back when Unity first arrived, Ubuntu moved the buttons to the left (or wrong) side of the window in the name of innovation. Actually, there was a pretty good reason for the change. When you made a window full screen in Unity, the buttons became part of the top bar, and you can't do that when buttons are on the right side. But with the unified top bar now a thing of the past, there's no reason to have the buttons on the left side. If you really liked them over there, you can change the setting in the GNOME Tweak tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you get past the differences with Unity, there's much to like about this release. GNOME Shell is different from Unity, but it's not necessarily worse. It's certainly a pretty desktop, especially if you swap out the default theme that ships with 17.10 for something a little sleeker (I happen to like the dark variant of the Arc theme), something Ubuntu itself is planning to do before 18.04 LTS arrives. The default GNOME apps are generally the same as what you had in 17.04, but as noted above, some are quite a bit newer (Files and Terminal are the most notable of those).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those already well familiar with GNOME, Ubuntu 17.10 ships with GNOME 3.26, which is notable for its improved, streamlined search view, a new settings app (called Control Center rather than Settings), and full text search support for Files. There's also an interesting feature buried in the GNOME Web app: the GNOME browser no one uses. It now supports Firefox Sync, which means you can sync your bookmarks, history, passwords, and open tabs between Firefox and Web. So if you want to see what Web is like, now you can at least do it and keep everything you've got set up in Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, what you get with GNOME in 17.10 is close enough to Unity that it doesn't take more than a couple of days to wrap your head around the differences and get on with your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that in my testing, GNOME uses slightly more RAM and CPU than Unity on the same hardware doing the same things. The increase is only about 10 percent more on the RAM, and, let's face it, neither of them are lightweight desktops. If you want something light, try i3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’re aware of Netflix. Maybe you even have a subscription for their services. You might have also heard of or watched a series called &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;, produced by Netflix. But did you know that Netflix has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.target.com/p/-/A-52823816?lnk=Season1BlurayDV&amp;amp;clkid=1807817bN50a95209963b431df937f3b0&amp;amp;lnm=81938&amp;amp;afid=Skimbit%20Ltd.&amp;amp;ref=tgt_adv_xasd0002&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;selling a Collector’s Edition box set&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; that incorporates pictures from my webpage, &lt;a href=&quot;http://goughlui.com/the-vhs-corner/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The VHS Corner&lt;/a&gt;? I didn’t, until some kind netizens contacted me to tell me all about it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Tip-Off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was contacted at 7:56 am on November 5th, 2017, by the operator of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwMCfqdbS2PxHIFcwgIlcag&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;discjunkietv&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube. He reported posting a video online about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.target.com/p/-/A-52823816?lnk=Season1BlurayDV&amp;amp;clkid=1807817bN50a95209963b431df937f3b0&amp;amp;lnm=81938&amp;amp;afid=Skimbit%20Ltd.&amp;amp;ref=tgt_adv_xasd0002&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; Season 1 Target-exclusive Special Edition Blu-Ray Box Set&lt;/a&gt; and that a commenter (DVD and Film Bloke) had recognized that the images on the inner box resembling a VHS cassette are taken from my &lt;a href=&quot;http://goughlui.com/the-vhs-corner/intro-inside-the-vhs-cassette-vcr/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Intro – Inside the VHS Cassette &amp;amp; VCR&lt;/a&gt; page. After a quick confirmation, he decided to contact me about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Proof&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the help of discjunkietv, I had good quality images of the inner box. Initially, I only knew that the top-side had been taken, but it turns out that the underside was also sourced from my website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/box-cropped-800x533.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-295315&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/box-cropped-800x533.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/box-cropped-320x213.jpg 320w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/box-cropped-450x300.jpg 450w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/box-cropped-300x200.jpg 300w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/box-cropped-120x80.jpg 120w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/box-cropped.jpg 1278w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;The cover design of the Stranger Things collector’s edition boxed set. &lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/DSC_1864-800x444.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;444&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-295320&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/DSC_1864-800x444.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/DSC_1864-320x178.jpg 320w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/DSC_1864.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;My photo of a VHS cassette.
&lt;p&gt;Note the identical dirt in the flip-open tape cover, identical molding defect in the top-left area, identical reel positioning, and reflections. The image had been altered to fit the desired aspect ratio through cloning several rows of the pattern in both top and bottom areas, with the bottom corner filled in. They have also added their own “faux” labels on top of the center portion and right reel window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/bottom-face.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;568&quot; height=&quot;370&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-295317&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/bottom-face.jpg 568w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/bottom-face-320x208.jpg 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px&quot;/&gt;The back design of the boxed set. &lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/backside-800x444.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;444&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-295319&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/backside-800x444.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/backside-320x178.jpg 320w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/backside.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;My photo of a VHS cassette.
&lt;p&gt;Note the virtually identical image down to the offset of the reel-hubs in their respective apertures. Again, some modifications were made to fit the desired aspect ratio, but the images are essentially identical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/spine-face.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;660&quot; height=&quot;120&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-295321&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/spine-face.jpg 660w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/spine-face-320x58.jpg 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/edge-face.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;540&quot; height=&quot;134&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-295322&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/edge-face.jpg 540w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/edge-face-320x79.jpg 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I could not identify the source of the spine and side images based on the given pictures, however, it seems at least that the side may not have come from my website directly. It does bear resemblance to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://goughlui.com/the-vhs-corner/vhs-cassette-library/fuji-ag/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Fuji AG grade&lt;/a&gt; cassette side which I had imaged at an oblique angle. These may not be my images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As proof that I am the originator of the said images, here are two screenshots showing the metadata from the raw NEF from the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/metadata-800x775.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;775&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-295323&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/metadata-800x775.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/metadata-320x310.jpg 320w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/metadata.jpg 946w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/metadata2-800x780.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;780&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-295324&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/metadata2-800x780.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/metadata2-320x312.jpg 320w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/metadata2.jpg 938w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a double-check, a friend sent a link &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/10/17/stranger-things-gets-coolest-home-video-target/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;to photos posted by Jeremy Konrad&lt;/a&gt; as independent verification of the images above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a later date, I was also informed that the upcoming 4k UHD release with different outer-cover art will also have an inner box using the same base images, as shown in &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/gallery/5NFYE&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;this Imgur gallery by rpvee&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Reaction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I was in disbelief for two reasons. I’ve not watched &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;, but I’ve heard a lot of good things about it. Could it be true that my work has become a part of their product and I should be so honored to be part of it? The images I were seeing did not lie. They were my photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it turned into a feeling of betrayal. How could they, a large corporate company with day-to-day experience in handling rights-protected materials, use my material without so much as asking me for permission? How did they think they can get away with it? I’ll admit, I’m not a lawyer, but I do have a moral right to copyright over the images I take that does not require any registration. At the least, they have chosen my images because they are somehow special (e.g. well taken, high resolution), and I deserve to be compensated for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Attempted Contact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 9:08 am on the same day I learned all of this, I set about trying to contact Netflix about it. Contacting Netflix is hardly an easy task as no e-mail addresses are available, so I had to resort to live-chat to try and get to someone who can help. This was a long process, as it took about 10-15 minutes for the customer service representative to find the necessary contact details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You: I would like to contact your distribution department, as I have been made aware that the image of a VHS cassette used on the Target-exclusive Stranger Things Season 1 Collector’s Edition Blu-Ray is my image from my website (goughlui.com) and the image was used without my consent or permission.I would like to know how this came to happen, why I was not made aware of this and appropriate licensing sought prior to publication. Sincerely,Dr. Gough Lui&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shelton Netflix&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you Dr. Lui for letting us know about this concern , your opinion is very important for us,please, bear with me one minute so I can get you the right information about who to contact so we can get this solved for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shelton Netflix&lt;/strong&gt;: So welcome!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shelton Netflix&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you so much for you time and patience, I’m still retrieving the right information for you so you can get your concern clarify. one more minute please.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&lt;/strong&gt;: No problems. Understood :).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shelton Netflix&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you once again for your time, I did research about your concern and since we are not able to handle this issue over the chat I found the right department that can surely better assist you so you can get all the responses about this inconvenience, please address your concern to **************.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shelton Netflix&lt;/strong&gt;: And once again I apologize for this issues 🙁&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&lt;/strong&gt;: Thanks for the information. In the future, it would be easier if an e-mail address of some sort could be more prominently available under your contact details so I don’t have to “bother someone” to find it for me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&lt;/strong&gt;: Thanks again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shelton Netflix&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you muc for having the time to reach out to us, and will pass that feedback also. Have a great weekend&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shelton Netflix&lt;/strong&gt;: And one more thing, if you wouldn’t mind, please stay online for a one question survey.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being given the e-mail address for the Public Relations team, I sent off this e-mail at 9:29 am:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;44.923900789177&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Netflix,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been made aware that your recently-released Target-exclusive Stranger Things Season 1 Blu-Ray Collector’s Edition Box features a prominent image of a VHS cassette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Inline Image – Same as in Proof Section Above]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has come to my attention through a number of fans of Stranger Things that the prominent image featured is my image that I had photographed and published on my personal website, specifically on [&lt;a href=&quot;http://goughlui.com/the-vhs-corner/intro-inside-the-vhs-cassette-vcr/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt;]. As a VHS aficionado, I have posted some of the better quality images available online which are frequent targets of image theft. I was not contacted about its use, nor was any licensing of the image sought. Given the prominent copyright notice printed in the footer on each page, I assert my moral right to copyright over this image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Inline Image – Same as in Proof Section Above]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When compared with my image, note the reflection in both VHS reel windows, dirt in the VHS cover lid and “chip” in the patterning on the left side, all of which coincide at a level beyond just mere coincidence to indicate this image is indeed the one I had taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case of dispute, I do have the original un-edited RAW and JPG files, whose metadata is displayed below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Inline Image – Same as in Proof Section Above]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you are in the content production industry, the concept of copyright would not be foreign to you. I would like to know, specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who made the decision to use my image without permission, attribution nor contact?&lt;br/&gt;Who approved the artwork without reviewing any rights materials?&lt;br/&gt;How you propose to remedy this situation, as I am sure the discs themselves would see sizeable circulation for which I have not received any compensation for my efforts.&lt;br/&gt;I look forward to your co-operative response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gough Lui&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this was sent outside their regular operating hours, I didn’t expect an immediate reply, however, I did get an autoresponder at 9:50 am:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your message. If this is press-related, we do our best to respond to most media requests within a few hours. Please note: we do not monitor this inbox during weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your matter is regarding customer service, please refer to help.netflix.com for alternative contact information. We do not respond to customer service related issues through this email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is regarding a sponsorship request, someone will contact you if it’s of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are submitting a film for consideration: unfortunately, we do not accept or review unsolicited materials or ideas. For that reason, we will not consider any materials or ideas we receive that were not specifically requested by Netflix or submitted via an aggregator or established agent through the appropriate channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix PR Team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s clear from this reply that their system had received the e-mail. As a result, I sat and waited a few days. No reply was forthcoming. As a result, at 11:06 am on 8th November, I sent the following message (including a CC to my alternate e-mail address in case replies were lost):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Netflix,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was given this contact by your customer service team as the best contact to use, but I have not heard back from you in regards to my inquiry. Could you please acknowledge whether this inquiry is being handled, and as to the progress or whether there is a more appropriate contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has since come to my attention that the images used on the other sides of the collector’s edition box are also my images which were taken without obtaining permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would hope not to have to post an article on my website and go through social media channels to reach a resolution to this matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gough Lui&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message was successfully received on my alternate e-mail address, so the send did complete and no postmaster warnings were returned. However, it’s been over two weeks since my initial e-mail, and yet no reply has been entertained. It seems I am being ignored. As a result, I’ve had to do what I hate most — turn it into a social media “thing”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Happens Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am hoping that by making this public posting, at least this injustice is documented, with the hope that it catches the eye of someone responsible enough to look into the matter and offer appropriate compensation. When and if that happens, the record will be updated accordingly. Image licenses can frequently run up to $600 per image depending on use. In the case where people are not contacted beforehand, an additional penalty is considered customary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course, I have no ill intentions. I have no intention to ask them to stop selling the items. In fact, I’m happy people are nostalgic about VHS. I’m not looking to milk the situation at all. I’m not threatening to get a lawyer on their case. I’m just frustrated that I had to find out from someone else in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m frustrated that despite my photos being used, I’m not getting any compensation whatsoever. I’m frustrated that I have to spend time chasing when I could be spending time doing something else. I’m extremely frustrated that the piece of art they have produced resides on a box set which I cannot even hold in my own hands, as it’s US-only. I’m half-way around the world in Australia, so did they think they could get away with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topping it all off, once I tried to contact them via the means they have advised me to use, I was ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been unemployed for a while, on holidays for a while, making do as best as I can. I’m a one-man-band operating a personal blog that doesn’t even make AU$1/day after all the hosting and domain fees are considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not an unreasonable person – all I ask for is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;An apology and an explanation of how this happened, and what you’re doing about it. Maybe there is something I don’t know? If there is, then let me know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A reasonable license fee as a way to contribute to my work. This would go towards offsetting the cost of equipment and vast amount of time I’ve spent on my blog. I leave the monetary amount open to negotiation, but I’m trusting that you will at least be reasonable. You’re using my images on work that is being sold for profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A physical copy of the items in question. It’s not particularly nice to have your work used on something that you can’t even hold in your own hands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, for a company that had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/17/15327840/netflix-earnings-report-q1-2017-subscribers-quarterly-release&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Quarter 1 profit in 2017 of $178 million&lt;/a&gt;, what I’m asking for is not even a rounding error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how about it, Netflix? You know how to reach me. You’ve already got my e-mails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated on 11/28/17 at at 1:10 pm&lt;/strong&gt;: I thank everyone for their attention, time and support. It has been very overwhelming. As of 12:30pm (UTC+11) while I was away from the desk, I received a reply from Netflix. The reply reads as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lui,&lt;br/&gt;First, my sincerest apologies that no one has gotten back to you until now.&lt;br/&gt;Your blog post was brought to my attention so I wanted to reach out and let you know that we’re currently looking into this matter with the creative agency that worked on the product design for the tapes.&lt;br/&gt;Will update you as I know more. Feel free to reach out in the meantime.&lt;br/&gt;Best,&lt;br/&gt;Marlee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is not a resolution as of yet, it’s exactly what I wanted to hear – that someone is looking into the matter. I have since responded with a short message to thank them for their reply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Ms. Tart,&lt;br/&gt;My sincere thanks for your reply and thanks for following up on this matter. I look forward to hearing from you as to the outcome of your investigation.&lt;br/&gt;In the meantime, the blog post has been updated to reflect this recent communication as a matter of transparency.&lt;br/&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Gough Lui&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again to everyone for their support, and I will keep you updated should any further developments arise.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Woman offers WaPo false tale about Roy Moore in effort to discredit the paper</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content inline-video&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;inline-video-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;Reporter Stephanie McCrummen of The Washington Post interviews Jaime Phillips at a Greek restaurant in Alexandria on Wednesday. (Dalton Bennett,Thomas LeGro/The Washington Post)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman who falsely claimed to The Washington Post that Roy Moore, the Republican U.S. Senate candidate in Alabama, impregnated her as a teenager appears to work with an organization that uses deceptive tactics to secretly record conversations in an effort to embarrass its targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a series of interviews over two weeks, the woman shared a dramatic story about an alleged sexual relationship with Moore in 1992 that led to an abortion when she was 15. During the interviews, she repeatedly pressed Post reporters to give their opinions on the effects that her claims could have on Moore’s candidacy if she went public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Post did not publish an article based on her unsubstantiated account. When Post reporters confronted her with inconsistencies in her story and an Internet posting that raised doubts about her motivations, she insisted that she was not working with any organization that targets journalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on Monday morning, Post reporters saw her walking into the New York offices of Project Veritas, an organization that targets the mainstream news media and left-leaning groups. The organization sets up undercover “stings” that involve using false cover stories and covert video recordings meant to expose what the group says is media bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James O’Keefe, the Project Veritas founder who was convicted of a misdemeanor in 2010 for using a fake identity to enter a federal building during a previous sting, declined to answer questions about the woman outside the organization’s offices on Monday morning shortly after the woman walked inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am not doing an interview right now, so I’m not going to say a word,” O’Keefe said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content inline-video&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;inline-video-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;James O’Keefe, the founder of Project Veritas, declined to answer questions from The Post. (Aaron Davis/The Washington Post)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a follow-up interview, O’Keefe declined to answer repeated questions about whether the woman was employed at Project Veritas. He also did not respond when asked if he was working with Moore, former White House adviser and Moore supporter Stephen K. Bannon, or Republican strategists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group’s efforts illustrate the lengths to which activists have gone to try to discredit media outlets for reporting on allegations from multiple women that Moore pursued them when they were teenagers and he was in his early 30s. Moore has denied that he did anything improper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Moore’s campaign did not respond to a message seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman who approached Post reporters, Jaime T. Phillips, did not respond to calls to her cellphone later Monday. Her car remained in the Project Veritas parking lot for more than an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Post positioned video reporters outside the group’s office in Mamaroneck, N.Y, after determining that Phillips lives in Stamford, Conn., and realizing that the two locations were just 16 miles apart. Two reporters followed her from her home as she drove to the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Phillips was observed entering the Project Veritas office, The Post made the unusual decision to report her previous off-the-record comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We always honor ‘off-the-record’ agreements when they’re entered into in good faith,” said Martin Baron, The Post’s executive editor. “But this so-called off-the-record conversation was the essence of a scheme to deceive and embarrass us. The intent by Project Veritas clearly was to publicize the conversation if we fell for the trap. Because of our customary journalistic rigor, we weren’t fooled, and we can’t honor an ‘off-the-record’ agreement that was solicited in maliciously bad faith.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillips’s arrival at the Project Veritas office capped a weeks-long effort that began only hours after The Post published an article on Nov. 9 that included allegations that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/woman-says-roy-moore-initiated-sexual-encounter-when-she-was-14-he-was-32/2017/11/09/1f495878-c293-11e7-afe9-4f60b5a6c4a0_story.html?utm_term=.ca2d4b7a348f&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;Moore once initiated a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old named Leigh Corfman&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post reporter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/beth-reinhard/?utm_term=.66b196b39300&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;Beth Reinhard&lt;/a&gt;, who co-wrote the article about Corfman, received a cryptic email early the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Roy Moore in Alabama . . . I might know something but I need to keep myself safe. How do we do this?” the apparent tipster wrote under an account with the name “Lindsay James.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The email’s subject line was “Roy Moore in AL.” The sender’s email address included “rolltide,” the rallying cry of the University of Alabama’s sports teams, which are nicknamed the Crimson Tide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reinhard sent an email asking if the person was willing to talk off the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not sure if I trust the phone,” came the reply. “Can we just stick to email?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I need to be confident that you can protect me before I will tell all,” the person wrote in a subsequent email. “I have stuff I’ve been hiding for a long time but maybe it should stay that way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tipster’s email came amid counterattacks by Moore supporters aimed at The Post and its reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That same day, Gateway Pundit, a conservative site, spread a false story from a Twitter account, @umpire43, that said, “A family friend in Alabama just told my wife that a WAPO reporter named Beth offer her 1000$ to accuse Roy Moore.” The Twitter account, which has a history of spreading misinformation, has since been deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Post, like many other news organizations, has a strict policy against paying people for information and did not do so in its coverage of Moore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Nov. 14, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/11/14/alabama-pastor-says-man-posing-as-washington-post-reporter-offered-reward-for-dirt-on-roy-moore/?utm_term=.d051ed8bf4f4&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;pastor in Alabama said he received a voice mail&lt;/a&gt; from a man falsely claiming to be a Post reporter and seeking women “willing to make damaging remarks” about Moore for money. No one associated with The Post made any such call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the days that followed the purported tipster’s initial emails, Reinhard communicated with the woman through an encrypted text messaging service and spoke by phone with the person to set up a meeting. When the woman suggested a meeting in New York, Reinhard told her she would have to know more about her story and her background. The woman offered that her real name was Jaime Phillips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillips said she lived in New York but would be in the Washington area during Thanksgiving week and suggested meeting Tuesday at a shopping mall in Tysons Corner, Va. “I’m planning to do some shopping there so I’ll find a good place to meet before you get there,” Phillips wrote in a message sent via Signal, the encrypted messaging service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Reinhard suggested bringing another reporter, Phillips wrote, “I’m not really comfortable with anyone else being there this time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reinhard arrived to find Phillips, wearing a brown leather jacket and with long red hair, already seated in a booth in the restaurant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 41-year-old said &lt;span&gt;she had been abused as a child, Reinhard said. Her family had moved often. She said&lt;/span&gt; she moved in with an aunt in the Talladega area of Alabama and started attending a church youth group when she met Moore in 1992, the year he became a county judge. She said she was 15. She said they started a “secret” sexual relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I knew it wasn’t right, but I didn’t care,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said that she got pregnant, that Moore talked her into an abortion and that he drove her to Mississippi to get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interview, she told Reinhard that she was so upset she couldn’t finish her salad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillips said she had started thinking about coming forward after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/violence-threats-begging-harvey-weinsteins-30-year-pattern-of-abuse-in-hollywood/2017/10/14/2638b1fc-aeab-11e7-be94-fabb0f1e9ffb_story.html?utm_term=.6e14c6effffb&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;allegations about Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein surfaced&lt;/a&gt;. Then she said she saw the news about Moore flashing across the television screen while in a break room at her job at a company called NFM Lending in Westchester County, N.Y., Reinhard said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillips also repeatedly asked the reporter to guarantee her that Moore would lose the election if she came forward. Reinhard told her in a subsequent text message that she could not predict what the impact would be. Reinhard said she also explained to Phillips that her claims would have to be fact-checked. Additionally, Reinhard asked her for documents that would corroborate or support her story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that day, Phillips told Reinhard that she felt “anxiety &amp;amp; negative energy after our meeting,” text messages show. “You just didn’t convince me that I should come forward,” she wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reinhard replied, “I’m so sorry but I want to be straight with you about the fact-checking process and the fact that we can’t guarantee what will happen as a result of another story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillips was not satisfied. On Wednesday, the day before Thanksgiving, she suggested meeting with another Post reporter, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/stephanie-mccrummen/?utm_term=.82f007923db8&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;Stephanie McCrummen&lt;/a&gt;, who co-wrote the initial article about Corfman. “I’d rather go to another paper than talk to you again,” Phillips told Reinhard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at the newsroom, Reinhard became concerned about elements of Phillips’s story. Phillips had said she lived in Alabama only for a summer while a teenager, but the cellphone number Phillips provided had an Alabama area code. Reinhard called NFM Lending in Westchester County, but the company said a person named Jaime Phillips did not work there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice Crites, a Post researcher who was looking into Phillips’s background, found a document that strongly reinforced the reporters’ suspicions: a Web page for a fundraising campaign by someone with the same name. It was on the website GoFundMe.com under the name Jaime Phillips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-normal&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;unprocessed placeholder&quot; data-hi-res-src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/11/27/Investigative/Images/Croppedscreencapture-web-archive-org-web-20171122195050-https-www-gofundme-com-JaimeToNewYork-1511803913298.jpg?uuid=iR5ZotOkEee2Ldk0XO2JbQ&quot; data-low-res-src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_480w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/11/27/Investigative/Images/Croppedscreencapture-web-archive-org-web-20171122195050-https-www-gofundme-com-JaimeToNewYork-1511803913298.jpg?uuid=iR5ZotOkEee2Ldk0XO2JbQ&quot; data-raw-src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/11/27/Investigative/Images/Croppedscreencapture-web-archive-org-web-20171122195050-https-www-gofundme-com-JaimeToNewYork-1511803913298.jpg?uuid=iR5ZotOkEee2Ldk0XO2JbQ&quot; src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_60w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/11/27/Investigative/Images/Croppedscreencapture-web-archive-org-web-20171122195050-https-www-gofundme-com-JaimeToNewYork-1511803913298.jpg?uuid=iR5ZotOkEee2Ldk0XO2JbQ&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;The GoFundMe fundraising page. (Internet Archive)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m moving to New York!” the May 29 appeal said. “I’ve accepted a job to work in the conservative media movement to combat the lies and deceipt of the liberal MSM. I’ll be using my skills as a researcher and fact-checker to help our movement. I was laid off from my mortgage job a few months ago and came across the opportunity to change my career path.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a March posting on its Facebook page, Project Veritas said it was seeking 12 new “undercover reporters,” though the organization’s operatives use methods that are eschewed by mainstream journalists, such as misrepresenting themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A posting for the “journalist” job on the Project Veritas website that month warned that the job “is not a role for the faint of heart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job’s listed goal: “To adopt an alias persona, gain access to an identified person of interest and persuade that person to reveal information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also listed tasks that the job applicant should be able to master, including: “Learning a script,” “Preparing a background story to support your role,” “Gaining an appointment or access to the target of the investigation,” and “Operating concealed recording equipment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Veritas, founded in 2010, is a tax-exempt charity that says its mission is to “investigate and expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud and other misconduct.” It raised $4.8 million and employed 38 people in 2016, according to its public tax filing. It also had 92 volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O’Keefe’s criminal record has caused the charity problems in some states. Mississippi and Utah stripped the group of a license to raise money in those states because it failed to disclose O’Keefe’s conviction on state applications, records show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also working at Veritas is former television producer Robert J. Halderman, who was sentenced to six months in jail in 2010 after he was accused of trying to blackmail late-night host David Letterman. Halderman was with O’Keefe outside the Project Veritas offices Monday as a reporter tried to ask about Phillips’s role with the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Jaime Phillips is a relatively common name, it wasn’t a certainty that the GoFundMe page that Crites found was created by the same woman who approached The Post. But there was another telling detail, in addition to the name. One of two donations listed on the page was from a person whose name matched her daughter’s, according to public records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCrummen agreed to meet Phillips that afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillips suggested meeting somewhere in Alexandria, Va., saying she was shopping in the area. Post video reporters accompanied McCrummen, who brought a printout of the fundraising page to the interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, Phillips had arrived early and was waiting for McCrummen, her purse resting on the table. When McCrummen put her purse near Phillips’s purse to block a possible camera, Phillips moved hers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Post video reporters sat separately, unnoticed, at an adjacent table. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillips said she didn’t want to get into the details of what she had said happened between her and Moore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said she wanted McCrummen to assure her that the article would result in Moore’s defeat, according to a recording. McCrummen instead asked her about her story regarding Moore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillips complained that President Trump had endorsed Moore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So my whole thing is, like, I want him to be completely taken out of the race,” she said. “And I really expected that was going to happen, and now it’s not. So, I don’t know what you think about that.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCrummen asked Phillips to verify her identity with a photo identification. Phillips provided a Georgia driver’s license. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCrummen then asked her about the GoFundMe page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have a process of doing background, checking backgrounds and this kind of thing, so I wanted to ask you about one thing,” McCrummen said, pulling out a copy of the page and reading from it. “So I just wanted to ask you if you could explain this, and I also wanted to let you know, Jaime, that this is being recorded and video recorded.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Okay,” Phillips said. “Um, yeah, I was looking to take a job last summer in New York, but it fell through,” Phillips said. “Yeah, it was going to be with the Daily Caller, but it ended up falling through, so I wasn’t able to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked who at the Daily Caller interviewed her, Phillips said, “Kathy,” pausing before adding the last name, “Johnson.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;U1240902768811mmD&quot;&gt;Paul Conner, executive editor of the Daily Caller, said Monday that no one with the name Kathy Johnson works for the publication and that he has no record of having personally interviewed Phillips. Conner later said in an email that he had asked other top editors at the Daily Caller and the affiliated Daily Caller News Foundation about Phillips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“None of us has interviewed a woman by the name Jaime Phillips,” Conner wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Alexandria restaurant on Wednesday, Phillips also told The Post that she had not been in contact with the Moore campaign. As the interview ended, Phillips told McCrummen she was not recording the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think I probably just want to cancel and not go through with it at this point,” Phillips said at Souvlaki Bar shortly before ending the interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p channel=&quot;!Daily&quot;&gt;“I’m not going to answer any more questions,” she said. “I think I’m just going to go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She picked up her coat and bag, returned her drink to the front counter and left the restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 7 p.m. the message on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20171122195050/https:/www.gofundme.com/JaimeToNewYork&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;web.archive.org&quot;&gt;GoFundMe page&lt;/a&gt; was gone, replaced by a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Campaign is complete and no longer active,” it read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;inline-video-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;Post reporter Stephanie McCrummen, seen on the left, met with the woman who made false accusations against Roy Moore. Here is the full exchange. (Dalton Bennett,Thomas LeGro/The Washington Post)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<og:description>Jaime Phillips, who claimed to The Post that Moore impregnated her as a teenager, was seen on Monday walking into the headquarters of Project Veritas, a group that uses false cover stories and covert video recordings to expose what it says is media bias.</og:description>

<title>Facebook users in Romania see content related to street protests reviewed</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A series of Romanian bloggers, vloggers, journalists and other influencers alongside regular Facebook users said they had issues posting or sharing on Facebook content related to the street protests that took place on Sunday evening across the major cities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dragos Stanca, managing partner digital consultancy ThinkDigital, gathered on his Facebook page print screens from users who showed the messages they got from the social media behemoth. Among those hit by restrictions there were Facebook users posting live feeds from the protests and even those sharing media pieces about the marches. Some users weren’t able to share events created on Facebook for the street protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common notification from Facebook was that the post was under review to see if it breached the community standards. Other posts about the protests were suspected by Facebook of being spam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of Romanians &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.business-review.eu/featured/anti-judiciary-laws-protests-in-romania-tens-of-thousands-call-for-resignation-of-government-153178&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;marched in the main cities&lt;/a&gt;, asking the ruling coalition PSD-ALDE to drop controversial amendments to the judiciary. Around 20,000 took to the streets of Bucharest, also calling for the resignation of the center left government led by Mihai Tudose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some of the posts under review by Facebook.&lt;/h2&gt;

<title>American Equity</title>
<link>http://blog.samaltman.com/american-equity</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.samaltman.com/american-equity</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I’d like feedback on the following idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that every adult US citizen should get an annual share of the US GDP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that owning something like a share in America would align all of us in making the country as successful as possible—the better the country does, the better everyone does—and give more people a fair shot at achieving the life they want.  And we all work together to create the system that generates so much prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that a new social contract like what I’m suggesting here—where we agree to a floor and no ceiling—would lead to a huge increase in US prosperity and keep us in the global lead.  Countries that concentrate wealth in a small number of families do worse over the long term—if we don’t take a radical step toward a fair, inclusive system, we will not be the leading country in the world for much longer.  This would harm all Americans more than most realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are historical examples of countries giving out land to citizens (such as the Homestead Acts in the US) as a way to distribute the resources people needed to succeed.  Today, the fundamental input to wealth generation isn’t farmland, but money and ideas—you really do need money to make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Equity would also cushion the transition from the jobs of today to the jobs of tomorrow.  Automation holds the promise of creating more abundance than we ever dreamed possible, but it’s going to significantly change how we think about work.  If everyone benefits more directly from economic growth, then it will be easier to move faster toward this better world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default case for automation is to concentrate wealth (and therefore power) in a tiny number of hands.  America has repeatedly found ways to challenge this sort of concentration, and we need to do so again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint-stock company was one of the most important inventions in human history.  It allowed us to align a lot of people in pursuit of a common goal and accomplish things no individual could.  Obviously, the US is not a company, but I think a similar model can work for the US as well as it does for companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A proposal like this obviously requires a lot of new funding [1] to do at large scale, but I think we could start very small—a few hundred dollars per citizen per year—and ramp it up to a long-term target of 10-20% of GDP per year when the GDP per capita doubles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no delusions about the challenges of such a program.  There would be difficult consequences for things like immigration policy that will need a lot of discussion.  We’d also need to figure out rules about transferability and borrowing against this equity.  And we’d need to set it up in a way that does not exacerbate short-term thinking or favor unsustainable growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as the economy grows, we could imagine a world in which every American would have their basic needs guaranteed.  Absolute poverty would be eliminated, and we would no longer motivate people through the fear of not being able to eat.  In addition to being the obviously right thing to do, eliminating poverty will increase productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Equity would create a society that I believe would work much better than what we have today.  It would free Americans to work on what they really care about, improve social cohesion, and incentivize everyone to think about ways to grow the whole pie.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;[1] It’s time to update our tax system for the way wealth works in the modern world—for example, taxing capital and labor at the same rates.  And we should consider eventually replacing some of our current aid programs, which distort incentives and are needlessly complicated and inefficient, with something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this won’t solve all our problems—we still need serious reform in areas such as housing, education, and healthcare.  Without policies that address the cost of living crisis, any sort of redistribution will be far less effective than it otherwise could be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;p-2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruben Meerman&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Andrew Brown&lt;/strong&gt; explain why the answer might not be what you expect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-3&quot;&gt;Considering the soaring overweight and obesity rates and strong interest in this topic, there is surprising ignorance and confusion about the metabolic process of weight loss among the general public and health professionals alike. We encountered widespread misconceptions about how humans lose weight among general practitioners, dietitians, and personal trainers (fig 1&lt;a id=&quot;xref-fig-1-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-down-link&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7257#F1&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;⇓&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Most people believed that fat is converted to energy or heat, which violates the law of conservation of mass. We suspect this misconception is caused by the “energy in/energy out” mantra and the focus on energy production in university biochemistry courses. Other misconceptions were that the metabolites of fat are excreted in the faeces or converted to muscle. We present a novel calculation to show how we “lose weight.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Weight we want to “lose”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-5&quot;&gt;Excess carbohydrate or protein in the diet is converted to triglyceride and stored in the lipid droplets of adipocytes. Excess dietary fat needs no conversion other than lipolysis and re-esterification. People who wish to lose weight while maintaining their fat-free mass are, biochemically speaking, attempting to metabolise the triglycerides stored in their adipocytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-6&quot;&gt;The chemical formula for an average triglyceride molecule can be deduced from fatty acid composition studies. In 1960, Hirsch and colleagues published data that yield an “average fatty acid” with the formula C&lt;sub&gt;17.4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;33.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-1-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7257#ref-1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; This 50 year old result is in remarkable agreement with more recent data.&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-2-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7257#ref-2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; Three “average fatty acids” esterified to the glycerol backbone (+3C, +6H) give an “average triglyceride” with the formula C&lt;sub&gt;54.8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;104.4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. The three most common fatty acids stored in human adipose tissues are oleate (C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;34&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), palmitate (C&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and linoleate (C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;),&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-1-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7257#ref-1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-2-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7257#ref-2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; which all esterify to form C&lt;sub&gt;55&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;104&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-7&quot;&gt;The complete oxidation of a single triglyceride molecule involves many enzymes and biochemical steps, but the entire process can be summarised as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-8&quot;&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;55&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;104&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;+78O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;→55CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+52H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O+energy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-9&quot;&gt;Stoichiometry shows that complete oxidation of 10 kg of human fat requires 29 kg of inhaled oxygen producing 28 kg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 11 kg of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. This tells us the metabolic fate of fat but remains silent about the proportions of the mass stored in those 10 kg of fat that depart as carbon dioxide or water during weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-10&quot;&gt;To calculate these values, we traced every atom’s pathway out of the body. The carbon and hydrogen atoms obviously depart as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, respectively. The fate of a triglyceride molecule’s six oxygen atoms is a conundrum solved in 1949 by Lifson and colleagues&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-3-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7257#ref-3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; They used labelled heavy oxygen (O&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;) to show that the oxygen atoms of body water and respiratory carbon dioxide are rapidly exchanged through the formation of carbonic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). A triglyceride’s six oxygen atoms will therefore be shared by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in the same 2:1 ratio in which oxygen exists in each substance. In other words, four will be exhaled and two will form water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;sec-2&quot; readability=&quot;20.895752895753&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Novel calculation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-11&quot;&gt;The proportion of a triglyceride molecule’s mass exhaled in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the proportion of its molecular weight (daltons) contributed by its 55 carbon atoms plus four of its oxygen atoms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-12&quot;&gt;(661 Da (C&lt;sub&gt;55&lt;/sub&gt;)+64 Da (O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;))/(861 Da (C&lt;sub&gt;55&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;104&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;))×100=84%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-13&quot;&gt;The proportion of mass that becomes water is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-14&quot;&gt;(105 Da (H&lt;sub&gt;104&lt;/sub&gt;)+32 Da (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;))/(861 Da (C&lt;sub&gt;55&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;104&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;))×100=16%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-15&quot;&gt;These results show that the lungs are the primary excretory organ for weight loss (fig 2&lt;a id=&quot;xref-fig-2-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-down-link&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7257#F2&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;⇓&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The water formed may be excreted in the urine, faeces, sweat, breath, tears, or other bodily fluids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lifting the veil on weight loss&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-17&quot;&gt;At rest, an average 70 kg person consuming a mixed diet (respiratory quotient 0.8) exhales about 200 ml of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in 12 breaths per minute.&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-4-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7257#ref-4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; Each of those breaths therefore excretes 33 mg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2,&lt;/sub&gt; of which 8.9 mg is carbon. In a day spent asleep, at rest, and performing light activities that double the resting metabolic rate, each for 8 hours, this person exhales 0.74 kg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; so that 203 g of carbon are lost from the body. For comparison, 500 g of sucrose (C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;) provides 8400 kJ (2000 kcal) and contains 210 g of carbon. Replacing one hour of rest with exercise that raises the metabolic rate to seven times that of resting by, for example, jogging, removes an additional 39 g of carbon from the body, raising the total by about 20% to 240 g. For comparison, a single 100 g muffin represents about 20% of an average person’s total daily energy requirement. Physical activity as a weight loss strategy is, therefore, easily foiled by relatively small quantities of excess food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-18&quot;&gt;Our calculations show that the lungs are the primary excretory organ for fat. Losing weight requires unlocking the carbon stored in fat cells, thus reinforcing that often heard refrain of “eat less, move more.” We recommend these concepts be included in secondary school science curriculums and university biochemistry courses to correct widespread misconceptions about weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;

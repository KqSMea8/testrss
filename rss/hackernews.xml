&lt;p&gt;In response to issues identified by external researchers, Intel has performed an in-depth comprehensive security review of our Intel® Management Engine (ME), Intel® Server Platform Services (SPS), and Intel® Trusted Execution Engine (TXE) with the objective of enhancing firmware resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, Intel has identified security vulnerabilities that could potentially place impacted platforms at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In response to issues identified by external researchers, Intel has performed an in-depth comprehensive security review of its Intel® Management Engine (ME), Intel® Trusted Execution Engine (TXE), and Intel® Server Platform Services (SPS) with the objective of enhancing firmware resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, Intel has identified several security vulnerabilities that could potentially place impacted platforms at risk. Systems using ME Firmware versions 11.0/11.5/11.6/11.7/11.10/11.20, SPS Firmware version 4.0, and TXE version 3.0 are impacted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Affected products:&lt;/strong&gt; 

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;6th, 7th &amp;amp; 8th Generation Intel® Core™ Processor Family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intel® Xeon® Processor E3-1200 v5 &amp;amp; v6 Product Family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intel® Xeon® Processor Scalable Family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intel® Xeon® Processor W Family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intel® Atom® C3000 Processor Family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apollo Lake Intel® Atom Processor E3900 series&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apollo Lake Intel® Pentium™&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celeron™ N and J series Processors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the items identified through the comprehensive security review, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to platform, Intel® ME feature, and 3rd party secrets protected by the Intel® Management Engine (ME), Intel® Server Platform Service (SPS), or Intel® Trusted Execution Engine (TXE).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes scenarios where a successful attacker could:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Impersonate the ME/SPS/TXE, thereby impacting local security feature attestation validity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load and execute arbitrary code outside the visibility of the user and operating system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cause a system crash or system instability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For more information, please see this Intel &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intel.com/SA-00086-Support&quot;&gt;Support article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Kansas runs one of the most secretive state governments</title>
<link>http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article184179651.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article184179651.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The statement was simple. Factual.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;A Kansas spokesperson was acknowledging that the state highway department didn’t have the money to rebuild a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kansascity.com/news/state/kansas/article183770421.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;dangerous stretch of Interstate 70&lt;/a&gt; that had been the scene of multiple wrecks and a grisly motorcycle fatality caught on video.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“KDOT has lost a lot of money over the last few years,” the spokesperson said. “There’s just no funding at this point.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Simple, yes. But in Gov. Sam Brownback’s cash-strapped administration, those were fighting words. Days later, the spokesperson was fired.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                        
    
    


&lt;p&gt;“Your article was the nail in my coffin for being the face of KDOT,” the spokesperson said in an email to The Kansas City Star.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                        
    
    
    
    
        
    

         &lt;p&gt;The terminated employee, who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal, had learned what it meant to cross the line — the one where the state of Kansas doesn’t discuss public business with Kansans.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Kansas runs one of the most secretive state governments in the nation, and its secrecy permeates nearly every aspect of service, The Star found in a months-long investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;From the governor’s office to state agencies, from police departments to business relationships to health care, on the floors of the House and Senate, a veil has descended over the years and through administrations on both sides of the political aisle.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“My No. 1 question to anybody who opts in favor of nondisclosure is, ‘What are you trying to hide from us?’&lt;span class=&quot;ng-command&quot; data-value=&quot;133&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ” said former Rep. John Rubin, a Johnson County Republican, calling Kansas “one of the most secretive, dark states in the country in many of these areas.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                        
    
    
    
    

                                        
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;What’s hidden are stories of regular Kansans who have suffered inside the silence.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;In the course of its investigation, The Star found that:&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ng_z_sym_square_bullet&quot;&gt;▪ &lt;/span&gt;Children known to the state’s Department for Children and Families suffer horrific abuse, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article184177786.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;while the agency cloaks its involvement with their cases&lt;/a&gt;, even shredding notes after meetings where children’s deaths are discussed, according to a former high-ranking DCF official. One grieving father told The Star he was pressured to sign a “gag order” days after his son was killed that would prevent him from discussing DCF’s role in the case. Even lawmakers trying to fix the troubled system say they cannot trust information coming from agency officials.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ng_z_sym_square_bullet&quot;&gt;▪ &lt;/span&gt;In the past decade, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article184176596.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;more than 90 percent of the laws&lt;/a&gt; passed by the Kansas Legislature have come from anonymous authors. Kansans often had no way of knowing who was pushing which legislation and why, and the topics have included abortion, concealed weapons and school funding. Kansas is one of only a few states that allow the practice.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ng_z_sym_square_bullet&quot;&gt;▪ &lt;/span&gt;When Kansas police shoot and kill someone, law enforcement agencies often escape scrutiny because they are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article184172776.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;allowed to provide scant details to the public&lt;/a&gt;. The release of body-cam video has become common practice around the country after several high-profile, police-involved shootings. But in Kansas, a new state law is one of the most restrictive in the nation, allowing agencies to shelve footage that could shed more light on controversial cases.&lt;/p&gt;

In some of those cases, caregivers later discovered their services had been dramatically cut.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;The examples, when stitched together, form a quilt of secrecy that envelops much of state government.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“Damn,” said Bob Stephan, a Republican and four-time Kansas attorney general. “That causes me concern. It’s very disheartening. … It’s gone crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;h3&gt;Secrecy from the top down&lt;span class=&quot;ng-command&quot; data-value=&quot;252&quot;/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Many lawmakers who have attempted more openness in government say accountability has withered in the Brownback era.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Sen. Anthony Hensley, a Topeka Democrat, has spent 41 years in the Legislature, making him the longest-serving lawmaker in Kansas history. He has served under eight governors — half of them Republicans, half Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“We’ve had a real problem with this current administration,” Hensley said. “This is the least transparent administration I have seen. To be able to even get basic information about issues like foster care and the corrections department, it’s next to impossible when you make an inquiry.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Rubin pushed for transparency — often in vain — during his time in Topeka from 2011 to 2016. He was one of the first two legislators to sign a pledge created last year by a group called Open Kansas.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;The pledge asked lawmakers to increase government accountability and transparency. Only 23 of the state’s 165 legislators signed the pledge during the 2016 session. After last November’s election, that number increased by 14 but still represented just 22 percent of the Legislature.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;It’s no wonder Kansas got a flunking grade in a 2015 study by the Center for Public Integrity that measured transparency and state accountability. Among its bad grades: F’s in public access to information, internal auditing and executive accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Though the state’s obsession with secrecy goes back decades, Brownback’s seven years as governor have been marked by efforts to shield executive decisions from the public.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;In 2012, the Shawnee County district attorney’s office concluded that private meetings Brownback held with lawmakers at the governor’s mansion technically violated the state’s open meetings act. Prosecutors determined the violations were a result of ignorance about the law and did not pursue penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Two years later, the state’s budget director used a private email address to share details of Brownback’s budget proposal with a pair of lobbyists who had close ties to the governor. The director shared the information several weeks before lawmakers saw it.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;In late 2014, Brownback appointed two additional members to the Saline County Commission but refused to release the names of the applicants. Two news organizations sued and the court eventually sided with Brownback. But five applicants came forward and identified themselves. The year before, Brownback had refused a request to identify applicants for a seat on the Kansas Court of Appeals, the state’s second-highest court.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;And last year, as Brownback’s office weighed budget cuts in the wake of massive tax reductions and huge revenue shortfalls, he refused to release financial documents that had been public under previous governors.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Critics say the governor also leaves behind a legacy of state agencies that avoid disclosure as a matter of policy.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;A current Kansas Department of Transportation employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, likened the central office in Topeka to the Pentagon.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“They (spokespeople) are told what they can and cannot say,” the employee said. “Their public relations people are just there for show.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;The spokesperson who was fired after talking about highway funding deficits was known within KDOT as a social media expert whose communication initiatives had built public respect for the agency, one former colleague said.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;The employee “was really the best public affairs manager that KDOT had,” said Martin Miller, who retired in 2015 as the spokesman for the department’s south-central Kansas district. “I would see Facebook posts, tweets, emailed press releases at 1 or 2 o’clock in the morning. (The terminated employee) did a great service for the residents of Kansas.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;The Star sent questions to Brownback’s office, including one asking whether anyone from KDOT had been disciplined for talking about funding issues. His office responded with a lengthy comment about transparency but did not answer the question about KDOT.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“Governor Brownback’s administration has always been sensitive to the fact that government is a public institution and that public institutions function best in the sunshine,” wrote Rachel Whitten, the governor’s interim spokeswoman, in an email Thursday. “He makes it a priority to remain open with the people he serves by answering thousands of media requests for comment, hundreds of open records requests, and signing numerous bills that increase transparency in state government.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“Public officials are required to balance transparency with many other considerations in the process of governing, including the law, and the privacy of private individuals who interact with the government, among a myriad of other important factors.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Many do not see it that way. The state, they say, seems hellbent on keeping information from the public.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“If you don’t have transparency in every aspect of the government, then you aren’t making it clear to people that the public’s business is being done in a forthright way,” said Doug Bonney, the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas. “It’s something about Kansas; I don’t know what it is exactly. But Kansas is overly worried about information becoming public.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“If it’s not the least transparent state in the Union, it’s close to it.”&lt;/p&gt;

                                    &lt;p&gt;Rumors had been running through Tonganoxie for days: Tyson Foods was coming.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;But residents didn’t know any details of the planned poultry plant. Not until the big announcement inside the Brunswick Ballroom in early September when state and county officials were on stage smiling and clapping.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;By then, much of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article171385947.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Tonganoxie was pissed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;This wasn’t just going to be a small plant. It would be a $320 million state-of-the art complex, slaughtering and packaging 1.25 million birds each week. Residents worried about the smell, contamination to the area and how their town and schools would handle a projected 1,600 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;City and county officials, along with Brownback, had been quietly working on a deal for months. A site was already picked. “Project Sunset,” it was called behind closed doors.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“This was a done deal. They said they were going to break ground in 90 days,” said Steve Skeet, whose parents own land across the road from where Tyson wanted to build. “They knew about this but didn’t tell anybody. Giving it a code name made it a dirty secret that they wanted to hide.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Residents heckled and jeered as the plans were revealed, and Skeet’s mom cried.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;In the end, the town’s uproar was heard loud and clear. Two weeks later, the Leavenworth County Commission reversed its support of the project and Tyson said it would explore other locations.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Project Sunset could have played out anywhere in Kansas, where privacy is as deeply rooted as the wheat fields covering the Sunflower State.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“In Kansas, I do think folks tend to be somewhat private people,” said Sen. Molly Baumgardner, a Louisburg Republican. “The majority of the state is rural and that small-town approach, that ‘Our business is our business and it’s not anyone’s business until we want to share it,’ tends to be the thought of the day.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Both Democrats and Republicans have run opaque administrations, said Burdett Loomis, who worked for former Democratic Gov. Kathleen Sebelius.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“Once you’ve got that lack of transparency, unless there’s something that rocks the boat, the people who benefit from it are perfectly happy to let it be,” said Loomis, a political science professor at the University of Kansas. “Corporations, lobbyists, lawmakers, a lot of these people have no reason to change anything very much.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;The culture that stifles transparency has become ingrained, said Benet Magnuson, executive director of Kansas Appleseed, a nonprofit justice center serving vulnerable and excluded Kansans.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“There’s something about once that culture sets in,” Magnuson said. “It’s really difficult to move out of.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Raised in Kansas, Magnuson went to Harvard and Harvard Law School before moving to Texas. There, he never encountered problems when requesting open records or information. Then he returned to Kansas.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“Moving back here, time after time, the first question that would be asked is, ‘Who are you and why are you asking for this?’&lt;span class=&quot;ng-command&quot; data-value=&quot;133&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;” Magnuson said. “In Kansas, I’m hesitant to say 100 percent, but it was close to 100 percent of the time that’s what you get — ‘who are you and what are you going to do with this?’&lt;span class=&quot;ng-command&quot; data-value=&quot;133&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;The Star asked more than a dozen counties how they were responding to a new law intended to open criminal affidavits.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;When it contacted Kurtis Jacobs in Finney County in southwest Kansas, the District Court administrator said he would not provide the information without first knowing the angle of the story. Or, he said, The Star could file an open records request.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“Under the Kansas Open Records Act (KORA), I can take three days to respond and then as long as I need to to get the information,” Jacobs said. “We can do this the easy way or we can do this the hard way.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Three months after receiving two requests from The Star regarding the deaths of an infant and a 10-year-old boy, the Department for Children and Families said it could not fulfill them.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Why? Because it didn’t have enough staffing resources “due to its current workload of KORA requests.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;h3&gt;Meeting behind closed doors&lt;span class=&quot;ng-command&quot; data-value=&quot;252&quot;/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Obtaining records and information isn’t the only obstacle regular citizens encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Kansas is one of four states that do not require public notice of all regular public meetings, according to a Star analysis of the 50 states’ open meetings laws. The Kansas Open Meetings Act only requires notice be given to individuals who have requested it.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;And Kansas and Arkansas are the only two states that do not require minutes to be kept of a public meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Since 2016, the Kansas attorney general’s office has filed seven enforcement actions against municipalities that have violated the two open government laws. In each case, those who broke the law were asked to take additional training and agree to not break the law again.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;The state also grants tax breaks worth hundreds of millions of dollars each year to lure businesses. Trouble is, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article184174741.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;you’ll never know who got those credits or how much&lt;/a&gt;. The state does what most states do not: It forbids the disclosure — even to lawmakers — of the recipients and how much they received. In Missouri and other states, that information is available online.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;It should be of little surprise then that Kansas has received D’s and F’s in several national studies about transparency over the years, including the 2015 Center for Public Integrity report where Kansas ranked with 10 states that scored F’s.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Some Kansans have fought to make the system more open.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Alan Cowles, a Lawrence physician, couldn’t find any record of his local health board or city or county commissions discussing a $750,000 lawsuit he knew about.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;That’s because, he discovered, when members went into closed session they didn’t list specific reasons why. That prompted him to survey the state’s 10 largest cities and counties and he found that all but one — the Manhattan City Commission — would close meetings without giving “meaningful information” about the subjects they were going to discuss.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;He found that they conducted at least 200 hours of government business behind closed doors.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“They were doing business in secrecy,” Cowles said. “What good is the open meetings act?”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;He worked with Sen. Marci Francisco, a Lawrence Democrat, and Baumgardner, the Louisburg Republican, to change the law and require boards to state the specific topics they plan to discuss in a closed meeting. The legislation went into effect July 1.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“The public ought to have some chance in knowing what these governmental bodies were talking about,” Cowles said.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Judith Deedy, a mother of three in Johnson County, is worried about lack of transparency in education policy.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;She is one of many Shawnee Mission School District parents who started paying closer attention to what happens in the state Capitol after budget cuts and other policy changes began affecting schools.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Deedy, executive director of the advocacy group Game On for Kansas Schools, recalled that a 2015 law changing education funding was “one of the wake-up calls.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“That was a really clear example to so many people that we had a Legislature that was not listening to us,” she said, “and by us I mean any supporters of public education.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;The bill that made block grants the source for school funding was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article184176596.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;a “gut-and-go” measure&lt;/a&gt; — a common practice in Topeka where legislators take a bill that has already passed one chamber, gut it and insert an unrelated bill. The maneuver clears the path for less public debate and easier passage.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“To us, it was absurd that something this important was getting rammed through so quickly,” Deedy said.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;h3&gt;How did your legislator vote?&lt;span class=&quot;ng-command&quot; data-value=&quot;252&quot;/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Aside from using “gut-and-go” measures and anonymous bills, lawmakers also can keep their votes from being disclosed to the public in committee meetings where much of the legislative work is done.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;House rules don’t require committee votes to be logged unless a member requests his or her vote be recorded. The Senate only requires that the number of votes for and against an action be recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;When former Rep. Rubin told his committee in 2013 that the votes of each member would be recorded, “I had a revolt on my hands.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Both Republicans and Democrats went to the House speaker, he said, and complained, asking how Rubin was allowed to do that. When the speaker said committee chairs have the power to require public votes, they asked to be removed from his committee.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;Rubin backed down but still had every one of his own votes recorded; he recalled only three or four other committee members following his lead.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“I’ve talked to legislators in other states and so did Legislative Research, and they’ve never heard of such a thing,” Rubin said.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;He said Topeka should not be a place for covert actions.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“The things we do in the Legislature affect people’s lives profoundly,” Rubin said. “People in Kansas have a right to know how their government operates and have the right to know about how decisions are arrived at that affect their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                
                                    &lt;p&gt;“People have no idea this stuff is going on.”&lt;/p&gt;

Growth editor Leah Becerra oversaw the online report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reporters spoke with about 100 people: current and former lawmakers of both parties, law enforcement and families of crime victims, state employees who had been demoted or fired for saying too much, caregivers for some of the state’s most vulnerable citizens, families of children whose deaths raised questions about the Department for Children and Families, and citizens frustrated by a lack of transparency in local and state government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For several months, reporters pored over decades of legislation. They analyzed state open meetings and records laws and compared them to other states. And they filed dozens of open records requests with police agencies to gauge the transparency of departments across the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Share your story&lt;span class=&quot;ng-command&quot; data-value=&quot;252&quot;/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you experienced secrecy in Kansas that has affected you or other citizens?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve had trouble getting records or documents in Kansas, felt cut out of Topeka’s legislative process or been stonewalled by state agencies, we want to hear from you.

<title>Modern Media Is a DoS Attack on Free Will</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://m.nautil.us/issue/52/the-hive/modern-media-is-a-dos-attack-on-your-free-will</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;t’s not that James Williams, a doctoral candidate at the Oxford Internet Institute’s Digital Ethics Lab (motto: “Every Bit as Good”), had a “God, what I have I done?” moment during his time at Google. But it did occur to him that something had gone awry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Williams joined Google’s Seattle office when it opened in 2006 and went on to win the company’s highest honor, the Founder’s Award, for his work developing advertising products and tools. Then, in 2012, he realized that these tools were actually making things harder for him. Modern technology platforms, he explained to me, were “reimposing these pre-Internet notions of advertising, where it’s all about getting as much of people’s time and attention as you can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.nautil.us/13224_bdd1b613ee6fcac7694cf648430358ce.png&quot; width=&quot;733&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2011, he had followed his literary and politico-philosophical bent (he is a fan of George Orwell’s &lt;em&gt;1984&lt;/em&gt; and Aldous Huxley’s &lt;em&gt;Brave New World&lt;/em&gt;) to Oxford, while still working at Google’s London office. In 2014, he co-founded Time Well Spent, a “movement to stop technology platforms from hijacking our minds,” according to its website. Partnering with Moment, an app that tracks how much time you spend in other apps, Time Well Spent asked 200,000 people to rate the apps they used the most—after seeing the screen time it demanded of them. They &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timewellspent.io/app-ratings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that, on average, the more time people spent in an app, the less happy they were with it. “Distraction wasn’t just this minor annoyance. There was something deeper going on,” he told me. “That’s why I came over here to start my Ph.D. on that stuff.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Williams has most recently been in the media spot light for his essay, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebookseller.com/news/james-williams-wins-100k-nine-dots-prize-560856&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stand Out of Our Light: Freedom and Persuasion in the Attention Economy&lt;/a&gt;,” which won the $100,000 Nine Dots Prize and scored him a book deal with Cambridge University Press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nautilus&lt;/em&gt; caught up with Williams to discuss the subversive power of the modern attention economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do the Internet and social media apps threaten democracy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democracy assumes a set of capacities: the capacity for deliberation, understanding different ideas, reasoned discourse. This grounds government authority, the will of the people. So one way to talk about the effects of these technologies is that they are a kind of a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the human will. Our phones are the operating system for our life. They keep us looking and clicking. I think this wears down certain capacities, like willpower, by having us make more decisions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/18/modern-world-bad-for-brain-daniel-j-levitin-organized-mind-information-overload&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A study&lt;/a&gt; showed that repeated distractions lower people’s effective IQ by up to 10 points. It was over twice the IQ drop that you get from long-term marijuana usage. There are certainly epistemic issues as well. Fake news is part of this, but it’s more about people having a totally different sense of reality, even within the same society or on the same street. It really makes it hard to achieve that common sense of what’s at stake that is necessary for an effective democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How have these technologies transformed news media?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s happened is, really rapidly, we’ve undergone this tectonic shift, this inversion between information and attention. Most of the systems that we have in society—whether it’s news, advertising, even our legal systems—still assume an environment of information scarcity. The First Amendment protects freedom of speech, but it doesn’t necessarily protect freedom of attention. There wasn’t really anything obstructing people’s attention at the time it was written. Back in an information-scarce environment, the role of a newspaper was to bring you information—your problem was lacking it. Now it’s the opposite. We have too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you get distracted by the same thing in the same way every day, it adds up to a distracted week, distracted months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does that change the role of the newspaper?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of the newspaper now is to filter, and help you pay attention to, the things that matter. But if the business model is like advertising, and a good article is an article that gets the most clicks, you get things like click bait because those are the metrics that are aligned with the business model. When information becomes abundant, attention becomes scarce. Advertising has dragged everybody down, even the wealthiest organizations with noble missions, to competing on the terms of click bait. Every week there are these outrage cascades online. Outrage is a rewarding thing to us, because it fulfills a lot of these psychological needs we have. It could be used to help us move forward, but often, they’re used to keep us clicking and scrolling and typing. One of the first books about web usability was actually called &lt;em&gt;Don’t Make Me Think&lt;/em&gt;. It’s this idea of appealing to our impulsive selves, the automatic part of us, and not the considerate, rational part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tristan Harris, with whom you co-founded Time Well Spent, said tech steers the thoughts of 2 billion people with more influence than the world’s religions or governments. Would you agree?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I would agree with that. I don’t know any comparable governmental or religious mechanism that’s anything comparable to the smart phone and social media, in the sense that people give so much attention to it, and it has such a frequency and duration of operation. I think it certainly intervenes at a lower level, closer to people’s attention than governmental or religious systems. I think it’s closer to being like a chemical, or a drug of some sort, than it is to being like a societal system. Snapchat has this thing called Snapstreak, for example, where it says, “Here’s how many days in a row you’ve taken a snapshot photo with someone.” You can brag to your friends how long you’ve gone. There’s a ton of these kinds of methods and non-rational biases—social comparison is a huge one. There’s a guy who wrote a book called &lt;em&gt;Hooked&lt;/em&gt;, Nir Eyal, where he teaches designers how to pull a user into a system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.nautil.us/13237_3f258712c3ba708ba78a60afde94352a.png&quot; width=&quot;733&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In your essay, you argue that the way these technologies indulge our impulsive selves breaks three kinds of attention necessary for democracy. What are they?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more a heuristic that I use. It’s not a scientific argument. First, the “spotlight” of attention is how cognitive scientists tend to talk about perceptual attention. The things that are task-salient in my environment. How I select and interact with those, basically. Second, the “starlight.” If the spotlight is about doing things, the starlight is &lt;em&gt;who I want to be&lt;/em&gt;, not just what I want to do. It’s like those goals that are valuable for their own sake, not because they’re instrumental toward some other goal. Also, over time, how we keep moving toward those, and how we keep seeing the connections between the tasks we’re doing right now, and those higher-level or longer-term goals. Third, the “daylight.” In the philosopher Harry Frankfurt’s terms, it’s wanting what you want to want—the domain of metacognition. Basically, if the “spotlight” and the “starlight” are about pursuing some goal, some end, some value, the “daylight” is about the capacities that enable us to discern and define what those goals, those ends, are to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s easy to see how persuasive tech disrupts our “spotlight” of attention. But what about the other two?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think one way, in general, is by the way it can create habits for us. If you get distracted by the same thing in the same way every day, it adds up to a distracted week, distracted months. Either by just force of repetition, or whatever, it has the effect of making us forget about those stars that we want to live by, or not reflect on them as much. We start taking lower level goals as having inherent value—essentially what pettiness as a phenomenon is. It’s the idea of, if my team wins, it doesn’t matter if the entire political climate becomes more toxic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are these technologies affecting our politics?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we’re seeing, at least across Western liberal democracies, is a pretty consistent move toward populist tendencies. It seems to me that the one thing that all these societies have in common is their major form of media. To me, that suggests that it’s what they all have in common that is amplifying it. It’s not new dynamics, but it’s supercharged in ways that we’ve never been able to supercharge it in the past. It’s hard for me to imagine that this sort of thing would be happening in the same way in the era of the telegraph or newspaper, even in television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But wasn’t radio criticized by print media for supercharging our anti-democratic tendencies back in the 1930s?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radio was a huge factor in Hitler’s rise to power. It’s why he put one in every house. I think that’s an interesting comparison. Marshall McLuhan, a Canadian media theorist, talked about this: He said, when a new technology comes out, and we still don’t know how to wrap our heads around it, there’s an initial period where our sensory ratios, our perception, is re-acclimating, a kind of a hypnosis moment. He makes the point that the hypnotic effect of Hitler’s style of oratory was amplified by the hypnotic effect of this new media, which is a type of information overload in people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choice is such a messy thing to dive deep into, because then you realize that nobody knows what it means to choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t we get used to new media technologies with time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think about how long we had to come to terms with the dynamics of radio, the telephone, etc., it was almost one to two human generations. As electric media has advanced more and more, the time to reach 150 million users accelerates. I think radio was like 60-something years, maybe, or 70, and television was maybe like 30 or 40. Today, for technology, like an app, to reach 150 million users, it could be a matter of days. I think what happens is that we never actually get to that place of stability and mastery of technology. We’re always in this learning curve of incompetence. We can use it well enough, but not so well that we can master it before the next thing comes along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isn’t it our own fault that we’re too easily distracted? Maybe we just need more self-discipline.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That kind of rhetoric implicitly grants the idea that it’s okay for technology to be adversarial against us. The whole point of technology is to help us do what we want to do better. Why else would we have it? I think part of the open door that these industries have walked through is the fact that, when we adopt a new technology, we don’t typically ask “What is it for?” If we were to ask what a smartphone is for, it would almost be a ridiculous question. It’s for whatever it can do now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does personal responsibility matter at all?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think personal responsibility is unimportant. I think it’s untenable as a solution to this problem. Even people who write about these issues day to day, even me—and I worked at Google for 10 years—need to remember the sheer volume and scale of resources that are going into getting us to look at one thing over another, click on one thing over another. This industry employs some of the smartest people, thousands of Ph.D. designers, statisticians, engineers. They go to work every day to get us to do this one thing, to undermine our willpower. It’s not realistic to say you need to have more willpower. That’s the very thing being undermined!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article-author&quot;&gt;By Alex Wright&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Earth may not be flat, but the web certainly is. “There is no ‘top’ to the World-Wide Web,” declared a 1992 foundational document from the World Wide Web Consortium—meaning that there is no central server or organizational authority...&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nautil.us/issue/21/Information/the-future-of-the-web-is-100-years-old&quot; class=&quot;obnd_lnk&quot; data-trval=&quot;the-future-of-the-web-is-100-years-old&quot; data-trlbl=&quot;foc_rec&quot; data-tract=&quot;internal_art&quot;&gt;READ MORE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think information technology is on our side?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the extent that the goal of the design is just to capture and keep our attention, it’s predominantly not on our side. If it’s not even equipped to know what our goals are a lot of the time, I don’t see how it can be. I think that kind of information exchange would be necessary for it to move in the right direction. One standard I use is GPS. If a GPS distracted us in physical space in the ways that other technologies distract us in informational space, no one would keep using that GPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do we get persuasive tech to stop indulging our impulsive selves?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that there are a lot of things that need to happen at the level of business model, regulation, corporate company organizational design and operation, prioritization. I think that one of the most important things we can do in the near term is come up with good ways of talking about the nature of the problem, because I think it’s harder to advocate for change without the right language. Sometimes it’s talked about in terms of distraction or attention, but we tend to associate that with more immediate types of attention, not longer-term life effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long will that take?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think it will happen overnight, because a lot of it involves changing the way we talk about human nature and interaction. So much of the way we talk about it, especially in the U.S., is rooted in discussions of freedom of choice. My intuition, and this is just intuition, is the more we can get away from talking about it in terms of choice and start talking about it in terms of chance—which outcome was preferable and which actually happened—the better. Choice is such a messy thing to dive deep into, because then you realize that nobody knows what it means to choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s one concrete thing companies could do now to stop subverting our attention?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would just like to know what is the ultimate design goal of that site or that system that’s shaping my behavior or thinking. What are they really designing my experience for? Companies will say that their goal is to make the world open and connected or whatever. These are lofty marketing claims. But if you were to actually look at the dashboards that they’re designing, the high-level metrics they’re designing for, you probably wouldn’t see those things. You’d see other things, like frequency of use, time on site, this type of thing. If there was some way for the app to say, to the user, “Here’s generally what this app wants from you, from an attentional point of view,” that would be huge. It would probably be the primary way I would decide which apps I download and use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you optimistic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of individuals working at these companies, I’m still heartened and optimistic, because everybody who’s a designer or engineer is also a user at the end of the day. Nobody goes into design because they want to make life worse. The challenges, generally, are structural, whether it’s about the existing business models of companies or the way in which certain forms of corporate legal structures don’t give people the space to balance some of these more petty, immediate goals with more noble kinds of things. It’s hard to say, in terms of the longer-term of tech evolution, whether it will be optimistic or not. I’m hoping that there will be a point where, if we don’t restrain things or turn the battleship around, we realize the unsustainability of it, from a business point of view but also in our own lives.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Firefox Private Browsing vs. Chrome Incognito: Which Is Faster?</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/20/firefox-private-browsing-vs-chrome-incognito/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/20/firefox-private-browsing-vs-chrome-incognito/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;disclaimer&quot;&gt;With the launch of Firefox Quantum, Mozilla decided to team up with Disconnect Inc. to compare page load times between desktop versions of Chrome’s Incognito mode and Firefox Quantum’s Private Browsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/CAKKqb&quot;&gt;Firefox Quantum&lt;/a&gt; is the fastest version of Firefox we’ve ever made. It is &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/quantum-performance-test/&quot;&gt;twice as fast&lt;/a&gt; as Firefox 52 and often faster than the latest version of Chrome in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIywpvHewc0&quot;&gt;head to head page load comparisons&lt;/a&gt;. By using key performance benchmarks, we were able to optimize Firefox to eliminate unnecessary delays and give our users a great browsing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most browser performance benchmarks focus on the use of a regular browsing mode. But, what about Private Browsing? Given that Private Browsing use is &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/download/Private_Browsing.pdf&quot;&gt;so common&lt;/a&gt;, we wanted to see how Firefox’s Private Browsing compared with Chrome’s Incognito when it came to page load time (that time between a click and the page being fully loaded on the screen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spoiler Alert…. Firefox Quantum’s Private Browsing is fast…. really fast.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why would Private Browsing performance be any different?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Websites have the ability to load content and run scripts from a variety of sources. Some of these &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/lightbeam/&quot;&gt;scripts include trackers&lt;/a&gt;. Trackers are used for a variety of reasons including everything from website analytics to tracking website engagement for the purposes of targeted advertising. The use of trackers on websites is &lt;a href=&quot;https://webtransparency.cs.princeton.edu/webcensus/&quot;&gt;very common&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately trackers can delay the completion of page loads while the browser waits for tracking scripts to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Firefox became the only browser to include Tracking Protection enabled by default in Private Browsing mode. Tracking Protection, as the name implies, blocks resources from loading if the URL being loaded is on a list of known trackers as defined by &lt;a href=&quot;https://disconnect.me/trackerprotection&quot;&gt;Disconnect’s Tracking Protection list&lt;/a&gt;. This list is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://disconnect.me/trackerprotection#trackers-we-dont-block&quot;&gt;balanced approach to blocking&lt;/a&gt; and does not include sites that obey Do Not Track (as defined in the EFF guidelines).  While the feature is meant to help keep users from being tracked when they have explicitly opted to use Private Browsing, the side effect is a much faster browsing experience on websites which attempt to load content from URLs on the tracking list. A previous Firefox &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/files/2017/09/tracking-protection-test.pdf&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in 2015 showed that there was a reduction in median page load time on top News websites of 44%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Firefox Quantum is the fastest version of Firefox yet, we thought it would be interesting to compare page load times between Firefox Quantum’s Private Browsing (&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2015/11/03/firefox-now-offers-a-more-private-browsing-experience/&quot;&gt;which includes Tracking Protection&lt;/a&gt;), and Chrome’s Incognito mode which does not include a tracking protection feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Methodology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://disconnect.me/&quot;&gt;Disconnect&lt;/a&gt;, the organization behind the domain lists used to power Tracking Protection. Page load times for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alexa.com/topsites/category/Top/News&quot;&gt;top 200 news websites as ranked by Alexa.com&lt;/a&gt; were measured using Firefox Quantum (v57.0b10v57 beta) in both default and Private Browsing modes and the most recent Chrome version (v61.0.3163.100) that was available at the time of testing – also in default and Incognito modes. News sites were tested because these sites tend to &lt;a href=&quot;https://webtransparency.cs.princeton.edu/webcensus/&quot;&gt;have the most trackers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the news websites were loaded 10 times. In order for the test to measure comparable timings and to be reproducible by others, load times were measured using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/PerformanceTiming&quot;&gt;PerformanceTiming API&lt;/a&gt; for both Firefox and Chrome for each page load. In particular, the total load time is considered as the difference between &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceTiming/loadEventEnd&quot;&gt;PerformanceTiming.loadEventEnd&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceTiming/navigationStart&quot;&gt;PerformanceTiming.navigationStart&lt;/a&gt;. The tests were controlled through an automated script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All rounds of testing were conducted on a new Macbook Pro (13’’ Macbook Pro 2017, 3.1GHz i5, 16GB memory, OSX 10.13). We tested on a fast network connection with the Macbook Pro connected to a Webpass 100Mbps connection over WiFi (802.11ac, 867Mbit/s). For a deep dive into the methodology, check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/11/comparing-browser-page-load-time-an-introduction-to-methodology/&quot;&gt;Mozilla Hacks post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the top 200 news websites tested, the average page load time for Firefox Quantum’s Private Browsing is 3.2 seconds compared to Chrome’s Incognito mode which took an average of 7.7 seconds to load a page for the fast Gigabit connection. This means that, on average, Firefox Quantum’s Private Browsing loads page 2.4x faster than Chrome in Incognito mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_11044&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-11044&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Disconnect-Study-Blog-Post-Graph-01-1-300x150.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;806&quot; height=&quot;403&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Disconnect-Study-Blog-Post-Graph-01-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Disconnect-Study-Blog-Post-Graph-01-1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Disconnect-Study-Blog-Post-Graph-01-1-600x300.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Disconnect-Study-Blog-Post-Graph-01-1.jpg 1000w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 806px) 100vw, 806px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;On average, Firefox Quantum’s Private Browsing loads page 2.4x faster than Chrome in Incognito mode&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing the average load times for Chrome also shows that Incognito mode alone does not bring any speed improvements. It is the Tracking Protection that makes the difference as can be seen from the results for Firefox Quantum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to look at this data is by looking at the time that is acceptable to users for pages to be loaded. A third party study by SOASTA Inc. recently found that an average session load time of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.soasta.com/blog/google-machine-learning-ecommerce-research/&quot;&gt;6 seconds already leads to a 70% user bounce rate&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, it makes sense to put our measurements in the context of looking at the share of pages per browser that took longer than 6 seconds to load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_11045&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-11045&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Disconnect-Study-Blog-Post-Graph-02-300x150.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;814&quot; height=&quot;407&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Disconnect-Study-Blog-Post-Graph-02-300x150.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Disconnect-Study-Blog-Post-Graph-02-768x384.jpg 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Disconnect-Study-Blog-Post-Graph-02-600x300.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Disconnect-Study-Blog-Post-Graph-02.jpg 1000w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 814px) 100vw, 814px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;95% of page loads met the 6 second or faster threshold using Firefox Quantum Private Browsing with Tracking Protection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;95% of page loads met the 6 second or faster threshold using Firefox Quantum Private Browsing with Tracking Protection enabled, while only 70% of page loads made the cut on Chrome, leaving nearly a third of the news sites unable to load within that time frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the speed improvements in Firefox Quantum will vary depending on the website, overall users can expect that Private Browsing in Firefox will be faster than Chrome’s Incognito mode right out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, due to these findings, we wanted users to be able to benefit from the increased speed and privacy outside of Private Browsing mode. With Firefox Quantum, users now have the ability to enable Tracking Protection in Firefox at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interested? Then try Private Browsing for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to take it up a notch and enable Tracking Protection &lt;em&gt;every time&lt;/em&gt; you use Firefox, then download &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/CAKKqb&quot;&gt;Firefox Quantum&lt;/a&gt;, open Preferences. Choose Privacy &amp;amp; Security and scroll down until you find the Tracking Protection section. Alternatively, simply search for “Tracking Protection” in the &lt;em&gt;Find in Preferences&lt;/em&gt; field. Enable Tracking Protection “Always” and you are set to enjoy both improved speed and privacy whenever you use Firefox Quantum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When enabling it, please keep in mind that Tracking Protection may block social “like” buttons, commenting tools and some cross-site video content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_11041&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-11041&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-16-Comparing-Page-Load-Time-Firefox-Private-Browsing-vs-Chrome-Incognito-300x117.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;707&quot; height=&quot;276&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-16-Comparing-Page-Load-Time-Firefox-Private-Browsing-vs-Chrome-Incognito-300x117.png 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-16-Comparing-Page-Load-Time-Firefox-Private-Browsing-vs-Chrome-Incognito-600x234.png 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-16-Comparing-Page-Load-Time-Firefox-Private-Browsing-vs-Chrome-Incognito.png 624w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 707px) 100vw, 707px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Tracking Protection in the new Firefox browser&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Tracking Protection is a feature that you’ve commonly used or that you will want to use more regularly, give &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/CAKKqb&quot;&gt;Firefox Quantum&lt;/a&gt; a try to experience how fast it is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disconnect Inc. and Mozilla partnered up in 2015 to power Firefox’s Tracking Protection giving you control over the data that third parties receive from you online. The blocklist is based on a list of known trackers as defined by Disconnect’s Tracking Protection list. As a follow-up, we asked ourselves if Firefox’s Private Browsing mode with Tracking Protection might also offer speed benefits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Stanford Compilers Course</title>
<link>https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/Compilers/Fall2014/about</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/Compilers/Fall2014/about</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;About This Course&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This self-paced course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers, including lexical analysis, parsing, syntax-directed translation, abstract syntax trees, types and type checking, intermediate languages, dataflow analysis, program optimization, code generation, and runtime systems. As a result, you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An optional course project is to write a complete compiler for COOL, the Classroom Object Oriented Language. COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. Students who choose to do the project can implement it in either C++ or Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy the course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Study Compilers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything that computers do is the result of some program, and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed over the last 60 years. Designing and implementing a programming language turns out to be difficult; some of the best minds in computer science have thought about the problems involved and contributed beautiful and deep results. Learning something about compilers will show you the interplay of theory and practice in computer science, especially how powerful general ideas combined with engineering insight can lead to practical solutions to very hard problems. Knowing how a compiler works will also make you a better programmer and increase your ability to learn new programming languages quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;thumb tright&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;thumbinner&quot; style=&quot;width:302px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Orlando-Ferguson-flat-earth-map_edit.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Orlando-Ferguson-flat-earth-map_edit.jpg/300px-Orlando-Ferguson-flat-earth-map_edit.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;206&quot; class=&quot;thumbimage&quot; srcset=&quot;//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Orlando-Ferguson-flat-earth-map_edit.jpg/450px-Orlando-Ferguson-flat-earth-map_edit.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Orlando-Ferguson-flat-earth-map_edit.jpg/600px-Orlando-Ferguson-flat-earth-map_edit.jpg 2x&quot; data-file-width=&quot;3142&quot; data-file-height=&quot;2162&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;thumbcaption&quot;&gt;

The Flat Earth model&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not likely you'll ever run across an editor who argues &lt;b&gt;Why Wikipedia cannot claim the Earth is not flat&lt;/b&gt;. But you may encounter some who'll strenuously maintain that a particular &quot;breakthrough&quot;, &quot;notable&quot; or &quot;controversial&quot; idea, belief, or theory deserves more consideration than it has received in the academic world. Using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Why_Wikipedia_cannot_claim_the_earth_is_not_flat#Historical_note&quot;&gt;Flat Earth example (below)&lt;/a&gt;, this essay will examine ten types of arguments commonly used by advocates of fringe concepts and advise the neutrally-minded editor or administrator on how to defuse them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p/&gt;

&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Policy_and_practices&quot;&gt;Policy and practices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the stated goal of Wikipedia to mirror the current consensus of mainstream scholarship – in the words of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOT&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:NOT&quot;&gt;WP:NOT&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;accepted knowledge&quot;. Self evidently, the mainstream view of what is &lt;i&gt;accepted&lt;/i&gt; knowledge in a discipline has the largest following and as such the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:NPOV&quot;&gt;due weight&lt;/a&gt; in the literature. The encyclopedia does not act as an advocate for or passionately promote pioneering minority theories that are currently controversial (i.e &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SOAPBOX&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:SOAPBOX&quot;&gt;soapboxing&lt;/a&gt;), even if there is a slim chance beliefs on the margin may eventually gain wide consensus (as happened with the proposals of the &lt;b&gt;round Earth&lt;/b&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaic_Period&quot; class=&quot;mw-disambig&quot; title=&quot;Archaic Period&quot;&gt;Archaic Periods&lt;/a&gt; and continental drift before the mechanism of plate tectonics, two classic examples of cutting edge views once deemed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Fringe&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:Fringe&quot;&gt;fringe&lt;/a&gt; theories that turned out to be justified). Wikipedia acknowledges diverse viewpoints on contemporary controversies but represents them in proportion to their prevalence (or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:UNDUE&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:UNDUE&quot;&gt;due weight&lt;/a&gt;) among serious scholars and reporters with reputations of responsibility and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RELIABLE&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:RELIABLE&quot;&gt;reliability&lt;/a&gt;. Wikipedia may in some cases limit its mention of theories understood to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:FRINGE&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:FRINGE&quot;&gt;fringe&lt;/a&gt; to specific articles about those theories, and remove their mention from other articles, per the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:ONEWAY&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:ONEWAY&quot;&gt;one way&lt;/a&gt; principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, Wikipedia is not a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Soapbox&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:Soapbox&quot;&gt;soapbox&lt;/a&gt; for people to advocate pet points of view. Nor is Wikipedia in the business of adjudicating which pet points of view have a potential for subsequent wide acceptance in the future. Some marginal theories are &lt;i&gt;fringe science&lt;/i&gt; and some are &lt;i&gt;pseudo-science&lt;/i&gt; but Wikipedia is not in the business of calling the shots as to where these stand except where reliable sources clarify those differences. Thus Wikipedia is academically conservative, as is fitting for a standard reference work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Wikipedia's_role_as_a_reference_work&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Wikipedia.27s_role_as_a_reference_work&quot;&gt;Wikipedia's role as a reference work&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The threshold for including material in Wikipedia is that it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:Verifiability&quot;&gt;verifiable&lt;/a&gt;, not merely that we think it is true. That is, readers must be able to check that the material has already been published by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RS&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:RS&quot;&gt;reliable source&lt;/a&gt;. Editors should provide a reliable source for quotations and for any material that is challenged or likely to be challenged, or the material may be removed. Verifiability is one of Wikipedia's core content policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Wikipedia is not worried &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt; about whether &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth&quot; title=&quot;Flat Earth&quot;&gt;the theory that the Earth is flat&lt;/a&gt; is true. There must be current, reliable and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:IS&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:IS&quot;&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt; sources substantiating claims that the earth is flat. But there are no such sources &lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Why_Wikipedia_cannot_claim_the_earth_is_not_flat#cite_note-1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that are current (almost no scientists have thought the earth was flat since about the fourth century BC), that are reliable (reliable sources are reviewed for accuracy) or independent (a journal published by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth_Society&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Flat Earth Society&quot;&gt;Flat Earth Society&lt;/a&gt; would not be independent&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-2&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Why_Wikipedia_cannot_claim_the_earth_is_not_flat#cite_note-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Wikipedia had been available around the sixth century B.C., it would have reported the view that the Earth is flat as a fact and &lt;i&gt;without qualification&lt;/i&gt;. And it would have reported the views of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes&quot; title=&quot;Eratosthenes&quot;&gt;Eratosthenes&lt;/a&gt; (who correctly determined the earth's circumference in 240BC) either as controversial, or a fringe view. Similarly if available in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Galileo&quot;&gt;Galileo&lt;/a&gt;'s time, it would have reported the view that the sun goes round the earth as a fact, and if Galileo had been a &lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://la.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicipaedia:Pagina_prima&quot;&gt;Vicipaedia&lt;/a&gt; editor, his view would have been rejected as 'originale investigationis'. Of course, if there is a popularly held or notable view that the earth is flat, Wikipedia &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth_Society&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Flat Earth Society&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; this view. But it does not report it as true. It reports only on what its adherents believe, the history of the view, and its notable or prominent adherents. Wikipedia is inherently a non-innovative reference work: it stifles creativity and free-thought. Which is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1066_and_All_That&quot; title=&quot;1066 and All That&quot;&gt;A Good Thing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Close_encounters_of_the_fringe_kind&quot;&gt;Close encounters of the fringe kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, civic-minded Wikipedia editors must act to mitigate, redesign, and sometimes destroy the offerings of users who think that a particular 'breakthrough' or 'notable' or 'controversial' idea or theory deserves more consideration than it has received in the academic world. Since Wikipedia is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Open source&quot;&gt;open project&lt;/a&gt; that &quot;anyone can edit&quot;, good editors don't take such encounters personally. They do not automatically view supporters of fringe theories as &quot;the enemy&quot;. They know that sometimes these fallacies are propagated &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor&quot; title=&quot;Hanlon's razor&quot;&gt;not out of malice, but ignorance&lt;/a&gt;. Humans are fallible creatures, and there are many more ways to be wrong than right. Science is stodgy, typically not glamorous, and entails hard work. By contrast, speculation is stimulating, easy, and fun. It's more exciting to see yourself as a re-discoverer of ancient truths or in the vanguard of a revolutionary scientific breakthrough. Belonging to a small club with a particular belief can be very fulfilling. The world would be a more exciting place if there were malevolent aliens abducting humans, if dead people could send us messages, if exotic plants were able to miraculously cure all disease, if free energy were readily available to anyone, or if our dreams could foretell the future. In addition, popular culture can often confuse the general public with uncritical or credulous presentations of such concepts on the internet, in books, radio talk shows, TV, and films. It's little wonder that Wikipedia attracts individuals who feel the encyclopedia should include sympathetic coverage of these types of subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Dealing_with_dedicated_fringe_advocates&quot;&gt;Dealing with dedicated fringe advocates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Wikipedia can attract some extremely dedicated individuals whose aim is to promote &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscience&quot; title=&quot;Pseudoscience&quot;&gt;pseudoscience&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crank_(person)&quot; title=&quot;Crank (person)&quot;&gt;crankery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory&quot; title=&quot;Conspiracy theory&quot;&gt;conspiracy theories&lt;/a&gt;, marginal &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism&quot; title=&quot;Nationalism&quot;&gt;nationalist&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudohistory&quot; title=&quot;Pseudohistory&quot;&gt;historic&lt;/a&gt; viewpoints and the like, together with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-scholarship&quot; title=&quot;Pseudo-scholarship&quot;&gt;other theories entirely unrecognised by academia&lt;/a&gt;. These enthusiasts often edit primarily or entirely on one topic or theme. They attempt to water down language and unreasonably exclude, marginalize or push views beyond the requirements of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:Neutral point of view&quot;&gt;Neutral point of view&lt;/a&gt;, especially by giving &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:DUE&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:DUE&quot;&gt;undue weight&lt;/a&gt; to their preferred theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;thumb tright&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;thumbinner&quot; style=&quot;width:302px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Webcomic_xkcd_-_Wikipedian_protester.png&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Webcomic_xkcd_-_Wikipedian_protester.png/300px-Webcomic_xkcd_-_Wikipedian_protester.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;163&quot; class=&quot;thumbimage&quot; srcset=&quot;//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Webcomic_xkcd_-_Wikipedian_protester.png/450px-Webcomic_xkcd_-_Wikipedian_protester.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Webcomic_xkcd_-_Wikipedian_protester.png 2x&quot; data-file-width=&quot;500&quot; data-file-height=&quot;271&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;thumbcaption&quot;&gt;

&quot;I see people here from all four corners of the earth&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such grandstanding is forbidden by a variety of Wikipedia policies and guidelines (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:Verifiability&quot;&gt;Verifiability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:Neutral point of view&quot;&gt;Neutral point of view&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not&quot;&gt;What Wikipedia is not&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Fringe_theories&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:Fringe theories&quot;&gt;Fringe theories&lt;/a&gt; to name just a few). These policies, &lt;i&gt;correctly understood&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;correctly used&lt;/i&gt;, will successfully exclude non-notable or fringe views. But many dedicated fringe advocates are familiar with these policies, and have become expert at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaming_the_system&quot; title=&quot;Gaming the system&quot;&gt;gaming them&lt;/a&gt; or even using them against neutrally-minded but inexpert editors. The latter often find their efforts subverted at every step by advocates who revert war over edits, frivolously request citations for obvious or well known information, argue endlessly about the neutral-point-of-view policy and particularly try to undermine the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:DUE&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:DUE&quot;&gt;undue weight clause&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maneuver_warfare&quot; title=&quot;Maneuver warfare&quot;&gt;maneuvering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster&quot; title=&quot;Filibuster&quot;&gt;filibustering&lt;/a&gt; is soon likely to exhaust the patience of any reasonable person who naturally prefers not to reason with the unreasonable, and who, unlike the advocate, has no special interest or passion other than striving to maintain neutrality. Additionally, by continually engaging fringe advocates in endless argument, you run the risk of turning Wikipedia into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:BATTLEGROUND&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:BATTLEGROUND&quot;&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt; or a debating society. At the present time, Wikipedia does not have an effective means to address superficially polite but tendentious, long-term, fringe advocacy. Some contend that this is a main flaw of Wikipedia; that unlike conventional encyclopedias, fanatics (no matter how amateur or idiotic) can always get their way if they stay around long enough and make enough edits and reversions. &lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-3&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Why_Wikipedia_cannot_claim_the_earth_is_not_flat#cite_note-3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In this sense, Wikipedia's '&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;http://thetyee.ca/Mediacheck/2006/12/22/Citizendium/&quot;&gt;commitment to amateurism&lt;/a&gt;' does not always work for the best interests of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Ten_types_of_arguments&quot;&gt;Ten types of arguments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguments commonly used by fringe advocates to support inclusion of marginal viewpoints against official policies fall into a small number of easily recognizable categories. Here are the top ten approaches that might be used by our allegorical Flat Earth advocate to argue that Wikipedia cannot claim &quot;The Earth is not flat&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;1._Personalisation&quot;&gt;1. Personalisation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;thumb tright&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;thumbinner&quot; style=&quot;width:302px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Last-stand.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Last-stand.jpg/300px-Last-stand.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; class=&quot;thumbimage&quot; srcset=&quot;//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Last-stand.jpg/450px-Last-stand.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Last-stand.jpg/600px-Last-stand.jpg 2x&quot; data-file-width=&quot;1600&quot; data-file-height=&quot;960&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;thumbcaption&quot;&gt;

&quot;I only came here to fix punctuation on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming&quot; title=&quot;Global warming&quot;&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt; article!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Examples&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your bias against the earth being flat is too strong to be objective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your arguments against the flat earth theory so resemble the arguments of editor X that you must be their sockpuppet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The flat earth article is being degraded by those who don't like the flat earth theory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ignoring users with differing opinions does nothing to help the further development of this page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to recognise&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personalisation is easily the most common form of attack on neutrally-minded editors. Personalisation is ignoring the basis for inclusion altogether, and making the argument personal. For example, they argue that an editor is biased towards the mainstream, or that editors are ganging up because their arguments are so similar (even though they would be similar – the main argument against the earth being flat is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography&quot; title=&quot;Topography&quot;&gt;topographical&lt;/a&gt;, and it is hard to argue against it without repeating the argument). Or they may claim that to disagree with an editor with a fringe agenda is claimed to be uncivil, a personal attack (violation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_personal_attacks&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:No personal attacks&quot;&gt;No personal attacks&lt;/a&gt;), a violation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Do_not_bite_the_newcomers&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:Do not bite the newcomers&quot;&gt;Do not bite the newcomers&lt;/a&gt; or a violation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:Assume good faith&quot;&gt;Assume good faith&lt;/a&gt;. It may even be claimed that sources that disagree with the fringe point of view cannot be used if they reflect poorly on any living people who are proponents of the fringe point of view (such as critical book reviews, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to reply&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignore any personal attack altogether – and particularly &lt;i&gt;do not&lt;/i&gt; make a personal attack yourself, however tempting it may be. Also try to ignore the arguments and reasons used by mainstream science itself. Your opponents will love this and turn the talk page into a battlefield of competing claims and counterclaims. Simply stick to the principles: if mainstream science holds that the earth is round, and there are reliable sources establishing this as a fact, that is sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

Sources must be reliable, independent and &lt;i&gt;current&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Examples&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex&quot; title=&quot;Essex&quot;&gt;Essex&lt;/a&gt; local authorities trained employees in flat earth theory in 1993.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The statement that the earth is flat is reliably sourced from &lt;i&gt;Flat Earth&lt;/i&gt; magazine, which is peer-reviewed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are published sources (including &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed&quot; title=&quot;PubMed&quot;&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;) that back up the view that people use Flat Earth theory as an adjunct to their existing qualifications and businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you explain the EXCELLANT [&lt;i&gt;sic&lt;/i&gt;] results which the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Army&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;US Army&quot;&gt;US Army&lt;/a&gt; gets by using techniques which are talked about in Flat Earth literature? If it's a bunch of hogwash, then the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRADOC&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;TRADOC&quot;&gt;TRADOC&lt;/a&gt;'s results should be in shambles. Instead, we have the most successful, motivated force on the planet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since established scientists attended a flat-earth conference, it follows they take the theory seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to recognise&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you have insisted on the use of reliable sources, supporters of the marginal view will then try to exploit the definition of 'reliable source'. They will argue for the inclusion of material of dubious reliability; for example, using commentary from partisan think-tanks rather than from the scientific literature. Occasionally, they will discover that they can get more attention if they make appeals to authority by presenting supporters who have academic credentials. Typical pseudoscience sources include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dedicated websites (normally registered under a .com or .org – rarely under .edu though there are occasions where this may be possible)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dedicated periodicals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-published sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publications made outside the typical scientific presses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In-house journals (not to be confused with academic journals)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Occasional peer-reviewed articles – often in more obscure journals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to reply&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attention to such detail is only warranted if there is third-party mention of this. Pseudoscientific groups making a to-do over a person's academic degrees or honorification should be treated as promotionalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;thumbcaption&quot;&gt;

Claims must be balanced&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Examples&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You must not say 'the earth is not flat' but 'according to critics of the flat-earth theory, the earth is not flat'.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There should be no criticism of the flat earth theory in the introduction to the article. There is already criticism of the theory in the article, section 94.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So what if the article on flat earth theory is 250k, and the round earth article only 8k? The answer is not to fix the balance by writing less about the flat earth, that only makes Wikipedia worse, but to add more information about the earth being round.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this an encyclopedia for academics or for the general public?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Criticism of the flat earth theory should be balanced by criticism of the round earth theory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The article lead should begin with a pure definition. Criticism should come second, e.g.:&lt;i&gt;&quot;&lt;b&gt;Flat Earth&lt;/b&gt; refers to the Earth's flat shape. Skeptics say the Earth is round.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to recognise&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when supporters of fringe viewpoints recognise the mainstream view as mainstream and established, and agree that Wikipedia may state the mainstream view without qualification, they will still challenge the relative prominence accorded to the mainstream over the fringe viewpoint, and make all sorts of arguments about balance. It is often seriously claimed that the &quot;N&quot; in NPOV (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:Neutral point of view&quot;&gt;Neutral point of view&lt;/a&gt;) means that no negative or critical or mainstream material can appear at all in the article, since it is not neutral, or that Wikipedia is not for advocacy, and so advocates of 'scientific points of view' should not overstate their case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is claimed that the reader will not understand the idea unless it is described without criticism, since Wikipedia is an encyclopedia for the general public, not a technical journal. Reversing this argument, they will state that readers are smart enough to know that fringe ideas are nonsense without including any negative or critical material or sources. They will propose that negative material be forked off into another article, or relegated into a &quot;criticism ghetto&quot; or criticism section or removed from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lead_section&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:Lead section&quot;&gt;Lead section&lt;/a&gt;. They may argue that one must always state the idea first before criticizing it, or that any sources that disagree with the fringe point of view cannot be used since they violate the Neutral point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They may claim that any critical or negative material cannot appear in an article since it is biased. Or that any negative or critical material is unusable since it is just opinion and not fact. Some of them will even claim that there are no facts, arguing that if a fringe minority, not present in any reliable sources, disagrees with a widely accepted fact, it violates Neutral point of view to state it as a fact in the article. They may demand that every statement of fact should be attributed, no matter how universally accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to reply&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the root of these arguments are intentional (or unintentional) misinterpretations of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:Neutral point of view&quot;&gt;Neutral point of view&lt;/a&gt;, particularly undue weight, although certain kinds of deliberate &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pettifogger&quot; class=&quot;extiw&quot; title=&quot;wiktionary:pettifogger&quot;&gt;pettifogging&lt;/a&gt; can also be a sign of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Gaming_the_system&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:Gaming the system&quot;&gt;gaming the system&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Examples&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The flat earth theory has been marginalised by the scientific establishment in order to protect its interests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any scientist who tried to study flat-earth theory would lose his research funding. Dissent is being suppressed by the scientific establishment&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-4&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Why_Wikipedia_cannot_claim_the_earth_is_not_flat#cite_note-4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rosencrantz was tremendously rude about scientists who claimed the earth was round. If the scientific establishment has marginalized him this is not really surprising.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a professional astronomer you have a clear conflict of interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X, Y and Z are hard-line skeptics about flat-earthism. They often publish in skeptics magazines and take a hard line with any approach to any theory which is not empirically verified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to recognise&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next tactic is to appeal to your ideas about free speech and distrust of censorship and the establishment. All theories that are not generally accepted have a part of the theory devoted to explaining why this is. Fringe theories are no exception. They will claim that the &lt;i&gt;scientific establishment&lt;/i&gt; is afraid of being proved wrong, and hence is trying to suppress the truth. This is classic &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory&quot; title=&quot;Conspiracy theory&quot;&gt;conspiracy theory&lt;/a&gt;. Their theory is not accepted because the black suits in the Scientific Establishment are not concerned about the pursuit of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth&quot; title=&quot;Truth&quot;&gt;truth&lt;/a&gt;, but are much more concerned about not rocking the boat in order to protect their vested interests. The round-earth theorists have the backing of the major media who also have vested interests which they must protect. This explains why the discoveries of 'edges' round the earth into which planes have gone missing, reports of travelers who have looked into the abyss, are receiving no coverage whatsoever by the major newspapers or the major TV networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, it is claimed that trying to balance positive content with negative content for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:DUE&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:DUE&quot;&gt;due weight&lt;/a&gt; is censorship. It is claimed that there is a conspiracy against the fringe position and anyone who opposes an uncritical article about the fringe position is in on the conspiracy, has been bought off, is breaking the rules of Wikipedia, is just plain evil, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is claimed that any source that has not written articles that are supportive and uncritical of fringe positions are not suitable as tertiary sources. For example, recently at a controversial article, it was once argued 'Actually, those really shouldn't be used as sources on this topic because (to my knowledge) they haven't written anything pro-X, and hence really can't be considered third party.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&quot;The following list has been compiled from the wealth of research I have put together over the last ten years. I would suggest that all of these are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptilians&quot; title=&quot;Reptilians&quot;&gt;reptilian bloodline&lt;/a&gt;, but I only mention &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapeshifting&quot; title=&quot;Shapeshifting&quot;&gt;shapeshifting&lt;/a&gt; where it has been witnessed&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;cite style=&quot;display: block; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;—&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Icke&quot; title=&quot;David Icke&quot;&gt;David Icke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20010303102743/http://www.davidicke.com/icke/articles/listsatan.html&quot;&gt;List of Famous Satanists, Paedophiles And Mind Controllers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; (2001), formerly at &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;http://davidicke.com&quot;&gt;davidicke.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest reply to these arguments is to humour them. You can agree to their ludicrous claims, but point out that Wikipedia is not here to right wrongs, or address grievances. Point out (see above) that if Wikipedia had been around at the time of Galileo, it would have had a duty to report the claims of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_church&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Catholic church&quot;&gt;Catholic church&lt;/a&gt; as fact, without qualification, despite the conspiracy that undoubtedly existed.&lt;/p&gt;

What a scorcher! The ball is in &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; court&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Examples&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;X's paper on 'scientific fallacies' contains only passing reference to the 'flat earth fallacy'. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:NPOV&quot;&gt;WP:NPOV&lt;/a&gt; says &quot;Even with well-sourced material ... if you use it out of context or to advance a position that is not directly and explicitly supported by the source used, you as an editor are engaging in original research.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;You are taking lack of discussion of whether the earth is flat as evidence an author picks a side on the issue.... The evidence we should consider are those who consider the earth is flat, and those who explicitly reject this view. Sources that remain silent on the issue should be discarded.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no reliable source for the statement that 'flat-earthism has entirely been ignored by reliable sources'.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The statement 'there is no scientific consensus for the flat-earth view' has no scientific consensus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There has been no serious study of whether the earth is flat since 1493.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-5&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Why_Wikipedia_cannot_claim_the_earth_is_not_flat#cite_note-5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Therefore we cannot claim in Wikipedia that earth is not flat, only that a study in 1493 came to this conclusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X's statement &quot;Informal soundings amongst scientists revealed an almost total absence of awareness of the flat earth theory&quot; is mere opinion. X is using personal experience as evidence. This is not a scientific evidence and is therefore mere opinion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can't say &quot;modern geologists reject Rosencranz's theories.&quot; Very few scholars have even read Rosencranz or care, so don't extrapolate that to the whole field as if they have rigorously investigated his work as a group. (recently from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_astronauts&quot; title=&quot;Ancient astronauts&quot;&gt;Ancient astronauts&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Prove that there are no ______.&quot; You can't prove that there are none, only that we haven't found one yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to recognise&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We move to the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermonuclear_weapon&quot; title=&quot;Thermonuclear weapon&quot;&gt;powerful weapon&lt;/a&gt; in the fringe armoury: the argument from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_onus&quot; title=&quot;Reverse onus&quot;&gt;reversed burden of proof&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of them having to prove that their view is supported by reliable and independent sources, they will shift the burden of proof over to you, so you have to prove either that their view is &lt;i&gt;not supported&lt;/i&gt;, or even that it is &lt;i&gt;refuted&lt;/i&gt; by reliable and independent sources. This is difficult for two reasons. First, it is always difficult to prove a negative existential statement (which is in effect a claim about everything there is). Second, because science generally ignores pseudoscience, it is often very difficult to find reliable sources that describe some pseudoscientific view as pseudoscientific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to reply&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This argument is often difficult to address. However, you should always recognise the shifting of the burden for what it is, the second that ball comes thundering down the court at 80 mph. Slam it back. &lt;i&gt;Insist that the burden is theirs&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&quot;When two or more theories are in competition, it is common for one of them to be treated as the established position – the default option, as it were – and the others to be treated as challengers. A challenging theory is normally expected to bear the burden or onus of proof. In other words, advocates of the challenging theory are expected to provide highly convincing evidence and arguments before the theory can be taken seriously. To use a different metaphor, it is assumed that the established theory has jumped over a very high hurdle to gain its leading position and that any challenger must jump over an equally high hurdle before being in contention for the remainder of the race.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-6&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Why_Wikipedia_cannot_claim_the_earth_is_not_flat#cite_note-6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, in such cases it is legitimate to source from non-promotional descriptions of pseudoscience that can only be obtained from second- and third-party sources. Although most of these sources will not be peer-reviewed simply because science tends to ignore pseudoscience, they are still &lt;i&gt;independent&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, the following are reliable sources for describing pseudoscience:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The statement 'The earth is round' has reliable sources in scientific literature. The statement 'If the X is round, X is not flat' is a valid inference that can be sourced from any reliable logic textbook. But 'The earth is not flat', while a conclusion validly yielded by these two reliably-sourced premises, is a violation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SYNTH&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:SYNTH&quot;&gt;WP:SYNTH&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Even if published by reliable sources, material must not be connected together in such a way that it constitutes original research&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One should use only primary sources. Relying on secondary sources is POV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Words like &quot;alleged&quot;, &quot;supposed&quot;, and &quot;purported&quot; when used to describe the characteristics of the Flat Earth are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WTA&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:WTA&quot;&gt;WP:WTA&lt;/a&gt; and unduly prejudice the reader against the subject. Words that can be interpreted ambiguously by the reader (such as &quot;apparent&quot;) are better suited to a neutral presentation.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have kept the marginal and fringe viewpoint at bay for some months or years. But now they have got wise, and expert in the ways of Wikipedia. They have read the policies carefully, and have worked out the various loopholes in it, and the endless games they can play with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They now claim that only the proponents of the FRINGE position understand NPOV or NOR or RS, not the experienced editors with tens of thousands of edits, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:FA&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:FA&quot;&gt;FAs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:GA&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:GA&quot;&gt;GAs&lt;/a&gt; to their credit. They will 'wikilawyer' to try to redefine a FRINGE position as nonFRINGE, or the mainstream position as the FRINGE position instead. They will attempt to use mainly primary sources, and to reject secondary and tertiary sources, or to redefine the preferences for secondary and tertiary sources in policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worst of all, it is now many months since you tidied up the article. You have no inherent interest in the Flat Earth theory, and you have moved on to another area of pseudoscience (let's say the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_geocentrism&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Modern geocentrism&quot;&gt;Geocentric theory&lt;/a&gt;). But the Flat Earth supporters are interested in nothing else than their pet theory. They will come back when you are gone and revert when you do not notice. The arguments that you successfully rebutted and dismissed, sometimes with extensive references, will be repeated over and over and over, sometimes just with a cut and paste approach. Sometimes they will be presented by the same person dozens and dozens of times over days and weeks and months. They will try to add information that is (at best) peripherally relevant on the grounds that 'it is verifiable, so it should be in'. They repeatedly use the talk page for soapboxing, or to re-raise the same issues that have already been discussed numerous times. They hang around forever wearing down more serious editors and become expert in an odd kind of way on their niche POV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will make a series of silly and time-wasting requests for comment, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:Mediation&quot;&gt;mediation&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:Arbitration&quot;&gt;arbitration&lt;/a&gt; again to try to wear you down. They will add  tags repeatedly to well-known material, or material that is fully referenced on wikilinked articles that discuss that point in more detail. Assorted templates branding the article are thrown on the article repeatedly, such as the claim that an NPOV dispute is going on, when it is more accurate to describe the discussion as revolving around some editor's idiosyncratic interpretation of NPOV to satisfy their own personal agenda. Accusations that a group editing the article &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:OWN&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:OWN&quot;&gt;own&lt;/a&gt; the article since they will not change the consensus to satisfy one malcontent are common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to reply&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are unable to discourage a fringe advocate from willfully and knowingly misusing policy you might seek support from the community via &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:Mediation&quot;&gt;mediation&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:Arbitration&quot;&gt;arbitration&lt;/a&gt;. However, many fringe advocates thrive on the increased attention and actually welcome these forums as a soapbox from which to further argue their viewpoint. Finding themselves in the spotlight, it is not unusual for dedicated fringe advocates to suddenly disavow any former or present interest/connection with the subject of their advocacy (&quot;Gosh, I don't believe the Earth is flat, I'm just here to uphold NPOV&quot;) and profess that they are only fighting &quot;for the good of Wikipedia&quot;. The risks of continued involvement with disputes that escalate to this level should be carefully considered, especially if accompanied by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive_Compulsive_Disorder&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Obsessive Compulsive Disorder&quot;&gt;obsessive/compulsive&lt;/a&gt; behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Examples&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The flat-earth theory is not amenable to scientific approaches and methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flat-earth theorists are pragmatic. They are not interested in what is 'true', they are interested in 'what works'.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rosencrantz never claimed nor explicitly stated that the Flat Earth Theory is a 'science'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to recognise&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way of evading NPOV is to avoid the requirement for reliable sourcing altogether. They will claim that the view in question is simply not amenable to scientific treatment. Source X was from a scientific journal, it attempted to address the Flat Earth theory in a way that science could deal with it. But Flat Earth theory is not amenable to scientific treatment. Source X misunderstood what the theory was really saying. The Flat Earth theory is not something that is really a 'fact' in the scientific sense. (See the archived talk pages of the article &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurolinguistic_programming&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Neurolinguistic programming&quot;&gt;Neurolinguistic programming&lt;/a&gt; for endless repetitions and varieties of this argument).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or they claim that writing material using facts in the same context as in reliable sources violates NPOV since they are following a &quot;narrative&quot;, and we must instead choose facts which no source describes as relevant to allow our readers to decide which &quot;narrative&quot; should be chosen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to reply&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stick to your guns. This is merely a philosophically naive means of evading justification and substantiation. All theories make claims of some sort, otherwise they would not have 'proponents' (a proponent literally 'puts forward' a certain view that is susceptible of truth or falsity). The Flat Earth theory claims that the earth is flat, not round. That is a statement with a binary truth-value. And it is capable of confirmation or refutation, it is verifiable. For example, topography (measuring the distances between defined points on the Earth's surface) shows the shape of the earth. Therefore, the theory is amenable to scientific treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Examples&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scientist X, who claimed the flat-earth theory was nonsense, clearly had not read the literature on the flat-earth theory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scientist X was not trained in flat-earth theory, and therefore could not make an expert judgment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The criticisms made by scientist X were valid only against Rosencrantz' version of the flat-earth theory, long since outmoded. They fail to address Guildenstern's improved version of the theory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your arguments assume there is a mainstream flat earth view. There is no mainstream 'flat earth' view, therefore your criticisms are misplaced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You haven't read any of Rosencrantz' work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to recognise&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special pleading is when the advocates of a fringe viewpoint argue that you have no expertise in the theory (which may, they argue, take years to fully master). You do not understand the theory, and therefore you cannot make your claims. Another version of this argument is to claim there are many different types of the theory, and that while version X and version Y are clearly nonsense, the most recent version Z (which of course you have never heard of) is scientifically impeccable. They may even claim there is no such 'version' of the theory, and that you are attacking a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man&quot; title=&quot;Straw man&quot;&gt;straw man&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to reply&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only people qualified enough to understand flat earth theory are those who just happen to support flat-earth theory? Ridiculous. Advocates, promoters, and self proclaimed &quot;flat-earth theory experts&quot; are not &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:FRIND&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:FRIND&quot;&gt;independent, objective sources&lt;/a&gt; of fact about whether or not the earth is flat, or whether or not flat-earth theory is valid. Also bear in mind that any &quot;new and improved&quot; versions of flat-earth theory must be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTE&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:NOTE&quot;&gt;notable&lt;/a&gt; enough to have attracted review and comment by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:FRIND&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:FRIND&quot;&gt;independent, objective sources&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

A controversy clearly exists&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Examples&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The flat earth theory is clearly controversial. This is proof that scientists take it seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more controversial or fringe a subject, the less the article should tell the reader what to believe. The reader should be allowed to make up his/her own mind concerning the subject. e.g.: &lt;i&gt;&quot;Flat Earthism is a highly controversial subject, and its scientific validity is often questioned.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to recognise&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although supporters of the marginal view cannot overcome Wikipedia policies, they will try to distort and alter an article's language in a way that represents their view as less marginal. The most well-known and often-used tactic is to claim that their viewpoint is 'controversial', as though there were a minority but substantial view held by serious scientists or academics, actively engaged by the mainstream, and which is reported as controversial by reliable sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will try to exploit equivocation in the description of pseudoscience. For example, instead of simply stating: &quot;the Flat Earth theory violates the known laws of geometry&quot;, a proponent may argue for the equivocal statement: &quot;&lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; geometers claim that the Flat Earth theory violates the known laws of geometry&quot;, perhaps adding &quot;but there is considerable &lt;i&gt;controversy&lt;/i&gt; over the matter.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pseudoscience should not be described on its own terms. The goal of writing an article on pseudoscience should be to present the ideas that are most commonly seen in relation to that pseudoscientific idea. This means that when writing an article on pseudoscience, popularity of ideas is a major rationale for inclusion or exclusion. Obscure iterations of pseudoscience should be eliminated, even if so-called &quot;experts&quot; in the subject believe such ideas to be of the utmost importance. The best way to write an article on pseudoscience is to approach it from the perspective of what topics are most prevalent in the popular culture about the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All claims that are made about observable reality which are directly contradicted by mainstream science must be represented as such. Per the rules of reliable sourcing and not unduly weighting fringe opinions, an article about a mainstream topic should marginalize all related pseudoscience topics relative to the prominence seen in secondary and tertiary sources about the mainstream topic. A pseudoscientific topic should not be mentioned in an article about a mainstream topic unless there are independent mainstream sources that connect the topics. For example, there are plenty of mainstream sources which describe how astronomy is not astrology, and so a decent article on the former may mention the latter. However, there are no mainstream sources about special relativity which also mention autodynamics, and so a decent article on the former should not mention the latter. This approach is outlined in the guideline &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:ONEWAY&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia:ONEWAY&quot;&gt;WP:ONEWAY&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is deemed necessary to exclude pseudoscience from a certain article, there should not even be a link through a see also section. Often pseudoscience articles must link to science articles. Rarely will science articles link to pseudoscience articles. That is the principle of one-way linking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last weapon in the pseudoscience arsenal is something you cannot deny: parts of the theory may be true. Proponents will ignore the many bogus and patently untrue claims of the theory, and perhaps not even mention them in the article, but will go on at length about the parts of the theory that are true. Often these are platitudinous, or are statements that are better and more clearly covered in reliable sources. Worse, they will cite reliable sources which make these true claims, but which do not mention the fringe theory, &lt;i&gt;as though they supported the theory&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to reply&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosencrantz may have said that the sky is blue and grass is green but he most likely isn't considered an authority or reliable source for such information. Attention to such details is only warranted if there is significant third-party coverage of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the 1950s historians had established that in the High Middle Ages the educated classes had recovered the ancient Greeks' discovery that the world is a sphere, even though their world-view was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Geocentric&quot;&gt;geocentric&lt;/a&gt;, and that the notion that Columbus's voyage was to prove the world round is a piece of fiction introduced by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Irving&quot; title=&quot;Washington Irving&quot;&gt;Washington Irving&lt;/a&gt;. (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_of_the_Flat_Earth&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Myth of the Flat Earth&quot;&gt;Myth of the Flat Earth&lt;/a&gt;.) Although it was presumed before Copernicus that the earth was the centre of the universe, with the sun revolving around it, we now know that the educated classes still understood the earth to be a sphere with gravity acting towards its centre, contrary to the widespread 19th-century assumption that most mediaeval people believed it to be flat. (For example, the final two cantos of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Alighieri&quot; title=&quot;Dante Alighieri&quot;&gt;Dante Alighieri&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(Dante)&quot; title=&quot;Inferno (Dante)&quot;&gt;Inferno&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; assume a spherical earth.) However, this essay uses the flat earth as a metaphor for explaining Wikipedia policy, not to describe any authentic historical controversy.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Shortest Papers Ever Published (2016)</title>
<link>https://paperpile.com/blog/shortest-papers/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://paperpile.com/blog/shortest-papers/</guid>
<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone no-lazy size-large wp-image-702&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/figure-only-paper-1200x554.png&quot; alt=&quot;figure-only-paper&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;554&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/figure-only-paper.png 1200w, https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/figure-only-paper-600x277.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post is about short papers. It seems out of place writing a long introduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever wondered about the shortest papers ever published, or you just want to take the unique opportunity to read several papers in full within one minute, this post is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Math can be short&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Math can be hard and tedious resulting in very long papers. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiles%27s_proof_of_Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem&quot;&gt;1995 proof of Fermat’s last Theorem&lt;/a&gt; was 108 pages long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But math can also be short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lander and Parkin’s paper about a conjecture by Euler (related to Fermat’s last Theorem), is probably the dream of everyone ever written a paper: &lt;span&gt;It answers an interesting and important question, it’s correct beyond any doubt,  it’s easy to understand and only two sentences long. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Lander-1966.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-border aligncenter wp-image-657 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Lander-1966.png&quot; alt=&quot;A short mathematical proof by a counterexample&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;675&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Lander-1966.png 1200w, https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Lander-1966-600x338.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;img-caption-light&quot;&gt;Lander, L. J., &amp;amp; Parkin, T. R. (1966) Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, 72(6), 1079. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Lander-1966.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to beat that? John Conway and Alexander Soifer submitted a paper in 2005 with the goal to  write the shortest math paper ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is only two words long and contains two distinct proofs of their problem in two figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The editors were a bit surprised: &lt;em&gt;“The Monthly publishes exposition of mathematics at many levels, and it contains articles both long and short. Your article, however, is a bit too short to be a good Monthly article. . . A line or two of explanation would really help.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors did not give up and could convince the editors:  &lt;em&gt;“I respectfully disagree […] What else is there to explain?”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wfnmc.org/mc20101.pdf&quot;&gt;Read the full story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Conway-2004.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-border aligncenter wp-image-659 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Conway-2004.png&quot; alt=&quot;A short figure only proof&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;825&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;img-caption-light&quot;&gt;Conway, J., Soifer, A. (2005). The American Mathematical Monthly: The Official Journal of the Mathematical Association of America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Empty pages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you  write a meaningful paper shorter than 2 words? Probably not. Still, I want to mention the following case report of severe writer’s block, which contribute important zero words to the literature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Upper-1974.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-border aligncenter wp-image-655 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Upper-1974.png&quot; alt=&quot;The shortest paper ever?&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;1717&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Upper-1974.png 1200w, https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Upper-1974-600x859.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;img-caption-light&quot;&gt;Upper, D. (1974) Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 7(3), 497–497. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Upper-1974.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also the following zero-word paper (excluding the abstract) makes an important point. Originally submitted to Nature Chemistry it did not make the cut for publication. But the editors liked it so much that they covered it in their &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.nature.com/thescepticalchymist/2014/06/a-chemical-free-paper.html&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; and their production team produced a print PDF for it. It finally appeared in 2016  in the journal &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ciuz.201600750/abstract&quot;&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Chemie in unserer Zeit&lt;/em&gt;” (50(2), 144–145)&lt;/a&gt;  published by Wiley. It’s a German journal but don’t worry. The empty pages should be easy to read even in German…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Goldberg-2014.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-border aligncenter wp-image-652 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Goldberg-2014.png&quot; alt=&quot;Short paper without any content.&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;1687&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Goldberg-2014.png 1200w, https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Goldberg-2014-600x844.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;img-caption-light&quot;&gt;Sort of published in Nature chemistry, Volume 6 2014 &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Goldberg-2014.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Short abstracts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstracts should be short by definition. But some are shorter than others. These are the shortest we could find:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.paperpile.com/blog/files/Berry-2011.png&quot;&gt;

<description>&lt;h4 class=&quot;story-subheading story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;16&quot; data-total-count=&quot;29358&quot;&gt;Soaring Salaries&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;137&quot; data-total-count=&quot;29495&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-38&quot;&gt;Even in the face of the financial crisis and budget shortfalls, the M.T.A. has given concession after concession to its main labor union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;180&quot; data-total-count=&quot;29675&quot;&gt;Members of the Transport Workers Union got a total of 19 percent in pay raises between 2009 and 2016, compared with 12 percent for the city’s teachers union over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;192&quot; data-total-count=&quot;29867&quot;&gt;The labor contracts also gave members lifetime spousal health benefits and free rides on the Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road. (They already were allowed to ride the subway for free.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;169&quot; data-total-count=&quot;30036&quot;&gt;According to a former union president, John Samuelsen, the organization has secured better deals over the past eight years than any other public labor group in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;188&quot; data-total-count=&quot;30224&quot;&gt;“I look back with satisfaction on what, together, we have accomplished,” Mr. Samuelsen said in a September letter announcing that he was becoming the union’s international president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;297&quot; data-total-count=&quot;30521&quot;&gt;Each of three deals signed from 2009 to 2017 cost more than the M.T.A. anticipated, forcing it to take money from other parts of the budget. The 2014 deal, which cost $525 million, was funded by tapping into a pay-as-you-go account that was intended to pay for capital work, former officials said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;362&quot; data-total-count=&quot;30883&quot;&gt;Subway workers now make an average of $170,000 annually in salary, overtime and benefits, according to a Times analysis of data compiled by the federal Department of Transportation. That is far more than in any other American transit system; the average in cities like Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington is about $100,000 in total compensation annually.&lt;/p&gt;

The nearly 2,500 people who work in New York subway administration make, on average, $280,000 in salary, overtime and benefits. The average elsewhere is $115,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;284&quot; data-total-count=&quot;31378&quot;&gt;New York is more expensive than most other cities, but not by that much. The latest estimate from the federal Department of Commerce said the region’s cost of living was 22 percent higher than the national average and 10 percent higher than the average for other areas with subways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;330&quot; data-total-count=&quot;31708&quot;&gt;Mr. Samuelsen rejected the idea that subway workers were overpaid, arguing that it is a dangerous job in which assault is common. “We earn every penny that we make,” he said. “This is New York City. This isn’t Mayberry. It costs $700,000 to buy a house in Brooklyn. What do you want us to make? Fifteen dollars an hour?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;344&quot; data-total-count=&quot;32052&quot;&gt;Union rules also drive up costs, including by requiring two M.T.A. employees on every train — one to drive, and one to oversee boarding. Virtually every other subway in the world staffs trains with only one worker; if New York did that, it would save nearly $200 million a year, according to an internal M.T.A. analysis obtained by The Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;142&quot; data-total-count=&quot;32194&quot;&gt;Several M.T.A. officials involved in negotiating recent contracts said that there was one reason they accepted the union’s terms: Mr. Cuomo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;185&quot; data-total-count=&quot;32379&quot;&gt;The governor, who is closely aligned with the union and has received $165,000 in campaign contributions from the labor group, once dispatched a top aide to deliver a message, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;132&quot; data-total-count=&quot;32511&quot;&gt;Pay the union and worry about finding the money later, the aide said, according to two former M.T.A. officials who were in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;162&quot; data-total-count=&quot;32673&quot;&gt;Mr. Cuomo’s office said in a statement that the M.T.A. handled its own labor negotiations and that campaign contributions had not influenced any of his actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;story-subheading story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;20&quot; data-total-count=&quot;32693&quot;&gt;A Vast Personal Toll&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;296&quot; data-total-count=&quot;32989&quot;&gt;The cost of increasing delays can be measured not only in numbers, but also in painful absences on special occasions, lost wages and blown opportunities. Over the summer, The Times asked readers to share their experiences with the subway. More than 1,000 responded, mostly with stories of sorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;167&quot; data-total-count=&quot;33156&quot;&gt;Ashley Patterson, 24, from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, began having anxiety attacks on the subway this summer and now follows a careful routine to keep calm during delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;205&quot; data-total-count=&quot;33361&quot;&gt;“I think that that’s something that the M.T.A. should be thinking about,” Ms. Patterson said. “It’s not just about the inconvenience of being late to work. There’s this mental health aspect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;292&quot; data-total-count=&quot;33653&quot;&gt;Laura Hernandez, 34, a city employee from Woodside, Queens, missed an appointment to inspect the housing conditions of the clients of a social service agency. “I am a new employee on probation, and it does not look good to arrive over an hour late for an appointment,” Ms. Hernandez said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;236&quot; data-total-count=&quot;33889&quot;&gt;Juliana S. Karol, 30, from the Upper East Side of Manhattan, is a rabbinical student at Hebrew Union College downtown. She was late to a meeting to discuss her senior thesis, ordination and job placement. She was also 38 weeks pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;258&quot; data-total-count=&quot;34147&quot;&gt;“I actually ended up writing my High Holy Days sermon about the subway,” Ms. Karol said. “About the opportunities that the subway crisis gives us to reframe both the gratitude we have when things are going right and how we respond when they are not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;160&quot; data-total-count=&quot;34307&quot;&gt;The entire fifth-grade class at Public School 32 in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, had to cancel a field trip to see a movie — a reward for completing math exams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;385&quot; data-total-count=&quot;34692&quot;&gt;“They had actually gone to the station, and they just ended up waiting forever,” said Dawn Reed, 52, whose son was one of the disappointed students. She said she used the experience to teach him about managing expectations. “It’s getting progressively worse,” she said of the subway. “And delays are a part of life, and it’s difficult to have any sense of consistency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;245&quot; data-total-count=&quot;34937&quot;&gt;Ariel Leigh Cohen, 26, from Sunnyside, Queens, missed an interview for a job painting scenery for a major Broadway show. It would have paid twice her salary as a salon receptionist and brought her closer to her dream of working in show business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;210&quot; data-total-count=&quot;35147&quot;&gt;“I was trying to change my life and do what I came to New York to do,” Ms. Cohen said. “It would’ve opened up another world of possibilities. Opportunities like that don’t come around often at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;258&quot; data-total-count=&quot;35405&quot;&gt;And then there are stories like Rosalie Osian’s. A chaplain who comforts the terminally ill for Caring Hospice Services, Ms. Osian, 58, got word one Friday that a patient was dying in Brooklyn, and she struck out on a 2 train from 72nd Street in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;369&quot; data-total-count=&quot;35774&quot;&gt;She made it as far as Fulton Street downtown before an announcement told her to switch to the 4 or 5. Problems on that line forced her to switch trains again, and at one point she was left standing on a platform, racked by the need to be with the patient and prepare the family for grief and pending loss. She was late getting there but made it before the patient died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;215&quot; data-total-count=&quot;35989&quot;&gt;“I’m not the only one,” Ms. Osian said. “There are people traveling the city all day helping people. There are home health aides and others. And if the subways are delayed, they can’t get to their work.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>We Can’t Trust Facebook to Regulate Itself</title>

&lt;div id=&quot;top-slug&quot; class=&quot;ResponsiveAd-hide--3eu5-&quot; data-reactid=&quot;42&quot;&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;43&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneOpinion--19bv1&quot; data-reactid=&quot;104&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;105&quot;&gt;I led Facebook’s efforts to fix privacy problems on its developer platform in advance of its 2012 initial public offering. What I saw from the inside was a company that prioritized data collection from its users over protecting them from abuse. As the world contemplates what to do about Facebook in the wake of its role in Russia’s election meddling, it must consider this history. Lawmakers shouldn’t allow Facebook to regulate itself. Because it won’t.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneOpinion--19bv1&quot; data-reactid=&quot;108&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;109&quot;&gt;Facebook knows what you look like, your location, who your friends are, your interests, if you’re in a relationship or not, and what other pages you look at on the web. This data allows advertisers to target the more than one billion Facebook visitors a day. It’s no wonder the company has ballooned in size to a $500 billion behemoth in the five years since its I.P.O.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneOpinion--19bv1&quot; data-reactid=&quot;112&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;113&quot;&gt;The more data it has on offer, the more value it creates for advertisers. That means it has no incentive to police the collection or use of that data — except when negative press or regulators are involved. Facebook is free to do almost whatever it wants with your personal information, and has no reason to put safeguards in place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneOpinion--19bv1&quot; data-reactid=&quot;116&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;117&quot;&gt;For a few years, Facebook’s developer platform hosted a thriving ecosystem of popular social games. Remember the age of Farmville and Candy Crush? The premise was simple: Users agreed to give game developers access to their data in exchange for free use of addictive games.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneOpinion--19bv1&quot; data-reactid=&quot;120&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;121&quot;&gt;Unfortunately for the users of these games, there were no protections around the data they were passed through Facebook to outside developers. Once data went to the developer of a game, there was not much Facebook could do about misuse except to call the developer in question and threaten to cut off the developer’s access. As the I.P.O. approached, and the media reported on allegations of misuse of data, I, as manager of the team responsible for protecting users on the developer platform from abuse of their data, was given the task of solving the problem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneOpinion--19bv1&quot; data-reactid=&quot;125&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;126&quot;&gt;In one instance, a developer appeared to be using Facebook data to automatically generate profiles of children, without their consent. When I called the company responsible for the app, it claimed that Facebook’s policies on data use were not being violated, but we had no way to confirm whether that was true. Once data passed from the platform to a developer, Facebook had no view of the data or control over it. In other cases, developers asked for permission to get user data that their apps obviously didn’t need — such as a social game asking for all of your photos and messages. People rarely read permissions request forms carefully, so they often authorize access to sensitive information without realizing it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneOpinion--19bv1&quot; data-reactid=&quot;129&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;130&quot;&gt;At a company that was deeply concerned about protecting its users, this situation would have been met with a robust effort to cut off developers who were making questionable use of data. But when I was at Facebook, the typical reaction I recall looked like this: try to put any negative press coverage to bed as quickly as possible, with no sincere efforts to put safeguards in place or to identify and stop abusive developers. When I proposed a deeper audit of developers’ use of Facebook’s data, one executive asked me, “Do you really want to see what you’ll find?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneOpinion--19bv1&quot; data-reactid=&quot;133&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;134&quot;&gt;The message was clear: The company just wanted negative stories to stop. It didn’t really care how the data was used.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneOpinion--19bv1&quot; data-reactid=&quot;137&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;138&quot;&gt;When Russians decided to target Americans during the 2016 election, they didn’t buy TV or newspaper ads, or hire a skywriter. They turned to Facebook, where their content reached at least 126 million Americans. The fact that Facebook prioritized data collection over user protection and regulatory compliance is precisely what made it so attractive. Now the company is arguing that it should be allowed to regulate itself to prevent this from happening again. My experience shows that it should not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneOpinion--19bv1&quot; data-reactid=&quot;141&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;142&quot;&gt;Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, mentioned in an October interview with Axios that one of the ways the company uncovered Russian propaganda ads was by identifying that they had been purchased in rubles. Given how easy this was, it seems clear the discovery could have come much sooner than it did — a year after the election. But apparently Facebook took the same approach to this investigation as the one I observed during my tenure: react only when the press or regulators make something an issue, and avoid any changes that would hurt the business of collecting and selling data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneOpinion--19bv1&quot; data-reactid=&quot;145&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;146&quot;&gt;This makes for a dangerous mix: a company that reaches most of the country every day and has the most detailed set of personal data ever assembled, but has no incentive to prevent abuse. Facebook needs to be regulated more tightly, or broken up so that no single entity controls all of its data. The company won’t protect us by itself, and nothing less than our democracy is at stake.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Exactis Data Breach May Have Leaked Personal Data of Almost Every American Adult</title>
<link>https://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-new-data-breach-may-have-exposed-personal-information-of-almost-every-american-adult-2018-06-27</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;A little-known Florida company may have exposed the personal data of nearly every American adult, according to a new report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/exactis-database-leak-340-million-records/&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;Wired reported Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; that Exactis, a Palm Coast, Fla.-based marketing and data-aggregation company, had exposed a database containing almost 2 terabytes of data, containing nearly 340 million individual records, on a public server. That included records of 230 million consumers and 110 million businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It seems like this is a database with pretty much every U.S. citizen in it,” security researcher Vinny Troia, who discovered the breach earlier this month, told Wired. “I don’t know where the data is coming from, but it’s one of the most comprehensive collections I’ve ever seen,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-the-number-of-data-breaches-is-soaring-in-one-chart-2018-02-26&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;How the number of data breaches is soaring — in one chart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the database apparently does not include credit-card numbers or Social Security numbers, it does include phone numbers, email and postal addresses as well as more than 400 personal characteristics, such as whether a person is a smoker, if they own a dog or cat, their religion and a multitude of personal interests. Even though no financial information was included, the breadth of personal data could make it possible to profile individuals or help scammers steal identities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troia told Wired that he was easily able to access the database on the internet, and in theory, plenty of other people could have too. He said he warned Exactis and the FBI about the vulnerability, and the data is no longer publicly accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also see:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/at-what-point-should-you-be-concerned-about-a-data-breach-2018-04-03&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;Everything you wanted to know about data breaches, privacy violations and hacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.exactis.com/&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;On its website&lt;/a&gt;, Exactis said it maintained 3.5 billion consumer, business and digital records, including “demographic, geographic, firmographic, lifestyle, interests, CPG, automotive, and behavioral data.” The company said it has data on 218 million individuals and 110 million U.S. households.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are about 325 million residents in the U.S., with about 244 million adults and 126 million households, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactis did not immediately respond when asked to confirm the breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If confirmed, the data leak would be one of the largest in history, and far bigger than the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/regulators-in-8-states-order-equifax-to-improve-its-cybersecurity-2018-06-27&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;Equifax data breach last year&lt;/a&gt; that exposed the personal information of about 148 million consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2016 breach of AdultFriendFinder exposed the data of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/friendfinder-breach-may-have-exposed-412-million-users-data-2016-11-14&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;more than 412 million accounts&lt;/a&gt;, while Yahoo’s 2013 hack exposed the personal data of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-triples-estimate-of-breached-accounts-to-3-billion-1507062804&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;about 3 billion accounts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While technically not a breach, Facebook Inc. &lt;span class=&quot;quote up bgQuote&quot; data-channel=&quot;/quotes/zigman/9962609/composite&quot; data-bgformat=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;qt-chip trackable&quot; data-fancyid=&quot;XNASStockFB&quot; href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fb&quot; data-track-mod=&quot;MW_story_quote&quot;&gt;FB, &lt;span class=&quot;bgPercentChange&quot;&gt;+0.20%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;   said in March that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-cult-of-facebook-2018-03-23&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;most of its 2 billion users&lt;/a&gt; had their personal data “improperly shared” without their permission, including about 87 million profiles that were scraped by Cambridge Analytica.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Twitter Will Show Who Pays for Ads and How Much They Spend</title>

<description>&lt;aside class=&quot;left-column&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;text-to-speech&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LISTEN TO ARTICLE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;share-article-button&quot; data-variation=&quot;basic-article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHARE THIS ARTICLE&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter Inc. said it will show detailed information about advertisers on the social-media service, addressing concerns from lawmakers that the company let foreign meddlers run rampant during the U.S. presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Starting on Thursday, anyone will be able to search for a Twitter account and see all the ads it has run in the past seven days. For U.S. political advertisers, users will be able to see billing information, ad spending, demographic targeting data and the number of times tweets have been viewed. Twitter had been planning to create this &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-24/twitter-adopts-advertising-transparency-rules-amid-russia-probe&quot; title=&quot;Twitter Shows Who Pays for Ads Amid Election Meddling Probe (3)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;transparency center&quot;&lt;/a&gt; since last October. Facebook Inc. has introduced similar features.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes are part of Twitter’s broader efforts to clean up its service after lawmakers berated the company for failing to discover Russian influence peddling through fake accounts and divisive ads during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Earlier this week, the company began requiring more &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-26/twitter-ramps-up-fight-against-abuse-and-malicious-bots&quot; title=&quot;Twitter Ramps Up Fight Against Abuse and Malicious Bots&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;authentication&lt;/a&gt; from users. In May, it rolled out &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/twitter-rolls-out-political-ad-rules-ahead-of-midterm-elections&quot; title=&quot;Twitter Rolls Out Political Ad Rules Ahead of Midterm Elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;stricter rules&lt;/a&gt; that require advertisers running political campaign ads for federal elections to identify themselves and certify they are located in the U.S. The company has also banned ads from accounts owned by Russia Today and Sputnik.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Social-media companies are rushing to regulate themselves as Congress works on new rules for digital political ads that have so far benefited from little oversight. Senators Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, and Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, have introduced the &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2018-04-10/twitter-follows-facebook-in-endorsing-senate-s-honest-ads-act&quot; title=&quot;Click to view webpage.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Honest Ads Act&lt;/a&gt; to subject online political ads to similar disclosure rules that govern TV and radio. Twitter and Facebook have &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2018-04-10/twitter-follows-facebook-in-endorsing-senate-s-honest-ads-act&quot; title=&quot;Twitter Follows Facebook, Endorses Senate’s ‘Honest Ads Act’ (2)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;endorsed&lt;/a&gt; the Honest Ads Act.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How to Make Everything Ourselves: Open Modular Hardware</title>
<link>http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2012/12/how-to-make-everything-ourselves-open-modular-hardware.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2012/12/how-to-make-everything-ourselves-open-modular-hardware.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A modular system unites the advantages of standardisation (as parts can be produced cheaply in large amounts) with the advantages of customisation (since a large diversity of unique objects can be made with relatively few parts). Modularity can be found to a greater or lesser extent in many products (like bicycles and computers) and systems (like trains and logistics), but the best examples of modular systems are toys: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LEGO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meccano&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Meccano&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erector_Set&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Erector&lt;/a&gt; (which is now the brand name of Meccano in the US).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEGO, Meccano and Erector are composed of relatively few elementary building blocks, which can be used to build various objects. The parts can then be disassembled and re-used to build something completely different. Apart from the elementary buildings blocks, these manufacturers have produced many more specific building blocks, which are less versatile, but further increase customisation possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017ee6156f1c970d-pi&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e0099229e88833017ee6156f1c970d&quot; title=&quot;Afmetingen lego bouwstenen&quot; src=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017ee6156f1c970d-500wi&quot; alt=&quot;Afmetingen lego bouwstenen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the building blocks in a set of LEGO, Meccano or Erector fit together because they are designed according to a set of specific rules. The holes (Meccano and Erector) or studs (LEGO) have a precise diameter and are spaced apart at specific distances. In addition, the dimensions of the building blocks are precisely matched to each other. The long lasting success of LEGO, Meccano and Erector (which appeared on the market in 1947, 1902 and 1911 respectively) is based on the fact that those rules have never changed. All new buildings blocks that were added in the course of the years are compatible with the existing ones. Today, kids can expand their collection of these toys with that of their parents or grandparents, and they are worth as much on the second hand market as they are worth new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grid Beam, Bit Beam, Open Beam, Maker Beam and Contraptor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same principle could be applied to everyday objects, from coffeemakers to furniture, gadgets, cars and renewable energy systems. All you need is a standardisation in design. The design rules can be very simple, as is the case with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gridbeam.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Grid Beam&lt;/a&gt;. This modular construction system, which was developed in 1976, is based on beams with a simple geometry and a repetitive hole-pattern. The beams can be made of wood, aluminium, steel, or any other material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017c347227d0970b-pi&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e0099229e88833017c347227d0970b&quot; title=&quot;Grid beam high sleeper&quot; src=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017c347227d0970b-500wi&quot; alt=&quot;Grid beam high sleeper&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of the simplicity of the design, a great variety of objects can be constructed. Grid Beam has been used to make all kinds of furniture, greenhouses, constructions for workshops and industrial processes, windmills, wheelbarrows, agricultural machinery, vehicles, sheds and buildings (a book about the system was published in 2009, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gridbeam.com/a-revolution-in-diy-engineering/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;can be found online&lt;/a&gt;). Grid Beam was inspired by a system envisioned by Ken Isaacs in the 1950s, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.publiccollectors.org/CompletePublications.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Living Structures&lt;/a&gt;, which used similar beams but contained only a few holes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017ee6159c81970d-pi&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e0099229e88833017ee6159c81970d&quot; title=&quot;Grid beam wheelbarrow&quot; src=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017ee6159c81970d-500wi&quot; alt=&quot;Grid beam wheelbarrow&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In recent years, several systems have appeared that use a very similar set of rules, based on a repetitive hole pattern. &lt;a href=&quot;http://bitbeam.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bit Beam&lt;/a&gt; is basically a scaled-down version of Grid Beam, aimed at building smaller structures in balsa-wood, like a laptop stand or a prototype device. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.contraptor.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Contraptor&lt;/a&gt; uses a similar approach, but is aimed at providing structural metal frames for DIY 3D-printers, milling machines, or robotics. &lt;a href=&quot;http://openbeamusa.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OpenBeam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10540?&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MakerBeam&lt;/a&gt; are also modular construction systems based on very simple rules. These are not based on a hole-pattern, but use T-slot aluminium profiles. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1397854503/makeblock-next-generation-of-construct-platform&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Makeblock&lt;/a&gt; combines both approaches and includes electronic modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017d3ea10e98970c-pi&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e0099229e88833017d3ea10e98970c&quot; title=&quot;Bitbeam&quot; src=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017d3ea10e98970c-500wi&quot; alt=&quot;Bitbeam&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of these construction systems are limited to the design of frameworks. There is one system, however, that offers much more possibilities, because it is based on a more sophisticated set of rules: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openstructures.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OpenStructures&lt;/a&gt;. The project was kicked off in Brussels in 2007. Unlike all the projects above, OpenStructures is still in an experimental phase. However, it is interesting enough to look at in more detail, because it best shows where modular construction systems may be headed in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenStructures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first basic rule of OpenStructures is shared with Grid Beam and similar systems: all parts are connected to each other in such a way that they can be easily disassembled, using bolts and screws rather than nails or glue. However, the OpenStructures design &quot;language&quot; is different: it is based on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://openstructures.net/pages/9&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OS Grid&lt;/a&gt;, which is built around a square of 4x4 cm and is scalable. The squares can be further subdivided or put together to form larger squares, without losing inter-compatibility. The illustration below shows nine complete squares of each 4x4 cm put together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017ee615d612970d-pi&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e0099229e88833017ee615d612970d&quot; title=&quot;OS grid&quot; src=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017ee615d612970d-700wi&quot; alt=&quot;OS grid&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The borders of the squares mark the cutting lines (which define the dimensions of square parts),  the diagonals determine the assembly points, and the circles define the common diameters. As is the case with LEGO, any modular part has to comply with at least one of these conditions in order to be compatible with other parts. Either the dimensions have to correspond with the horizontal and vertical lines, or the assembly points should be spaced according to the grid, or the diameters should be similar. Below is a part that fulfills two of three conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017c347271cd970b-pi&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e0099229e88833017c347271cd970b&quot; title=&quot;Compatibel onderdeel&quot; src=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017c347271cd970b-500wi&quot; alt=&quot;Compatibel onderdeel&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this set of rules is more sophisticated than that of the Grid Beam system, complicated it is not. Nevertheless, it allows for the design of a much larger variety of objects, not just square or rectangular frames. Over the course of five years, OpenStructures has yielded objects ranging from household devices to cargo bicycles, suitcases and furniture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open versus Closed Modular Systems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of the similarities, there is one fundamental difference between modular construction systems such as OpenStructures, Grid Beam and Contraptor, and modular toys such as LEGO, Meccano and Erector. The first group consists of &quot;open&quot; modular systems, where everyone is free to design and produce parts, while the second consists of &quot;closed&quot; modular systems, where all parts are designed and produced by one manufacturer. Closed modular systems produce uniform parts. For instance, all LEGO building blocks are made of plastic. LEGO does not produce building blocks made of wood, aluminium, glass or ceramics. There is a limited range of colours. And because LEGO is a closed system, nobody else is allowed to produce LEGO pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017ee618926c970d-pi&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e0099229e88833017ee618926c970d&quot; title=&quot;Closed modular system&quot; src=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017ee618926c970d-350wi&quot; alt=&quot;Closed modular system&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017ee618935a970d-pi&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e0099229e88833017ee618935a970d&quot; title=&quot;Open modular system&quot; src=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017ee618935a970d-350wi&quot; alt=&quot;Open modular system&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There exist modular construction systems that operate according to the same principles, like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.8020.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;T-profiles&lt;/a&gt; made by 80/20 inc. However, in the modular construction systems that we have introduced above, everyone is allowed to design and produce parts, as long as these parts are compatible with the basic set of rules. We find the same approach with open software, like Linux (an operating system), OpenOffice (office software) or WordPress (a blogging platform). The computer code for these systems is being written by a large amount of people, who all build a part of something larger. Because all participants stick to a basic set of rules, a great amount of people can, independently of one another,  add parts that are inter-compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Consumer products based on an open modular system can foster rapid innovation, without the drawback of wasting energy and materials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An open modular system has many advantages over a closed modular system. Since anyone can design parts in an open system, it generates a much larger diversity of parts: they can be made in different colours and materials, and none of the producers can set a fixed price for all consumers. And because many designers constantly review, adapt and improve each others' work, innovation is accelerated. All open software systems described above are arguably better than their closed counterparts, and some of them have become more successful. A closed modular system only has one advantage: the one who holds the copyright makes a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sustainable Consumer Goods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modular construction systems encourage the re-use of physical parts, and thus form a sustainable alternative to our present-day system of producing consumer items. Most products that we buy end up in landfills or incinerators within a couple of years, at most. This is because the majority of manufacturers encourages consumers to replace their products as quickly as possible, either by designing objects that break down easily, or by introducing new generations of products which make the former generation of products obsolete. This approach not only generates a massive pile of waste, it squanders an equally massive amount of energy and raw materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Part of OS grid&quot; src=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017ee616b68d970d-500wi&quot; alt=&quot;Part of OS grid&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer products based on an open modular system can foster rapid innovation, without the drawback of wasting energy and materials. The parts of an obsolete generation of products can be used to design the next generation, or something completely different. Furthermore, modular objects have built-in repairability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open modular construction systems could greatly speed up the diffusion of low-technologies, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2011/05/pedal-powered-farms-and-factories.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pedal-powered machines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2011/07/solar-powered-factories.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;solar thermal collectors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/velomobiles/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;velomobiles&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2012/09/jobs-of-the-future-cargo-cyclist.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cargo cycles&lt;/a&gt;. Building a windmill or a cargo bike goes much faster when using modular parts than when using carpentry or welding, and there is no need for expensive tools or special skills. Mistakes can be easily corrected -- just unscrew the bolts and start again. It would also be interesting to see modular parts combined with an open hardware project such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.notechmagazine.com/2011/05/how-to-build-your-own-industrial-civilization.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Global Village Construction Set&lt;/a&gt;, which generates many interesting designs but makes limited use of modularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Circulation of Parts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;While eBay provides a circulation of objects, and cradle-to-cradle provides a circulation of materials, modular construction systems provide a circulation of parts and components&quot;, says Thomas Lommée, the creator of OpenStructures. &quot;Our ambition is to create puzzles instead of static objects. The system should generate objects of which it is not entirely clear anymore who designed them. An object evolves as it is taken in hands by more designers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017ee616d57b970d-pi&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Kitchen appliances openstructures&quot; src=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017ee616d57b970d-700wi&quot; alt=&quot;Kitchen appliances openstructures&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kitchen appliances that were designed in the context of the project are good examples. A couple of parts were initially made for a coffee grinder, were then used, together with new parts, by another designer to build a coffeemaker. This appliance was then further developed into a water purification device by a third designer. The plastic bottle that served as a water container was replaced by a cut through glass bottle containing a clay filter. Thomas Lommée: &quot;By adding or removing components, or by using them in a different manner, what you get is a family of objects&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cargo Cycle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another prototype that originated from the project, is a cargo cycle. The rear is a sawed through frame of a standard bicycle, the end of which is compatible with the OS Grid. This means that the front of the cycle can be built up in a modular way. Designer Jo Van Bostraeten used this opportunity to design both a cargo bicycle and a cargo tricycle (the latter is carrying a 3D-printer), and it doesn't end there. Together with Lommée, he also constructed a modular motor block. The unit consists of an electric motor and wheels, on top of which a similar unit can be placed that holds a battery. Since the units are compatible with the OS Grid, they can be coupled to the front of the cargo cycle, resulting in a completely modular motorised cargo vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017c3473a963970b-pi&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Openstructures cargo vehicles&quot; src=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017c3473a963970b-700wi&quot; alt=&quot;Openstructures cargo vehicles&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest &quot;family&quot; of objects to come out of the project is aimed at children. It is noteworthy that this collection arose from one component of the cargo cycle -- the container.  It is built up from modular parts that can be bolted together, and can thus be combined in different ways. A couple of designers got started with those parts, resulting in (among other things) a sled, a seat, a toy excavator, and a swing. When the child becomes an adolescent, the parts can be used to make a suitcase or a tool box, or become part of a cargo cycle that could &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2012/09/jobs-of-the-future-cargo-cyclist.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;make him or her some pocket money&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e0099229e88833017d3ed22c5c970c&quot; title=&quot;Open source objects&quot; src=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017d3ed22c5c970c-700wi&quot; alt=&quot;Open source objects&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More interesting than the objects themselves, is their user support system. Grid Beam is obviously a product from the pre-internet age. Those who want to copy a design are encouraged to look at a picture of someone else's creation and &quot;count the holes&quot;. OpenStructures, on the other hand, leans heavily on online user support. The re-use of parts is being facilitated by an online database that can be used in three ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;A Modular Database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you can request an overview of &lt;a href=&quot;http://openstructures.net/pages/14/structures&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;all objects&lt;/a&gt; that were designed based on the OS grid. The webpage for each object then shows you the parts and components from which it is made. Second, you can request an overview of &lt;a href=&quot;http://openstructures.net/pages/44/parts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;all parts&lt;/a&gt; that were designed based on the OS grid. The webpage for each of these shows you which components and objects they could serve. Third, you can request an overview of &lt;a href=&quot;http://openstructures.net/pages/11/components&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;all components&lt;/a&gt;. The webpage for each component shows you their parts and the objects they can be used for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Open modular construction does not mean that everyone should make their own consumer products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The webpage for each part, component and object also gives additional information: the dimensions, the materials, the designer's name, the licence and the order information. To add to this, all parts and components receive a serial number. This means that after a modular object is taken apart, the serial number of each part and component can be entered into the database to see what else can be made with it. Missing parts can be obtained via the database: either by ordering them online, by finding the address of a shop where they sell them, or by downloading the digital design and making them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not Everyone is a Designer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open modular construction does not mean that everyone should make their own consumer products. An object like a coffee maker or a workbench could be obtained in at least three ways. Firstly, the consumer can download the digital design and then assemble the object with parts that he or she buys, re-uses, or makes using a 3D-printer or laser cutter, whether at home or at a fab lab or tech shop. It can also happen in a more low-tech fashion, as is the case with Grid Beam: the consumer buys wood or metal beams, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2010/12/hand-powered-drilling-tools-and-machines.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;drills the holes himself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017d3eaa499a970c-pi&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e0099229e88833017d3eaa499a970c&quot; title=&quot;Modular parts water boiler&quot; src=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017d3eaa499a970c-500wi&quot; alt=&quot;Modular parts water boiler&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second option is that a company buys the license of the design (if it is not free) and converts it into a building kit, comparable to a kit from LEGO, Meccano or Erector. In this case, the consumer would not have to search for the parts himself, but he still assembles the product himself, just like he would assemble a piece of furniture by IKEA. Similarly, a company could offer a more general building kit, which can be used to make whatever one would like, similar to a box of basic LEGO bricks. Bit Beam, Contraptor, Open Beam, Maker Beam and, &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/8301-32973_3-57440288-296/after-more-than-30-years-grid-beam-modular-construction-system-comes-to-market/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recently&lt;/a&gt;, Grid Beam offer one or both of these options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third possibility is that a manufacturer places the object on the market as a finished, assembled product. The coffee maker or the workbench would then be sold and bought just as any other product today, but it can be disassembled after use, and its parts can be re-used for other objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic Model: who Produces the Parts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the design process behind OpenStructures and other open modular construction systems is identical to that of digital products such as Wikipedia, Linux or WordPress, there is also a fundamental difference. Computer code and digital text accumulate without any material costs. This is not the case with objects. This makes open modular hardware less easy, but it also creates  economic opportunities. It's hard to make money with open software or online writing. However, in the case of an open modular system for objects, someone has to provide the materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also important that the parts are produced by as many manufacturers as possible, so that they are available worldwide. Otherwhise, the shipping costs can be so high that a modular object becomes too expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017c347b73e6970b-pi&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e0099229e88833017c347b73e6970b&quot; title=&quot;Modular toaster&quot; src=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017c347b73e6970b-500wi&quot; alt=&quot;Modular toaster&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many opportunities to make money with an open modular construction model. A manufacturer can choose to produce a part in which they sees economic potential. Another manufacturer can choose to sell a building kit or a finished product of a design they think will sell. A designer can make money by uploading a design that might be free to download for personal use, but not for commercial use. A manufacturer that wants to commercialise this design, can then buy the licence from the designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craftsmen can focus on the design of exclusive, handmade parts in special materials, which are compatible with popular mass produced items. Others can start a fab lab or a tech shop where people can build their own modular objects for a monthly fee. In short, an open modular construction system offers economic opportunities for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborative Economy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is not our ambition to build a gigantic factory that produces all possible parts&quot;, Lommée notes. &quot;OpenStructures should not become a modular IKEA. Our ambition is the creation of a collective economic system, where one producer benefits from the production of another producer. Because parts which are made by one, can be used by another. What we would like to see, are streets full of little shops where everybody generates their own little part of a larger system, a collaborative economy where small, self-employed producers have their place. Not one big player that makes everything. The social dimension is very important.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017d3eaa4d36970c-pi&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e0099229e88833017d3eaa4d36970c&quot; title=&quot;Contraptor parts&quot; src=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017d3eaa4d36970c-500wi&quot; alt=&quot;Contraptor parts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If IKEA wants to sell a product that is compatible with our system, then that's fine with me. But the system can only work if it remains open. The larger it becomes, the easier it is for a small company or a craftsman to be a part of it. The ambition is to start a universal, collaborative puzzle that allows the widest possible range of people -- from craftsmen to multinationals -- to design, build and exchange the widest possible range of modular parts and components.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organising Re-use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from a design language (the OS grid) and an online database, OpenStructures also has set up a prototype of a warehouse in Brussels. This kind of place should become the hub for the organisation of the re-use of parts and components. Think a fab lab or tech shop, but then combined with the storage of modular parts. If a modular product is no longer needed, and the owner does not feel like using the parts to build something new, he or she brings it to one of these places, where it is taken apart, and its parts are stored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An open modular construction system offers economic opportunities for everybody&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other people could come to this place to buy parts or to use them on site to build something new. As Lommée says: &quot;Not everyone has to make their own products, but after its useful life, a modular product always comes into the hands of a group of people who like to make things.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compatibility between Open Modular Systems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is still in an experimental phase, OpenStructures is by far the most ambitious and complete open modular system designed to date. However, being a European project, it follows the international metric system, while the much older Grid Beam follows the imperial system. The systems are not compatible. With more and more open modular systems appearing, would it not be important to provide inter-compatibility between them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017d3eda36a7970c-pi&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e0099229e88833017d3eda36a7970c&quot; title=&quot;Makeblock&quot; src=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017d3eda36a7970c-500wi&quot; alt=&quot;Makeblock&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lommée doesn't think so: &quot;Most of these systems are designed for different applications. For instance, Contraptor aims at precision, because the parts are used to build robots and other sophisticated machines. Esthetics are clearly not important. I am a designer, so what interests me especially is whether or not a modular system can generate beautiful objects, things you would want to put in your interior. There is also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikispeed.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikispeed&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, which concentrates on the development of a modular car. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arduino.cc/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Arduino&lt;/a&gt; is aimed at electronics. I don't think that all of these modular systems have to be compatible with each other because the applications are very different.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017c347b782a970b-pi&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Open beam&quot; src=&quot;http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833017c347b782a970b-500wi&quot; alt=&quot;Open beam&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He goes on to explain why he chose the metric system. &quot;I have been doubting a lot about this. But in the end I decided that the metric system is easier to work with. And I think the world is big enough for two systems -- just look at the variety of energy standards which are in use. Somebody has developed a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.contraptor.org/forum/t-273404/contraptor-openstructures&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;European version of Contraptor&lt;/a&gt;, based on the metric system and compatible with the OS grid. And it is always possible to design a coupling between two systems, so that they can be used together. On the other hand, we live in a networked world where everything is connected and copied. This often means that when standards compete, only one survives. And this is not necessarily the best one. I'll keep my fingers crossed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>Reverting to traditional handicrafts is one way to sabotage the throwaway society. In this article, we discuss another possibility: the design of modular consumer products, whose parts and components could be re-used for the design of other products. Initiatives like OpenStructures, Grid Beam, and Contraptor combine the modularity of systems like LEGO, Meccano and Erector with the collaborative power of digital success stories like Wikipedia, Linux or WordPress. An economy based on the concept of re-use would not only bring important advantages in terms of sustainability, but would also save consumers money, speed up innovation, and take manufacturing out of the hands of multinationals. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A modular system unites the advantages of standardisation (as parts can be produced cheaply...</og:description>

<title>Former Equifax Manager Charged with Insider Trading</title>
<link>https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-115</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-115</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former Equifax manager with insider trading in advance of the company’s September 2017 announcement of a massive data breach that exposed Social Security numbers and other personal information of approximately 148 million U.S. customers.   This is the second case the SEC has filed arising from the Equifax data breach.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-40&quot;&gt;In March, the former chief information officer of Equifax’s U.S. business unit&lt;/a&gt; was charged with insider trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a complaint filed in federal court in Atlanta today, the SEC charged that Equifax software engineering manager Sudhakar Reddy Bonthu traded on confidential information he received while creating a website for consumers impacted by a data breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint, Bonthu was told the work was being done for an unnamed potential client, but based on information he received, he concluded that Equifax itself was the victim of the breach.  The SEC alleges that Bonthu violated company policy when he traded on the non-public information by purchasing Equifax put options.  Less than a week later, after Equifax publicly announced the data breach and its stock declined nearly 14 percent, Bonthu sold the put options and netted more than $75,000, a return of more than 3,500 percent on his initial investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonthu, 44, was terminated from Equifax in March after refusing to cooperate with an internal investigation into whether he had violated the company’s insider trading policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As we allege, Bonthu, who was entrusted with confidential information by his employer, misused that information to conclude that his company had suffered a massive data breach and then sought to illegally profit,” said Richard R. Best, Director of the SEC’s Atlanta Regional Office.  “Corporate insiders simply cannot abuse their access to sensitive information and illegally enrich themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a parallel proceeding, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia filed criminal charges against Bonthu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To settle the SEC’s civil charges, Bonthu has agreed to a permanent injunction and to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest.  The settlement is subject to court approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC’s investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Elizabeth Skola and Justin Jeffries.  The litigation is being led by Shawn Murnahan and Graham Loomis.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>We Should Be Building Cities for People, Not Cars (2016)</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The way we live is shaped by our infrastructure—the public spaces, building codes, and utilities that serve a city or region. It can act as the foundation for thriving communities, but it can also establish unhealthy patterns when designed poorly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col/&gt;&lt;col/&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;6.9778305621536&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;21.930324623911&quot;&gt;&lt;td readability=&quot;23.923990498812&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;14.851485148515&quot;&gt;For decades, San Francisco’s waterfront was dominated by the massive Embarcadero Freeway. The Ferry Building was hidden in the shadow of a grungy overpass, and the double decker highway blocked residents’ access to the bay all along the eastern edge of the peninsula. One local writer &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=-ywDBAAAQBAJ&amp;amp;lpg=PA144&amp;amp;ots=uB1n9Xv9K3&amp;amp;dq=William%20Thompson%20%20%22shunted%20pedestrians%20through%20a%20dark%2C%20sooty%20gauntlet%20between%20downtown%20and%20the%20San%20Francisco%20Bay%22&amp;amp;pg=PA145#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=William%20Thompson%20%20%22shunted%20pedestrians%20through%20a%20dark%2C%20sooty%20gauntlet%20between%20downtown%20and%20the%20San%20Francisco%20Bay%22&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the freeway “shunted pedestrians through a dark, sooty gauntlet between downtown and the San Francisco Bay&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, in 2002, the freeway was replaced with a palm-lined boulevard and a streetcar line down the middle. The Embarcadero was transformed from a fading industrial zone into a center of tourism and leisure. San Francisco’s stunning waterfront became a destination rather than just a place to pass through.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The turning point for the Embarcadero was the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake that destroyed the freeway. Demolition proposals had always been shot down due to fears that it would create unbearable traffic. The quake forced San Franciscans to live without the freeway, and they quickly discovered that the feared congestion never happened. Instead, the neighborhood saw a massive economic boost, and the new boulevard is one of the best parts of the city. By damaging the highway beyond repair, the quake was able to do what political pressure couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://postachio-images.s3.amazonaws.com/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/c6aa6c33-807b-47a8-b315-0530cf601a41/b03d431e-55b7-42b3-a96d-df571c48fbb6.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://postachio-images.s3.amazonaws.com/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/c6aa6c33-807b-47a8-b315-0530cf601a41/42f72a9b-f323-4523-b1ad-1358fda1794b.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;San Francisco’s Ferry Building, before and after the Embarcadero Freeway was torn down&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unfortunately, America’s inherited infrastructure is more like the old Embarcadero Highway than the boulevard that replaced it. Urban planners spent the 20th century building cities for cars, not people, and alternatives to driving have been systemically undervalued. This legacy has resulted in substandard health outcomes, missed economic opportunities, and a shortage of affordable housing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We can’t wait around for another earthquake to reverse generations of bad policy. Luckily, it doesn’t require a natural disaster to begin reshaping our infrastructure. Small changes can have an outsized impact in expanding alternatives for how people move around. Rebuilding our infrastructure to enable walking, cycling, and mass transit would bring health and economic benefits that far outweigh its price tag.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our infrastructure is making us sick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The American health care crisis is at its heart an urban design crisis. To get a sense for the toll our car-centric infrastructure has taken on our physical and mental well-being:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite its costs, driving remains the most common mode of travel in the US, at around&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/hhes/commuting/files/2014/acs-32.pdf&quot;&gt;85 percent of commuting trips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=0726UXcSEEsC&amp;amp;pg=PA46&amp;amp;lpg=PA46&amp;amp;dq=Roughly+one+out+of+every+six+American+workers+commutes+more+than+forty-five+minutes,+each+way&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=6GkbbrpgZ9&amp;amp;sig=lT2Vy_433DG8K7i7OHlBrnO5aKc&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiLvu-Rg7jOAhUH8mMKHcgEBdsQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=Roughly%20one%20out%20of%20every%20six%20American%20workers%20commutes%20more%20than%20forty-five%20minutes,%20each%20way&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;One out of six workers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;commutes more than 45 minutes each way, and private vehicles account for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://bikeleague.org/content/national-household-travel-survey-short-trips-analysis&quot;&gt;60% of trips a mile or shorter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. But it’s not drivers’ fault; rather, our infrastructure encourages — and in many cases forces — us to depend on cars. Our communities are built at the scale of highways rather than humans. Expressways slice through neighborhoods, and widened streets prioritize the flow of cars over making it worth traveling to their destinations. In the 1950s and 60s,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://urbanomnibus.net/2015/06/the-scythe-of-progress-must-move-northward-urban-renewal-on-the-upper-west-side/&quot;&gt;large scale demolitions&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;were commonplace in order to make way for fast moving motorized traffic, and communities from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://untappedcities.com/2013/12/18/5-things-in-nyc-we-can-blame-on-robert-moses/&quot;&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_vault/2014/07/25/transit_history_in_los_angeles_a_1906_map_of_the_city_s_streetcar_system.html&quot;&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;have never fully recovered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People choose to drive despite its costs because they lack reasonable alternatives. Unfortunately, this isn’t an accident of history. Our transportation system has been overly focused on automobile traffic flow as its metric of success. This single-minded focus has come at the cost of infrastructure that supports alternative ways to travel. Traffic flow should instead be one goal out of many. Communities would be far healthier if our infrastructure actively encouraged walking, cycling, and other forms of transportation rather than subsidizing driving and ignoring alternatives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://postachio-images.s3.amazonaws.com/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/c6aa6c33-807b-47a8-b315-0530cf601a41/160edf3b-a301-4027-96da-0d8fc741f6f0.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Walkability has major economic benefits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;It makes financial sense for cities to invest in walkability. There is a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jpe.sagepub.com/content/24/3/317.abstract&quot;&gt;scarcity of walkable neighborhoods&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;in the US housing market, and this unmet demand is reflected in the prices people are willing to pay for housing in those cities that embrace a pedestrian-friendly model. Cities that remove barriers to pedestrian-centric development have an economic edge on those that do not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Having a critical mass of pedestrians signals that a neighborhood is safe and interesting, which in turn draws more people into that area. This creates a positive feedback loop — with people and opportunities nearby, it becomes increasingly attractive for businesses and residents to move in. Walkability&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redfin.com/blog/2009/08/new-study-shows-one-point-of-walk-score-worth-up-to-3000.html&quot;&gt;correlates&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;with property values so closely that it has become standard practice in real estate to advertise a home’s “walk score&quot;, because a high grade earns a premium. Websites like Zillow and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://Apartments.com&quot;&gt;Apartments.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.walkscore.com/professional/case-studies.php&quot;&gt;offer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;calculations for commute length and walkability to everyday destinations like grocery stores, and it is common for real estate agents to advertise the walk score as a major selling point.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Embarcadero in San Francisco is a perfect illustration of how transitioning away from car-centric infrastructure can revitalize a neighborhood. When the highway was removed in 2002,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://reclaimingoldwestbroad.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/chapter-9-appendix-1-related-articles-and-case-studies.pdf&quot;&gt;the area experienced a massive economic boost&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Within four years, housing in the area increased by 51% and jobs increased by 23%, and by freeing up land for development, the highway removal has also increased the city’s tax base.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Portland offers another helpful model. In contrast to most American cities, Portland has invested in multiple modes of transportation for decades. As a result, its residents drive 20% less than other major metropolitan areas, and the city has experienced economic benefits beyond just a rise in property values. “Portlanders save a bundle on cars and gas, [so] residents have more money to spend on other things they value, which in turn stimulates the local economy,&quot; said economist Joe Cortright in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.oregonlive.com/commuting/2009/09/pdxgreendividend.pdf&quot;&gt;Portland’s Green Dividend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Less driving leads to greater savings, and those savings flow to the local economy rather than distant oil producers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Walkability makes communities more affordable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Walkable, transit-friendly cities like New York, Chicago, and San Francisco are infamous for their high housing prices. However, when housing and transportation costs are considered together,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/f-kaid-benfield/how-transit-walkability-h_b_5704997.html&quot;&gt;these places are far more affordable than sprawling cities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. It is true that rents and property values decrease as you move farther from the city center, but the added costs of owning and operating a car quickly burns through whatever savings came from moving away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;This calculation is even more clear when you also consider the opportunity cost of driving. Time spent in traffic means you have less time to do other things that you care about. “There’s a simple rule of thumb: Every 10 minutes of commuting results in 10% fewer social connections,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/04/16/070416fa_fact_paumgarten&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam. “Commuting is connected to social isolation, which causes unhappiness.&quot; Workers with long commutes are also less productive. Employee absenteeism would be about&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.academia.edu/277760/Are_workers_with_a_long_commute_less_productive_An_empirical_analysis_of_absenteeism&quot;&gt;15–20%&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;less if all workers had a negligible commute, and workers with a long commute are more likely to leave early or arrive late.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://postachio-images.s3.amazonaws.com/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/c6aa6c33-807b-47a8-b315-0530cf601a41/565a9b2b-fec5-42fc-bedc-25b31dded3f5.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Affordable housing would be far more attainable if our infrastructure encouraged walking and alternative forms of transportation. Parking minimums are one example of how car-centric infrastructure works against this goal. A standard parking spot occupies as much square footage as a small studio apartment, and that’s without factoring in the driveway space required for maneuvering into the spot. All in all, shops in California are required to provide 288 square feet of parking space for every 250 square feet of retail space — 115% more space is required to accommodate the parking for any new retail development. In Los Angeles,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.citylab.com/commute/2015/12/parking-los-angeles-maps-study/418593/&quot;&gt;3.3 spaces exist for every car in the city&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Other states have similar or worse requirements. As a result, acreage devoted to parking hovers around&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Environment/E_Casestudy/E_casestudy2.htm&quot;&gt;30% of the ground area in the core of the average sun belt city&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This is area that could otherwise be used for some other productive use. If we could make even a tiny dent in the amount of space consumed by parking, we could greatly improve the affordability of cities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These parking minimums not only consume valuable space — they also induce more driving. With so much area devoted to parking, the distance between destinations increases, which in turn increases the necessity of driving. With more drivers doing more traveling, more parking spots are needed to accommodate their cars, continuing this vicious cycle. On the bright side, this also means that the benefits of changing these requirements are compounding. If we loosen requirements, we would also see a reduction in demand for parking spots, because the demand for driving itself would decrease as destinations cluster closer together.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fun fact: SimCity was forced to pretend that all parking lots were underground, because the game would be “really boring if it was proportional in terms of parking lots&quot;. SimCity’s lead designer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/05/the-philosophy-of-simcity-an-interview-with-the-games-lead-designer/275724/&quot;&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, “I was blown away by how much more space was parking lot rather than actual store. That was kind of a problem, because we were originally just going to model real cities … We had to do the best we could do and still make the game look attractive.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://postachio-images.s3.amazonaws.com/0bd25fcc-8ab1-40fe-8eef-bcafaae885c1/c6aa6c33-807b-47a8-b315-0530cf601a41/eee8af00-0f30-4896-af41-d65fe7c13a85.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tactical, concentrated improvements have an outsized impact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is feasible — both financially and politically — to make cities more walkable. Simple, low-cost improvements to features like&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://usa.streetsblog.org/2015/04/20/which-matters-more-a-bike-networks-connectivity-or-its-density/&quot;&gt;painted bike lanes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/conferences/2015/ActiveTransportation/Presentations/Janet%20Fulton.pdf&quot;&gt;wayfinding signs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=11&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjo2cnFj7rOAhXI7xQKHeZhDtgQFghUMAo&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Famericanhistory.si.edu%2Fblog%2Fsmashing-barriers-access-disability-activism-and-curb-cuts&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHKLn48DZJb37DQR_F8yjDJT9bGdQ&amp;amp;sig2=uriDBv2RDJNjBOTcmsBdUA&amp;amp;cad=rja&quot;&gt;curb cuts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/enviroatlas-des-moines-ia-estimated-percent-tree-cover-along-walkable-roads&quot;&gt;tree coverage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;have an disproportionate impact in transforming a car-dependent metropolis into human-scale, walkable neighborhoods. It is rare that cities find a goal that is both worthwhile and attainable, so urban planners should jump on this opportunity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Concentrated efforts to revitalize a small area can have a massive impact on an entire city. Mountain View, where I grew up, is a great example of this. When I was a kid, the town’s suburban sprawl required a car ride to get anywhere. However, in the past few years, resources have been directed towards making specific areas in and around downtown more walkable, and residents all over town have seen the benefits. In the summer, the main street is closed for weekly street festivals. Downtown parking spots have been replaced with cafe seating, separated from the road by planter beds. The Stevens Creek Trail connects otherwise isolated neighborhoods to these walkable zones, providing a corridor extending from the marshlands at the edge of the city into the heart of Mountain View and through three other neighboring cities. This corridor lets residents all over town benefit from efforts concentrated in a few small areas of the city. Most streets are still oriented towards cars, but few neighborhoods are more than a short stroll away from a connection to pedestrian-friendly zone. When used strategically, limited resources can revitalize the walkability of an entire community.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Every Sunday, Mountain View’s parking lot at the Caltrain station transforms into a farmers market&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brightly painted bike lanes on Market St have made San Francisco far more bike-friendly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Communities all around the country have begun to to experiment with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tacticalurbanismguide.com/about-the-project/&quot;&gt;retrofitting their built environments&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;in other small ways. The changes don’t have to be radical — they can be as small as repainting crosswalks or planting more trees to provide shade from the sun. California&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arb.ca.gov/planning/tsaq/cashout/cashout.htm&quot;&gt;requires&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;employers who provide parking for employees to offer a cash allowance in lieu of a parking space.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ams.usda.gov/press-release/national-farmers-market-manager-survey-shows-farmers-markets-continue-grow&quot;&gt;It has become common&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for downtowns to close Main Street for farmers markets and street fairs, and food trucks are a popular way to attract people to public spaces without the risk and hassle of setting up permanent shops. Improvements can range from grassroots efforts to add seating in public parks to city projects to reshape road networks and everything in between. Each community is different in its needs, resources, and existing infrastructure, so I find it particularly exciting to see how different towns come up with creative solutions that fit their particular situations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Walkability leads to better health outcomes, more affordable housing, and greater economic vitality. The best part is that easy, low-cost changes can go a long way in improving the options for how people move around their communities. Cities all around the country have begun to appreciate and capitalize on alternative modes of transportation, especially walking. We still have decades of auto-dependent land use trends to offset, but small shifts in the way our received infrastructure is designed can go a long way to making our neighborhoods more walkable — and in turn healthier, more affordable, and more vibrant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Bank for Student Hackers</title>

&lt;p name=&quot;b604&quot; id=&quot;b604&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--leading&quot;&gt;Kapaa High School isn’t an isolated case. In fact, high school students in general have no way to safely store money for clubs and non-profit activities. Schools, banks and local organizations lack the infrastructure to give students access to safe, tax-free and fee-exempt bank accounts. To do it yourself, you must incorporate and seek non-profit status which can take over a year and thousands of dollars in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d0d3&quot; id=&quot;d0d3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This puts students in a tough spot. Sure, you can secure the money to run a hackathon or an event with your club, but where do you put it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;50eb&quot; id=&quot;50eb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Today, I’m proud to share the launch of the&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackclub.com/bank&quot; data-href=&quot;https://hackclub.com/bank&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Hack Club Bank&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;. Students running events can now choose to store their money with Hack Club and get the full benefits of the backing of a 501(c)(3) non-profit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3463&quot; id=&quot;3463&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Here’s how it works. Students who choose to store their money with Hack Club get access to a dashboard where they can see a financial overview of their event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ab86&quot; id=&quot;ab86&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;From the dashboard, event organizers can do three crucial things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;8f82&quot; id=&quot;8f82&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Account balance:&lt;/strong&gt; See the event’s real-time account balance and transaction history&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;df00&quot; id=&quot;df00&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;When designing Hack Club Bank, one of the things most important to us was automating as much as possible&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; You should never have to wait for someone from Hack Club to find out your account balance. You should never have to wait for someone to issue an invoice for you. You should never have to go through a lengthy human-managed expense reimbursement process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;15ed&quot; id=&quot;15ed&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;That said, some things are inevitable. There’s nothing worse than needing something last-minute and having the person managing your financials go dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;75c8&quot; id=&quot;75c8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As part of Hack Club Bank, every event gets a dedicated point-of-contact and a best-effort 12 hour response window with a pre-defined escalation policy. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Hack Club will never go dark on events.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;af55&quot; id=&quot;af55&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;An underlying bank account with 501(c)(3) status, so donations to events are tax deductible&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li name=&quot;8b4d&quot; id=&quot;8b4d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;G Suite accounts for each team member, so everyone gets a custom email address like &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:megan@hackchicago.io&quot; data-href=&quot;mailto:megan@hackchicago.io&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;megan@hackchicago.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;388a&quot; id=&quot;388a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;While we’re still in the early days, we’ve already signed on four upcoming high school hackathons with combined budgets of over $50,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0f7b&quot; id=&quot;0f7b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To start, we’re allowing students already working with Hack Club to invite new events to Hack Club Bank. Down the road, we’ll be offering access to Hack Club Bank to the public through an open application process.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Amazon buys PillPack, an online pharmacy, for just under $1B</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/28/amazon-buys-pillpack-an-online-pharmacy-that-was-rumored-to-be-talking-to-walmart/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A week after &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/20/atul-gawande-the-doctor-and-writer-named-ceo-of-amazons-employee-healthcare-jv/&quot;&gt;appointing a CEO&lt;/a&gt; for its healthcare joint venture with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan, &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/amazon/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;amazon&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; today &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180628005614/en/&quot;&gt;announced an acquisition&lt;/a&gt; that underscores how it also hopes to have a more direct — and more commercial — role in the world of healthcare in the coming years. The company has purchased &lt;a href=&quot;http://pillpack.com&quot;&gt;PillPack&lt;/a&gt;, an online pharmacy the lets users buy medications in pre-made doses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terms of the deal have not been disclosed by Amazon, but sources close to the deal say it was for just under $1 billion. &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pillpack/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;pillpack&quot;&gt;PillPack&lt;/a&gt; had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/02/walmart-buying-pillpack-online-pharmacy-sources.html&quot;&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; been in talks with Walmart — one of Amazon’s big rivals — for an acquisition, and we confirmed that this was indeed the case. “But someone” — that is, Amazon — “came along offering more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/57127-96/company/profile#deal-history/103793-86T&quot;&gt;PitchBook&lt;/a&gt;, PillPack was last valued at $361 million after a round of funding in 2016. This deal is expected to close in the second half of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move (and that reported valuation hike) signal how heated the e-health market is becoming, and also how Amazon views it as a key frontier in its bid to be the go-to place for anything a consumer (or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-latest-ambition-to-be-a-major-hospital-supplier-1518517802&quot;&gt;medical organization&lt;/a&gt;) might want or need in the area of healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The might of Amazon in commerce plays a massive role in how the market is poised to develop: it buying the company is not only a signal of how PillPack will likely get scaled out (not least through Amazon’s healthcare JV) but also because of how other pharmacy companies will have to respond. So far, the market is punishing the rest for not already being where Amazon appears to be going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“PillPack’s visionary team has a combination of deep pharmacy experience and a focus on technology,” says &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jeff Wilke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Amazon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; CEO of Worldwide Consumer, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180628005614/en/&quot;&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt;. “PillPack is meaningfully improving its customers’ lives, and we want to help them continue making it easy for people to save time, simplify their lives, and feel healthier. We’re excited to see what we can do together on behalf of customers over time.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PillPack has a license to operate in all 50 states in the U.S. and has other accreditations such as URAC AND VIPPS, but it doesn’t seem to be operational in international markets. Its PharmacyOS — the system it has built that forms the basis of the company — is a platform that helps manage patient data and figure out how to balance meds together in safe doses for its customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge that the company is addressing is very real: The US is a huge consumer of medicines, and some of that has tipped into a large epidemic of abuse. While there are a lot of things that will have to happen to tackle that in the long and short term, at least helping to provide controlled doses of what patients are being prescribed is one aspect of how to tackle the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like TJ Parker, co-founder and CEO of PillPack, will be staying on to run the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“PillPack makes it simple for any customer to take the right medication at the right time, and feel healthier,” he said in a statement. “Together with Amazon, we are eager to continue working with partners across the healthcare industry to help people throughout the U.S. who can benefit from a better pharmacy experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PillPack, based in Manchester, New Hampshire, started out at Techstars in Boston in 2013, when it was still led by Katie Rae, and over the years it had raised $123 million with investors, including Accel, Accomplice, Charles River Ventures and Menlo Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;FeatureByline&quot;&gt;By &lt;strong&gt;Jake Edge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 27, 2018
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Archives/ConferenceByYear/#2018-PyCon&quot;&gt;PyCon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python 3 adoption has clearly picked up over the last few years, though there is still a long way to go. Big Python-using companies tend to have a whole lot of Python 2.7 code running on their infrastructure and Facebook is no exception. But Jason Fried came to PyCon 2018 to describe what has happened at the company over the last four years or so—it has gone from using almost no Python 3 to it becoming the dominant version of Python in the company. He was instrumental in helping to make that happen and his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4SS9yVWJYA&quot;&gt;talk [YouTube video]&lt;/a&gt; may provide other organizations with some ideas on how to tackle their migration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fried started working at Facebook in 2013 and he quickly found that he needed to teach himself Python because it was much easier to get code reviewed if it was in Python. At some point later, he found that he was the driving force behind Python 3 adoption at Facebook. He never had a plan to do that, it just came about as he worked with Python more and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/758315/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.lwn.net/images/2018/pycon-fried-sm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; alt=&quot;[Jason Fried]&quot; title=&quot;Jason Fried&quot; width=&quot;227&quot; height=&quot;280&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He started out by being active in the internal Python group. He was often the first to answer questions that came up. He eventually became famous (&quot;or maybe infamous&quot;) with the Pythonistas at Facebook because, when he saw a problem with how the language was being used, he didn't ask permission, he simply fixed it. That works at Facebook because there is no real top-down hierarchy of control; everyone has as much power to back out a change you make as you have to make the change to begin with. Over time, his changes built up credibility within the Facebook Python community that would serve him well in the migration process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing something like the Python language version at &quot;Facebook scale&quot; was going to take some time and a lot of diplomacy, he said. He wanted to tell the &quot;story about how I and couple of engineers used our free time, with no authority whatsoever, and made Python 3 the dominant version at Facebook.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013, there was rudimentary support for Python 3.3 at Facebook. It was there as part of a task for adding Python 3 support to the build system. But that task was blocked on Python 3 support in the Facebook libraries, which was in turn blocked by no Python 3 support in the build system. It was something of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22&quot;&gt;catch-22&lt;/a&gt;; Python 3 was &quot;available&quot; but nothing in the Facebook environment supported it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, there was lots of negative sentiment about Python 3 at Facebook in 2013. The overall thinking was that the company would simply stay on Python 2.7 forever. There was talk of jumping ship to another language entirely. Even he said (in an internal group) that Python 3 would never happen at Facebook. Only one person challenged him on that statement and suggested that he do something about it; at the time, he ignored the suggestion, but it did stick in his head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Some hope&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was, actually, some hope, he said. In January 2013, the four imports from &lt;tt&gt;__future__&lt;/tt&gt; (&lt;tt&gt;print_function&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;division&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;absolute_imports&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;unicode_literals&lt;/tt&gt;) were required by a &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)&quot;&gt;linter&lt;/a&gt;&quot; that was being used. They were added in an attempt to extend the life of the Python 2 code base. They were added everywhere in order to quiet the linter, which ended up making it easier to convert modules to Python 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://thrift.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Apache Thrift&lt;/a&gt; framework for serialization and remote procedure calls is &quot;used everywhere&quot; at Facebook. Since it was Python 2-only, it was a core blocker. But adding Python 3 support was popular in a poll for new Thrift features that the Facebook Thrift group had run. He voted for it, but not because he was on the Python 3 bandwagon at that point; he thought the Python 2 interface needed a refactor as it looked like it had come from Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His thinking started to switch when he saw Guido van Rossum give a talk at Yelp in San Francisco on something called &quot;Tulip&quot;, which is what eventually became the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;asyncio&lt;/tt&gt; module&lt;/a&gt;. He had always been a fan of asynchronous programming in Python, but found that it was fragmented because of the differences between the frameworks (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twistedmatrix.com/&quot;&gt;Twisted&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gevent.org/&quot;&gt;gevent&lt;/a&gt;) that provided it. Tulip looked like it would make asynchronous I/O interoperable rather than fragmented. Before that talk was even over, he was communicating with the Facebook Thrift team, suggesting that Thrift should simply support Tulip for Python 3, rather than wait for Twisted, gevent, and others to port to Python 3. A few days later, the Thrift team published a roadmap that showed Python 3 and Tulip support coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of those arrived in early 2014, but then nothing happened for six months; users did not show up, they had no plans to show up, and they, in fact, did not know about the changes at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A new project&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 2014, he started a project to rewrite a service that he had inherited. He started planning to do it using gevent and Python 2, but then realized it would be obsolete at the time it was written if he did so. In order for something to change, someone needs to be the first one; for Facebook and Python 3, that was him. &quot;For Python 3 in your organization, I think that person should be you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he started his project using Python 3 and &quot;everything was broken&quot;; it was no wonder that no one was using Python 3. The build system would not even build his code and all of the third-party wheel packages were only available for Python 2. When he finally fixed enough things to allow his service to be built, it would immediately fail when it was run—someplace deep in the guts of the code that sets up service entry points in the Facebook system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in order to get his code running, he had to fix everything else; he rebuilt hundreds of third-party wheels so that they would work with both Python versions and he had to make any internal libraries be 2/3 compatible. Every day, though, someone would commit a Python 2-only change into one of his dependencies. Not surprisingly, he got tired of fixing regressions. One solution would be to force Python 3 compliance within the organization, but Facebook is not a place where that is possible. But, if you act like you have some authority, people will start to believe that you do, indeed, have that authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He used up a lot of his social capital to add &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes&quot;&gt;Pyflakes&lt;/a&gt; linting into the build process. He was able to justify adding it because there already was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/&quot;&gt;PEP 8&lt;/a&gt; linter, but Pyflakes would address other code quality issues; in addition, Pyflakes had few false positives so it did not overly irritate the developers. He set things up so that Pyflakes would run on all code that was put up for review, first for Python 2 and then for Python 3. That helped spread the job of keeping Python 3 compatibility out to all of the developers and not just him, which allowed him to make progress with his project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on, he had to be responsive to help people understand that &quot;no, the linter is not wrong&quot; and that there was value to making the code work with Python 3. If the developers had started believing that moving to Python 3 was difficult, they would fall back on the &quot;let's stay with Python 2 forever&quot; mindset. He made it easy for developers to do the right thing with respect to keeping the code running on Python 3. It was easier to just &quot;shut the linter up&quot; and, by extension, him, than it was to complain about it, so most developers just did so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Education&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that in place, he had stopped the bleeding, but little or no progress toward running more Python 3 at Facebook was being made. He joined the team that did training on Python programming for new employees at Facebook. The linters already complained if the code was not compatible with 2 and 3, but he wanted to get to a point where 2/3 compatible code was only written for legacy projects and that new code should be written in Python 3. Once again he took matters into his own hands: in 2015, he changed the slides for the new employee Python class to make that statement. The idea was that at some unknown point in the future, Facebook will want to switch to Python 3, so writing Python 2-only code at this point makes no sense since it will have to be rewritten someday. He taught new hires that all of this should just work with the Facebook infrastructure and build systems and that if it didn't, they should file a bug or try to fix it themselves. &quot;Strangely enough, that's what happened.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2015, he &quot;finally shipped&quot; his project. He spent most of the rest of the year telling people how much better it was and why they should switch to using Python 3 where they could. Over the year, various allies in the effort to switch to Python 3 at Facebook made themselves known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those allies was Łukasz Langa, who had &quot;somehow convinced Instagram to move to Python 3&quot;. In 2016, he and Langa formed a brand new team in Facebook to shepherd Python within the company, which they dubbed &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ministry_of_Silly_Walks&quot;&gt;The Ministry of Silly Walks&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. Because they were &quot;the Python team&quot;, the &quot;perceived authority&quot; he mentioned earlier worked; people assumed they could make decisions about Python at Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, he was seeing slow but steady growth in the amount of Python 3 that was being run at the company. There was mention of it in meetings and he regularly heard of new projects that were using it. The tide of opinion had changed at Facebook even though Python 3 was not the default and projects needed to actively choose to use it. By May 2016, he signaled his intention to switch the build system default to Python 3, which was overwhelmingly supported so he made that switch a few days later—with no ill effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of 2016, there was a post from a project team that reported its results in switching to Python 3. The developers simply ran &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.html&quot;&gt;2to3&lt;/a&gt; on the code and fixed a few things that it complained about. When they ran the resulting code, they found it was 40% faster and used half the memory. This points to a persistent myth that Fried has heard: Python 3 is slower than Python 2. That may have been true for earlier releases of Python 3, but it is definitely not true now, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Nice things&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2017, Instagram finished its migration to Python 3 and Facebook was reaping the benefits of this &quot;glorious future where you can have nice things&quot;. Upgrades of Python versions were not particularly scary and brought new features that could be used. Facebook developers now focus on problems like using the new static typing features or migrating services to use &lt;tt&gt;asyncio&lt;/tt&gt;. &quot;Python at Facebook is fun again.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem now is that everyone is asking when Python 2 support can be retired. When there are regressions in the Python 2 support for a library or module, it is common to hear developers ask if those users can simply move to Python 3. It is the reverse of the problem he had a few years prior. &quot;Oh what a wonderful world in which I live.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He showed a graph of the Facebook service entry points in Python over time, starting in Q3 of 2015 where there were four total Python 3 entry points. At the time of the switch defaulting to Python 3 in mid-2016, Facebook already had 4% of its entry points as Python 3. In March 2018, it crossed over the 50% line; in mid-May, when he gave the talk, it was 55% of the &quot;tens of thousands of Facebook entry points&quot; that were running Python 3. At Facebook it is now embarrassing to have code that only runs on Python 2, Fried said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then reviewed the process. He noted that you have to do more than just build something new; you have to lead developers to it by &quot;being the change you want to see&quot;. You should get other people to help, even if they don't know they are helping, which is where linters and unit tests come into play. It is important to educate new hires for where you are heading. Once you get there, or some of the way there, celebrate by enjoying the &quot;nice things&quot;: write some &quot;awesome stuff in Python 3&quot;. Seeing how the new features can be used will make others want to convert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He fielded some questions from the audience. One asked how they might make this happen in a more traditional, hierarchical organization. Fried thought that might actually be easier since, instead of thousands of developers that need to be convinced, it should be possible to work up the management chain starting with a manager who recognizes the benefits. It could also be harder if the culture is conservative, but focusing on code quality improvements may help there. Another question focused on code that is monolithic, rather than broken up into multiple entry points; for that Fried suggested looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66XoCk79kjM&quot;&gt;Instagram keynote [YouTube video]&lt;/a&gt; from PyCon 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was lots in the talk that other organizations can use, but it is clear that having an advocate and shepherd with a lot of perseverance will be important. Companies that are planning a conversion of this sort will likely want to have someone like Fried on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[I would like to thank LWN's travel sponsor, the Linux Foundation, for assistance in traveling to Cleveland for PyCon.]&lt;/p&gt;

<title>‘Everyone is breaking the law right now’: GDPR compliance is falling short</title>
<link>https://digiday.com/media/everyone-breaking-law-right-now-gdpr-compliance-efforts-falling-short/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://digiday.com/media/everyone-breaking-law-right-now-gdpr-compliance-efforts-falling-short/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The arrival of the General Data Protection Regulation a month ago led to a flurry of activity, clogging email inboxes and flooding people with tracking consent notices. But experts say much of that activity was for show because much of it fails to render companies compliant with GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the issue, experts say, is the vague regulation has been interpreted in wildly different ways. GDPR consent-request messages vary wildly across sites. There are default pre-ticked opt-ins, buried options that require users to hunt for them, consent banners with information only available at a further click but no button to reject, and implied consent approaches. Others have used what some industry execs refer to as “nuke buttons,” which let the user reject everything without explaining what they’re rejecting or what they’re agreeing to. Others have simply reskinned cookie-banner messages required under the existing ePrivacy directive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Many publishers [and marketers] seem to have shot themselves willfully, or ignorantly, in the foot,” said Adrian Newby, chief technology officer at Crownpeak, parent company to privacy vendor Evidon. “They have bombarded their audiences with entirely unnecessary and noncompliant consent and opt-in emails.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tumultuous few weeks after the law’s arrival on May 25, in which &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiday.com/media/gdpr-mayhem-programmatic-ad-buying-plummets-europe/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;programmatic ad volumes plummeted&lt;/a&gt; mostly as a result of Google’s last-minute GDPR policy changes, programmatic spending &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiday.com/marketing/month-gdpr-takes-effect-programmatic-ad-spend-started-recover/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;is returning&lt;/a&gt; to pre-GDPR levels. Jangled nerves are calming, but experts warn against feeling a false sense of security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pretty much everyone is breaking the law right now,” said Denmark-based media analyst Thomas Baekdal. “There is not a single consent dialogue box anywhere that is easy to understand. We [publishers] have not really realized how much this is going to hit us. Everyone is trying to make things work the way they used to, rather than thinking about privacy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The European Union is very aggressive about privacy. This won’t stop just because we have a found a way for people to ignore it. This is coming,” added Baekdal. “They’ll likely attack Google and Facebook first. That’s how it will start, but through that, we will realize that as publishers, we’re just as bad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GDPR has been criticized for being vague and open to interpretation, which is what led to such disparate consent-gaining methods. Publishers across Europe are divided between those that have taken softer legitimate interest-based approaches or opt-out methods to claim compliance, while others have gone the harder consent-based route that requires people to opt in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Bloomberg and Forbes appear to be taking strict active consent approaches, while others like the Guardian and MailOnline are running consent banners. Several publishers have divided explainers on their cookie use into those used for advertising and tracking, and those used for site analytics — though users aren’t always able to pick one and reject the other; in many cases, it’s all or nothing. Others are simply hoping to stay under the radar until they have figured out how to be compliant in a way that doesn’t damage the business model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Confusion will continue to reign, and until someone actually gets burned, everyone is trying to fly as close to the sun as possible,” said a publishing executive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But those who choose to do less now won’t necessarily be better off in the long run, according to some industry executives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just being compliant and talking to users in a legal language won’t take publishers very far and fail to make the best of the potential advantages GDPR is presenting to them,” said Alessandro De Zanche, independent publishing consultant. “Inaction will just play into the hands of the duopoly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many examples of businesses simply repurposing the existing EU cookie directive policy and running cookie banners at the base of sites, to which users can click “OK” to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“GDPR consent requires an affirmative action, which leads you to conclude you need an explicit yes button,” Newby said. “No data should be collected until the user says yes. But a lot of publishers have gotten confused and taken a more similar approach to ePrivacy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishers went on a soul-searching mission when ad blocking reached &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiday.com/uk/top-uk-publishers-losing-2-6-mil-year-ad-blocking/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;crisis levels&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. A lot of focus returned to ensuring the user experience wasn’t neglected for the sake of hitting short-term revenue targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With Y2K, there was so much freaking out,” said Brian Kane, co-founder and chief operating officer of ad tech vendor Sourcepoint. “But it came and went, and was never talked about it again. It’s the exact opposite with GDPR. It came on May 25, and it was the start of the conversation. We’re in conversations with publishers about how they approach consent, how they tie it with their subscriptions offerings and monetization strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Django Newbie Mistakes</title>
<link>https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/NewbieMistakes</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/NewbieMistakes</guid>
<description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;HithereHackerNews.ThispageisntpartofDjangosdocumentationitspartofthecommunitywiki.Thispageisalso13yearsoldandmanyofthethingslistedhereappliedonlyinincrediblyancientversionsofDjango.Djangosactualdocumentationcanbefoundatdocs.djangoproject.com.&quot;&gt;Hi there, Hacker News. This page isn't part of Django's documentation; it's part of the community wiki. This page is also 13 years old, and many of the things listed here applied only in incredibly ancient versions of Django. Django's actual documentation can be found at docs.djangoproject.com.&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Please feel free to share the things that tripped you up when you started with Django. We'll try to improve Django's error handling to catch such mistakes in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;POSTtoviewslosesPOSTdata&quot;&gt;POST to views loses POST data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Symptom&quot;&gt;Symptom&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've got a form that does a POST to some view, and the view doesn't get the POST data from the form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Probablecause&quot;&gt;Probable cause&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be missing the / at the end of the form &lt;code&gt;action&lt;/code&gt;. If that's the case, the &lt;code&gt;CommonMiddleware&lt;/code&gt; (check your &lt;code&gt;MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES&lt;/code&gt;) redirects to the exact name of the view - and that always includes a trailing slash. Because it does so by using the standard HTTP redirection through Location header, it can't pass on the POST data - and that's why it gets lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Solution&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always make sure that your form actions end with a slash, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wiki&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;form action=&quot;/registration/login/&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;input name=&quot;username&quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;input name=&quot;password&quot; type=&quot;password&quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that Django now attempts to catch this problem, as of &lt;a class=&quot;changeset&quot; href=&quot;https://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/3109/&quot;&gt;[3109]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Yourformsdonotuploadfiles&quot;&gt;Your forms do not upload files&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Symptom1&quot;&gt;Symptom&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have &lt;code&gt;FileField()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ImageField()&lt;/code&gt; fields in your form and the files are not uploaded when you submit this form&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Probablecause1&quot;&gt;Probable cause&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be missing the &lt;code&gt;request.FILES&lt;/code&gt; argument when instantiate your &lt;code&gt;Form&lt;/code&gt; object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Solution1&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always make sure that you are passing &lt;code&gt;request.FILES&lt;/code&gt; when intantiate your &lt;code&gt;Form&lt;/code&gt; object:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wiki&quot;&gt;
form = MyForm(request.POST, request.FILES)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Anothercause&quot;&gt;Another cause&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be missing &lt;code&gt;enctype&lt;/code&gt; attribute on your form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Solution2&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you have the &lt;code&gt;enctype&lt;/code&gt; attribute on your form as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wiki&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;form method=&quot;post&quot; action=&quot;/some/url/&quot; enctype=&quot;multipart/form-data&quot;&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;URLconfincludemisbehaving&quot;&gt;URLconf include() misbehaving&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Symptom2&quot;&gt;Symptom&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're trying to get your URLconf files to work, but getting cryptic errors about how there is no module 'index' (where 'index' is some function you are trying to assign as a view), or module 'foo' has no attribute 'urlpatterns'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;77==== Probable cause ====&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have tried to load your view files using include() in the URLconf file (in tutorial 3, this is myproject/settings/urls/main.py). The include() call assumes that the file it's loading is also a URLconf file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Solution3&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remove the include(). Just give the module and function name (e.g., &lt;code&gt;'myproject.apps.polls.views.polls.index'&lt;/code&gt;) as a string, with no include() around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Blankobjectnames&quot;&gt;Blank object names&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Symptom3&quot;&gt;Symptom&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automatic admin interface is showing nothing (or a single &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt;) in the &quot;Select [object_type] to change&quot; view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Probablecause2&quot;&gt;Probable cause&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have forgotten to create a &lt;code&gt;__str__()&lt;/code&gt; function for your model (&lt;code&gt;__unicode__()&lt;/code&gt; in Python 2). Django calls &lt;code&gt;__str__()&lt;/code&gt; to find out how to display objects in the admin interface. An alternate cause is the string you return from &lt;code&gt;__str__()&lt;/code&gt; includes brackets (an therefore looks like an html tag), and is cleaned up by the &lt;code&gt;strip_tags&lt;/code&gt; template filter, resulting in blank entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Solution4&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a correct &lt;code&gt;__str__()&lt;/code&gt; function (without brackets in the output) to all your models. Make it a habit so it becomes automatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;IntegerNULLS&quot;&gt;Integer &amp;amp; NULLS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Problem&quot;&gt;Problem&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have a Field:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wiki-code&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
current_zip &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; meta&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;IntegerField&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;max_length&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; blank&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Django will create a not nullable field in the database. However leaving the field blank (in admin or web interface) Django will try and insert a &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; value in the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Solution5&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;null=True&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wiki-code&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
current_zip &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; meta&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;IntegerField&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;max_length&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; null&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; blank&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;DateNULLS&quot;&gt;Date &amp;amp; NULLS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same problem as Integer &amp;amp; NULLS with the same solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Appendingtoalistinsessiondoesntwork&quot;&gt;Appending to a list in session doesn't work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Problem1&quot;&gt;Problem&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a list in your session, append operations don't get saved to the object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Solution6&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy the list out of the session object, append to it, then copy it back in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wiki&quot;&gt;
sessionlist = request.session['my_list']
sessionlist.append(new_object)
request.session['my_list'] = sessionlist
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, explicitly mark the session as modified:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wiki&quot;&gt;
request.session['my_list'].append(new_object)
request.session.modified = True
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Errorsaboutundefinedattributeswithone-charnames&quot;&gt;Errors about undefined attributes with one-char names&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Problem2&quot;&gt;Problem&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get an AttributeError with some weird attribute name that's only one char long. You don't have that attribute name anywhere in your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Solution7&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search your model and code for situations where you have to pass a tuple of values and want to pass a tuple with one element - and that element is a string like in this sample:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wiki-code&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;META&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;     
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    admin &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; meta&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Admin&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        list_display &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'total_price'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are just missing a comma in the list_display assignment like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wiki-code&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;META&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;     
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    admin &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; meta&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Admin&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        list_display &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'total_price'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, in python:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wiki-code&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;## This causes problems&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;## These are fine.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since a tuple is expected but a string provided, the code will merrily iterate over the characters of the string instead of the tuple elements - and that's where the single-char attribute names come from. If the commas are consistently causing you problems, try using brackets [] instead of parentheses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Imusingformfields.FormWrapperandnoneofmyformfieldsshowup&quot;&gt;I'm using formfields.FormWrapper and none of my form fields show up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Problem3&quot;&gt;Problem&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are using code similar to that documented &lt;a class=&quot;ext-link&quot; href=&quot;http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/forms/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but when you put {{ form.field_name }}, you get nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Solution8&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure when you create your form object, you are passing in empty &lt;strong&gt;dictionaries&lt;/strong&gt;, not tuples. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wiki&quot;&gt;
    manip = things.AddManipulator()
    form = formfields.FormWrapper(manip, {}, {})
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wiki&quot;&gt;
    manip = things.AddManipulator()
    form = formfields.FormWrapper(manip, (), ())
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you pass in empty tuples for data &amp;amp; errors, it will silently fail to insert your form fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;DjangosaysUnabletoOpenDatabaseFilewhenusingSQLite3&quot;&gt;Django says &quot;Unable to Open Database File&quot; when using SQLite3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Problem4&quot;&gt;Problem&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're using SQLite3, your DATABASE_NAME is set to the database file's full path, the database file is writeable by Apache, but you still get the above error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Solution9&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure Apache can also write to the parent directory of the database. SQLite needs to be able to write to this directory. Avoid setting the permissions to 777, as it's a security risk (see &lt;a class=&quot;ext-link&quot; href=&quot;http://askubuntu.com/questions/20105/why-shouldnt-var-www-have-chmod-777&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; for an explanation why).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure each folder of your database file's full path does not start with number, eg. /www/4myweb/db (observed on Windows 2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If DATABASE_NAME is set to something like '/Users/yourname/Sites/mydjangoproject/db/db', make sure you've created the 'db' directory first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure your /tmp directory is world-writable (an unlikely cause as other thing on your system will also not work). &lt;code&gt;ls /tmp -ald&lt;/code&gt; should produce &lt;code&gt;drwxrwxrwt ...&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure the path to the database specified in settings.py is a full path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you working on windows make also sure that you have the path to the db directory written with double backlashes (using os.path methods are recommended)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wiki&quot;&gt;
'C:\\django\\sqlite\\django.db'
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wiki&quot;&gt;
r'C:\django\sqlite\django.db'
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure there is no special charcaters in the path like &quot;éè&quot; or &quot;(&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are using Windows and this message appears intermittently make sure that your security software (Anti-malware) are not opening (and locking) your database file to check for malware presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;Problem5&quot;&gt;Problem&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have no clue how to map a media url to your media directory when using apache2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Solution10&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the &lt;em&gt;Alias&lt;/em&gt; Directive and don't forget to set-up access rights correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wiki&quot;&gt;
Alias /mediaurl /path/to/files
&amp;lt;Directory /path/to/files&amp;gt;
Order allow,deny
Allow from all
&amp;lt;/Directory&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;QuerySetsarentLists&quot;&gt;QuerySets aren't Lists&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Problem6&quot;&gt;Problem&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have been playing with the database API and noticed that a returned query set looks a lot like a list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wiki-code&quot; readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;mysite.polls.models&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Poll&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;Choice
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; Poll&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;objects&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;all&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;Poll&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; What &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; up&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;Poll&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; What &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; your favourite colour&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;## looks a lot like a list to me&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, it doesn't behave like a list in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Solution11&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a couple of cases where the behaviour is not list-like and their solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Python this is how we can test for an empty list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wiki-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't work with a QuerySet. You might try the following but it will fail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wiki-code&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;mysite.polls.models&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Poll&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;Choice
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; p &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Poll&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;objects&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;filter&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;question__startswith&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'ZZZZZZZZZZZZ'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; p
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; p&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way to do it is test for p.exists:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wiki-code&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;mysite.polls.models&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Poll&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;Choice
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; p &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Poll&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;objects&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;filter&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;question__startswith&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'ZZZZZZZZZZZZ'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; p
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; p&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;exists&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another case occurs when you want to retrieve the last member of a QuerySet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wiki-code&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code&quot; readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;mysite.polls.models&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Poll&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;Choice
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; p &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Poll&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;objects&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;all&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; p
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;Poll&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; What &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; up&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;Poll&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; What &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; your favourite colour&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; p&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
Traceback &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;most recent call last&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
  File &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&amp;lt;console&amp;gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; line &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way I get the last member is either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wiki-code&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; p&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;count&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;Poll&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; What &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; your favourite colour&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wiki-code&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; p&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;last&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;Poll&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; What &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; your favourite colour&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Usingreservednameonapplicationbreaksadmin&quot;&gt;Using reserved name on application breaks admin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Symptom4&quot;&gt;Symptom&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After creating a new application, with a model that validates, trying to log on to the admin causes an error similar to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wiki&quot;&gt;
ImproperlyConfigured: Error importing middleware django.middleware.common: &quot;No module named ... &quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Possiblecause&quot;&gt;Possible cause&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check to see that you didn't use a reserved name in naming your application, i.e. &quot;email&quot;, &quot;date&quot; and &quot;time&quot; are common application names that would validate when the server starts but will break Django's admin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Solution12&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rename your application directory using a non-reserved name, i.e., &quot;email_app&quot; instead of &quot;email&quot;. Go into the &lt;code&gt;INSTALLED_APPS&lt;/code&gt; section of settings.py and change the name there too. Also, don't forget to migrate your database (&lt;code&gt;python manage.py migrate&lt;/code&gt;) to create the newly renamed app in your database. You may also want to go in to your database and drop the old &quot;mis-named&quot; table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;unboundmethodcontribute_to_class&quot;&gt;unbound method contribute_to_class()&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Symptom5&quot;&gt;Symptom&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A model does not validate with the following message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wiki&quot;&gt;
Validating models...
project.allication: Error when calling the metaclass bases
    unbound method contribute_to_class() must be called with TextField instance as first argument (got ModelBase instance instead)
1 error found.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;PossibleCause&quot;&gt;Possible Cause&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A model field was not declared properly, the parentheses after the field types name were missing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wrong:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wiki-code&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;models&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Model&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    content &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; models&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;TextField
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;correct:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wiki-code&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;models&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Model&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    content &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; models&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;TextField&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Solution13&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A model field is an &lt;em&gt;instance&lt;/em&gt; of the appropriate &lt;code&gt;Field&lt;/code&gt; class, so the parentheses are required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Permissiondeniedwhenusingstaticserve&quot;&gt;Permission denied when using static serve&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Possiblecause1&quot;&gt;Possible cause&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX is the same as MEDIA_URL in settings.py&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Solution14&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensure they have different values - e.g. ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX = 'admin-media' and MEDIA_URL = '/media'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;DefaultvalueandCallables&quot;&gt;Default value and Callables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Symptom6&quot;&gt;Symptom&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You call a method to set a default value, such as random.randint(), but the value is the same for every new instance of your object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Probablecause3&quot;&gt;Probable cause&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each new instance doesn't call random.randint()&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Solution15&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepend &quot;lambda:&quot; like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wiki-code&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
MyRandNum &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; models&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;CharField&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;max_length&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; default&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;random&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;randint&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;9999&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;PageNotFound&quot;&gt;PageNotFound&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the URLconf defined in wikicamp.urls, Django tried these URL patterns, in this order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wiki&quot;&gt;
    ^wikicamp/(?P&amp;lt;page_name&amp;gt;[^/+])/edit/$
    ^wikicamp/(?P&amp;lt;page_name&amp;gt;[^/+])/save/$
    ^wikicamp/(?P&amp;lt;page_name&amp;gt;[^/+])/$
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current URL, , didn't match any of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Solution16&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;BLANKform&quot;&gt;BLANK form&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be it a normal form , model form or class-based-view The page display a blank (empty) page&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Problem7&quot;&gt;Problem&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possible reason might be you forgot to add {% block content %} {% endblock %} in your template file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Solution17&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure that template used to display the page actually contains the tags {% block content %} {% endblock %} wrapping your form definition in the template file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;TheSECRETKEYsettingmustnotbeempty.&quot;&gt;The SECRET KEY setting must not be empty.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Symptom7&quot;&gt;Symptom&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're attempting to run the Django shell from your terminal (ie. python manage.py shell), for either the first time or after rebooting your system. Instead of a Django shell opening, you are presented with the following error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: The SECRET_KEY setting must not be empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Probablecause4&quot;&gt;Probable cause&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE has not been specified as an environment variable and therefore no settings file could be loaded as the shell attempts to open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Solution18&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable with the appropriate python module in your shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wiki&quot;&gt;
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=&amp;lt;projectname&amp;gt;.settings

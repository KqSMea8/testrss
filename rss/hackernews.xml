<title>A Dark Room: From Sabbatical Year to $800k</title>
<link>https://failory.com/battle-scars</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://failory.com/battle-scars</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;91&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sit back. This is gonna be a long one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did the whole &quot;get a degree, get a job&quot; thing. Ended up being incredibly well paid, but horribly empty because of corporate America. Decided to rage quit, downsize (sell pretty much everything I own), and take a sabbatical. After binge coding on random crap, I partnered with a guy in Canada and ported a web based, incremental, text based game to iOS (A Dark Room iOS). Welp. It went viral and hit the #1 spot. That let me extend my sabbatical for another three years. I built four more games, none of which succeeded. Now I'm back in Corporate America (luckily only part time now... I make enough off my games and other assets to not have to work all year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Long Version:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Frustration:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is such a heavy dose of luck in success. There are those that will give one thousand percent, and because the roll of the dice wasn't perfect, nothing materializes. They have as much love for the game development as I have... they've worked as hard as I have... but just didn't get a kiss from Lady Luck. And it sucks. It just isn't fair that they want to create more than their next breathe, but can't catch a good break to devote time to it. They have to look over at those that have the privaledge to take multiple rolls of the dice, eat their cake and have it too, and if everything still fails, they get bailed out by mommy and daddy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was one of the lucky ones. I saved up for ten years, and was able to role _once_. I hit lucky number eleven. And even then, I still find myself having to grind in a 9 to 5 yet again. Sometimes it's fine. Other times I feel like I should have never taken that sabbatical and remained ignorant of the pure joy that comes from putting yourself in a creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Before Sabbatical:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did what you were supposed to do. Did well (really well) in school. Went to college. Got a degree in Software Engineering and Computer Science. Did internships and landed a job as a developer for an insurance company right out of college. I did that for three years (two years of internships, one year as a full time employee). I then went to work for a company that build veterinary software. Did that for a couple of years. I really really loved coding. Lived and breathed it. I interviewed at a prestigious consulting company and got in on the ground floor. Spent three years there only to be scooped up by another consulting powerhouse. So here I am with a disgusting $140,000 in total compensation. A sea of cubicals, souless sheep that want nothing more than to do their time and go home. I didn't belong cause I actually cared about my craft. I tried to compensate for my unfulfilling corporate work with open source development after hours. This put a toll on my familial relationships (spending 45 hours a week working, then trying to get another 30 hours on nights and weekends, doesn't leave much time for anything else). I was at the brink of collapse. Lose my sanity, my wife, or my job. I decided to get rid of the job. I liquidated my 401k savings (took all the tax penalties up front), and said &quot;alright, gonna live off of this for as long as I can until I figure something out&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;During Sabbatical:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was great to breathe. I was 178 pounds at 5'8 (a little portly). That changed during the sabbatical. It took me three months just to _figure out_ what my routine looked like. I'd code on whatever my heart desired. It was wonderful. I didn't even know what day it was. I didn't miss my stuff. I didn't miss the anxiety attacks I got Sunday nights before having to go to work. All of that gone. By month four I came across the web based version of A Dark Room. I immediately connected with its sparse presentation. I reached out the Michael and asked his permission to port it to mobile. That night I lost track of time. I blinked and it was 3am. I had never felt that kind of loss of time before. Nothing around me existed, it was just me and my creation. After another four months, A Dark Room was done and released to the App Store. It got a whopping thirty downloads the first day. I didn't care. Cause it was my creation and it was awesome. I redesigned so much of the original game. So much of me went into it. Oh and I dropped 30 pounds too. Best shape of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember one of my happiest days. It was early January. I was working on a stupid little multiplayer fighting game written in JavaScript and Pixi.js. I didn't care that ADR was barely getting 10 downloads a day, I didn't care that my savings was dwindling away. I found what I was supposed to do (build digital, evocative experiences).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;171&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Savings Dwindling:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The party was over at this point. My savings was dwindling down. A Dark Room was making its meager two thousand downloads a month (after Apple's cut, taxes, and splits, that's not a lot of take home). I started interviewing again for a job. I was better mentally, physically. And I never want my wife's quality of live to suffer (she was still in college at the time). Being the main bread winner of the home, I knew I had to suck it up and go back to work. I wasn't okay with it, but I knew it was my responsibility. I was interviewing again for those big salaries. I would save as much as possible given my now humble lifestyle. After I had enough cash tucked away, I'd quit and try again. Then. A Dark Room went viral. Out of nowhere it made $800 in one day. Then it made $1,200 in one day. Then it made $5,000. Then it made $8,000. Then it hit the #1 spot and I woke up to a $20,000 sales report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://failory.com/images/Income-Graph.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Dark Room at #1:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Dark Room stayed at the number one spot. I was elated the first day. I was on cloud nine the second day. Then reality reared its ugly face with a sobering message: &quot;this will come to an end.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I waited for it to come to an end. I didn't sleep for 18 days. My life: was hitting the refresh button on the App Store, seeing if I had fallen. I'd do it every 3 hours on the hour, day or night. I did it for eighteen days. I read every review that came through. I'd refresh the page again and see if I had dropped. This was my life. I was waiting for all this success to end. 250,000 downloads later, A Dark Room finally fell from the #1 spot. It was over. From there sales dwindled. After another four months, I was down to 100 downloads a day. I had recouped what I had &quot;spent&quot; taking the sabbatical (and then some). My wife was tired of living in a cramped one bedroom apartment. So, we put a huge down payment on a house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;After A Dark Room Fell:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built a prequel to A Dark Room called The Ensign. It did okay (nowhere near as successful.. but not bad... this was around the time I did my interview with Indie Hackers). I wrote a book about Surviving the App Store too. I put my heart and soul into a game inspired by Edwin Abbot's &quot;Flatland: Romance of Many Dimensions&quot; called A Noble Circle. I created a digital Go board after binge watching Hikaru no Go. I built a touched based mobile RTS called Mildly Interesting RTS (MIRTS for short). Every game had &quot;me&quot; in it. I didn't do ads, I didn't do micro-transactions, scummy energy bars, and all those other bullshit monetization tactics. I ported A Dark Room to Android (which was almost not worth it). I did everything to keep building games. I wrote about all of my journey, presented, did podcasts, hoping to inspire others. And yet revenue kept dwindling. The writing was on the wall. Everything I did after ADR wasn't enough. And I got a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Now:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I am. Updating all my games to work well on iPhone X. Because I love them. I try to build what I can in my free time. But I'm back in Corporate America (it's been ten months so far). Two months in, everything became too real. My journey as a game dev was really over. I got so frustrated. I purged everything online. Took the book down, deleted all of my Reddit entries, my developer logs, my open source games. I removed all of it. All the content I created felt like a lie. Cause even with all this &quot;success&quot;, I couldn't keep my dream going. I felt so much worse off because I got a taste of a fulfilling life that I wish I had been ignorant to. It has been eight months since &quot;The Purge&quot;. I'm _much_ better now. Mostly invisible outside of already established relationships. I stream occasionally on Twitch, keep my games maintained, and work on new ones as time allows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I no longer deal with anxiety attacks Sunday nights at the thought of &quot;clocking in&quot; Monday morning. I'm at peace with it. The people I once called sheep, aren't that. They just didn't have the means to roll the dice. All code I see is beautiful in its own way. It tells a story of the resonable programmers put in unresonable situations. Again, I'm one of the lucky ones. Because maybe in another year, I'll have enough _play money_ saved up to role the dice again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Silver Lining:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My games provide a stable passive income (and I have a _decade_ worth of an emergency funds in the bank). A Dark Room recently hit the #2 spot _overall_ on Google Play (pro tip: stick to iOS, the revenue is almost an order of magnitude better). More importantly, I've very recently acquired the platform that helped me create my labors of love: RubyMotion. So between my games, subscription revenue, and my well paying contract gigs, I do alright for myself. Thank you Lady Luck. And my sincerest, deepest apologies for the 99.9999% that will never see the &quot;failure&quot; I've seen. I really do empathize with you. And I wish I had a better story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Numbers?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure some of you are asking about numbers. Do you remember the title of this post? Do you remember what I said about the 99.9999% failure rate? Do your remember what I said about privaledge, and eating your cake and having it too? What's the point of talking about the numbers I'm making now? So you can dream about one day making these numbers too? You wont. Start with that and work from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you really want numbers, here are some of the numeric sacrifices I made to role the dice _once_:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Have a 4.0 GPA through High School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Graduate #36 out of a class of 800+.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Go to a community college cause it's cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Work two jobs in the summer to pay for college and save up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Go to university in 2001 when it was still possible to pay out of  pocket and graduate without crippling debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Get a degree in something that is valued. Even better if you  actually like what you got a degree in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Land a job right out of school that makes you $55k a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Live off of $15k a year. Don't buy a house. Don't buy a fancy  car. Just save.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Do this for a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Land a job that makes you $100k a year. Save the rest. Max out your 401k contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Celebrate by living off of $30k a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Do this for three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Land a job that makes you $140k a year. Save the rest. Max out your 401k contribution. Get a Roth, put $5k a year into that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Celebrate by living off of $60k a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Do this for three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Don't have kids. Don't get sick. Don't have any catastrophic  events that leave you bankrupt. Probably best to just not leave the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Quit your job. Sell everything. Liquidate your 401k. Pay all the tax  penaties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Live without insurance cause COBRA costs $2000 a month. Still Don't  have kids. Don't get sick. Don't have any catastrophic events that  leave you bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Now you can take a year and a half off and roll the dice _once_. Now  you can read all the success stories online and dream that you'll  get that too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you probably wont. And that's okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Failory Opinion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a sabbatical year, Amir started his own business and stop feeling empty, by finding what he was supposed to do in life. He received a kiss from Lady Luck and achieved success with his app &quot;A Dark Room&quot;. But as we always say, chances of failing are always present. During the last years, they have risen to 90% (Amir ensures this number is even higher, 99.9999%) and succeeding with your startup is the most similar to the roll of a dice. If we spend a second thinking about this, if 9 out of 10 startups fail, then we only need to roll the dice 10 times and the last startup will (by statistics) achieve success. From the previous 9, we will have learned from our mistakes. When smart and hard work meets luck, ventures like &quot;A Dark Room&quot; achieve success.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Power Prices Go Negative in Germany, a Positive for Energy Users</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/25/business/energy-environment/germany-electricity-negative-prices.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/25/business/energy-environment/germany-electricity-negative-prices.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;192&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1391&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;Demand is particularly low on weekends and holidays, when factories are idle and offices empty. The energy supplies that Germany depends on, however, are less predictable than they used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;226&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1617&quot;&gt;Wind power, in particular, is highly dependent on changes in weather patterns. Giant spinning turbines produce, on average, about 12 percent of Germany’s power, but on windy days, they can generate several times that amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;218&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1835&quot;&gt;At the same time, other mainstays of the country’s electricity supply, especially some coal and nuclear power plants, are unable to dial back quickly enough, leading to negative prices on electricity trading markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;story-subheading story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;26&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1861&quot;&gt;Where do they go negative?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;136&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1997&quot;&gt;Several countries in Europe have experienced negative power prices, including Belgium, Britain, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;282&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2279&quot;&gt;But Germany’s forays into negative pricing are the most frequent. At times, Germany is able to export its surplus electricity to its neighbors, helping to balance the market. Still, its experiences of negative prices are often longer, and deeper, than they are in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;200&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2479&quot;&gt;In one recent example, power prices spent 31 hours below zero during the last weekend of October. At one point, they dipped as low as minus €83, or minus $98, per megawatt-hour, a wholesale measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;133&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2612&quot;&gt;In other words, anyone who was able to hook up for a large blast of electricity at that time was paid €83 per unit for the trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;story-ad-2&quot; class=&quot;story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent&quot;&gt;

&lt;a class=&quot;visually-hidden skip-to-text-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/25/business/energy-environment/germany-electricity-negative-prices.html#story-continues-4&quot;&gt;Continue reading the main story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;story-subheading story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;24&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2636&quot;&gt;Why is supply so uneven?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;153&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2789&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;The major drawback of both wind and solar power is that they wax and wane with the breeze and sunshine, and not in response to when they are most needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;294&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3083&quot;&gt;Battery storage capacity, meanwhile, is not yet advanced enough to take in all of the excess generation. And because older power plants that run on fossil fuels take a long time to ramp up and reduce electricity generation, they are not able to respond decisively enough to the shifting supply.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;308&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3391&quot;&gt;Like most traditional power systems, Germany’s was designed to match output to demand. However, “we now have technology that cannot produce according to the demand, but is producing according to the weather,” said Tobias Kurth, the managing director of Energy Brainpool, a Berlin-based consulting firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;114&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3505&quot;&gt;That, he said, is “one of the key challenges in the whole transition of the energy market to renewable power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;story-subheading story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;17&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3522&quot;&gt;What can be done?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;170&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3692&quot;&gt;Negative prices indicate that Germany’s power grid, like most others around the world, has not yet adapted to the increasing amounts of renewable energy being produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;145&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3837&quot;&gt;“We have a lot of stress on the grid,” said Ulrike Hörchens, a spokeswoman for Tennet, a large grid operator in Germany and the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;143&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3980&quot;&gt;For now, technological improvements that would help store additional power, and better distribute it across and between countries, are lagging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;156&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4136&quot;&gt;But regulatory tweaks could make a difference. Germany, for example, does not do enough to encourage customers to increase their use at times of oversupply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;261&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4397&quot;&gt;On a basic level, that could be as simple as providing incentives for people to turn on the washing machine when power is plentiful, and cheap. Companies could make even more use of such guidance, ramping up energy-hungry tasks at times of low-cost electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;story-ad-3&quot; class=&quot;story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent&quot;&gt;

&lt;a class=&quot;visually-hidden skip-to-text-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/25/business/energy-environment/germany-electricity-negative-prices.html#story-continues-5&quot;&gt;Continue reading the main story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;story-subheading story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;55&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4452&quot;&gt;Do German consumers benefit from ‘negative prices’?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;13&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4465&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-5&quot;&gt;Not directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;217&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4682&quot;&gt;The wholesale costs of power make up only about a fifth of the average household electricity bill in Germany. The rest is a stew of taxes, fees to finance renewable-energy investments, and charges for use of the grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;248&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4930&quot;&gt;That means their bills are lower than they otherwise would be, because power prices are sometimes negative, though household energy bills have been rising over all anyway. Basically, utilities are not depositing money in customers’ bank accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;56&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4986&quot;&gt;Power producers are learning to adapt to this new world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;200&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5186&quot;&gt;RWE, one of Germany’s largest operators of power installations, employs a weather forecaster to help anticipate surges in wind power, and to match the spikes to when the company expects peak demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;151&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5337&quot;&gt;While negative prices create problems for the company, they also enhance the value of its more flexible installations, including large storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;224&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5561&quot;&gt;In one case, it takes advantage of negative prices by being paid to pump large volumes of water into a mountain lake in Austria. When prices are higher, the company releases the water, using turbines to generate electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;170&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5731&quot;&gt;“We are able to ramp units down, and switch the pumps on,” said Martin Keiner, RWE’s head of commercial asset optimization. “You can earn a lot on flexibility.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ask HN: Any recommended books on developing mental models?</title>

&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; class=&quot;votelinks&quot;&gt;
&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;default&quot; readability=&quot;20.881135422827&quot;&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;41.250149611011&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Just started going down this rabbit hole myself. I've noticed to really grasp and develop your own mental models you deeply have to understand a few things first:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;1. Human biases: Every mental model is built upon some human bias.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;2. How incentives work: Understanding the motivation behind why people do what they do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;3. Mental thought construction: Understanding how the brain gathers, processes and stores information.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;4. Biology: How we've evolved (and haven't) from stone age times and how that still influences us today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;This is by no means exhaustive but are just some of the topics I've found most useful. That said, here are the best resources I've found:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- The Art Of Thinking Clearly by Rolf Dobelli: Taught me about human biases. Reads like a directory of most biases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- Influence by Robert Cialdini: Taught me about incentives and a whole lot more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- Metaphors We Live By by George Lakoff: Taught me about mental thought construction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- Poor Charlie's Almanack by Charles Munger: Taught me about many things but most importantly good decision making.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- Sapiens by Yuval Harari and his course &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE-kxvSEhkzDEmLQx3RE09aKO4WS-M84t&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE-kxvSEhkzDEmLQx3RE0...&lt;/a&gt;: Taught me about how we've evolved as humans and how we haven't.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman: Taught me more about human biases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- Predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely: Taught me more about how and why we make decisions and what good decisions are.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The thing I've really started to notice is it's not enough to know or read about mental models, you have to ruthlessly apply them. This is tough when even knowing about your biases doesn't stop you from still being affected by them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;athing comtr&quot; id=&quot;16013384&quot; readability=&quot;3.6081632653061&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;default&quot;&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;this is a great list. I would add Hofstadter's Analogy as the fuel and fire of thinking and Chomsky's New horizons in the study of language and mind. they show that language structures are fundamental to consciousness.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The only reason I even recognize many of those items as useful is because I encountered them in university courses. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;His (scarce) podcasts are also very well done. I used to follow a lot of self improvement podcasts and after having listened a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; in the last 5y, it's one of the few that I still follow and consider relevant.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;6.8167539267016&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;How do you distinguish between deconstruction that is accurate vs one that is &quot;useful&quot; but inaccurate?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;It seems rather easy to use deconstruction to see things that aren't really there. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Try probing the system so that it conforms to your model and revise it when new evidence is apparent. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I'm not a philosopher, but I do enjoy reading and learning about post modernism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Isn't a large point of this book that you actually can't confirm a &quot;ground truth&quot;? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;It’s been recommended to death on HN, but &lt;em&gt;Sapiens&lt;/em&gt; is a really interesting look at the development of humans. It uses a lot of philosophy to explain things.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Which &lt;em&gt;Sapiens&lt;/em&gt; exactly do you mean? Is it an article, a book, a documentary movie, a presentation such as a TED talk? Which is the full title?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I suppose you mean the book &quot;Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind&quot; (ISBN 978-0062316097), but I'm honestly not sure if I guessed correctly. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I recommend &quot;The Design of Everyday Things&quot; by Donald A. Norman. It's not necessarily about developing mental models, but more about the fallout of how people can mistakenly use systems if you don't make the mental model of your design intuitive.&lt;/span&gt;

He does an excellent job synthesizing information across fields. I highly recommend it for anybody interested in diving into the field of mental models. It is a book with many citations, so an avid reader will be served well by this book as a launchpad for more learning.&lt;/span&gt;

It also strengthens your ability to imagine things, and hold those images or arrangements in your head, which is useful for applying mental models you've learnt.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Thinking in Systems: A Primer, is a great book that I highly recommend. It's one of those books that serves as a great introduction to the subject of creating models of systems, and it's neither too long, nor overly specific on any particular subject. By the end of it, you'll know roughly enough to be able to know what you want to know next, in regards to system models. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3828902-thinking-in-systems&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3828902-thinking-in-syst...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;12.860215053763&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I've found that mental models -- even very abstract mental models -- are often domain specific, and benefit from domain expertise.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The most general mental models I have seen come from consultants who hop from industry to industry (SWOT for a business, of the BCG matrix) but even they are specific to firms and companies. Broadly speaking, these are often adaptable to any group effort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;There are a lot of books on these mental models or &quot;strategy frameworks&quot; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The most memorable use of the phrase to me is Charlie Munger's &quot;Poor Charlie's Almanack&quot;. If I recall correctly, whenever he makes a big decision, he runs through a checklist of each of his MMs, to see if that way of thinking gives him any insight into the matter at hand. The key thing, though, is that it isn't just limited to human psychology. He supposedly has a great interest in a whole variety of fields. A Renaissance Man. For example, I recall him using thermodynamics as a metaphor for explaining some seemingly-unrelated topic (e.g. business analysis). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full functional WiFi repeater (correctly: a WiFi NAT router)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an implementation of a WiFi NAT router on the esp8266 and esp8285. It can be used as range extender for an existing WiFi network. The esp acts as STA and as soft-AP and transparently forwards any IP traffic through it. As it uses NAT no routing entries are required neither on the network side nor on the connected stations. Stations are configured via DHCP by default in the 192.168.4.0/24 net and receive their DNS responder address from the existing WiFi network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measurements show, that it can achieve about 5 Mbps in both directions, so even streaming is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a setup with multiple routers in a mesh to cover a larger area a new mode &quot;Automesh&quot; has been included &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/martin-ger/esp_wifi_repeater#automesh-mode&quot;&gt;https://github.com/martin-ger/esp_wifi_repeater#automesh-mode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The router also allows for remote monitoring (or packet sniffing), e.g. with Wireshark, port mapping, and ACLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some details are explained in this video: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM2FqnMFCLw&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM2FqnMFCLw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Note on WPA2 enterprise (PEAP)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need a &quot;converter&quot; that translates a WPA2 enterprise network with PEAP authentication into a WPA2-PSK network, have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/martin-ger/esp_peap_psk&quot;&gt;https://github.com/martin-ger/esp_peap_psk&lt;/a&gt; . Was trying to integrate this functionality into this project - however this is difficult, as WPA2 enterprise requires so much free heap during authentication that there is hardly any mem left for anything else. So I decided to leave that in a separate project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Note on WPA2 KRACK security issue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lastest firmware (after 17/Oct/2017) has been build with the patched version of the SDK 2.1.0 from Espressif that mitigates the KRACK (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.krackattacks.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.krackattacks.com/&lt;/a&gt; ) attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The esp_wifi_repeater starts with the following default configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;ap_ssid: MyAP, ap_password: none, ap_on: 1, ap_open: 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;network: 192.168.4.0/24&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;After first boot (or factory reset) it will offer a WiFi network with an open AP and the ssid &quot;MyAP&quot;. It does not yet try to automatically re-connect to an uplink AP (as it does not know a valid ssid or password).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connect to this WiFi network and do the basic configuration either via a simple web interface or the full config with all options via the console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web interface allows for the configuration of all parameters required for the basic forwarding functionality. Thanks to rubfi for the major work on that: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rubfi/esp_wifi_repeater/&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rubfi/esp_wifi_repeater/&lt;/a&gt; . Point your browser to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://192.168.4.1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://192.168.4.1&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. This page should appear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martin-ger/esp_wifi_repeater/master/WebConfig.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martin-ger/esp_wifi_repeater/master/WebConfig.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First enter the appropriate values for the uplink WiFi network, the &quot;STA Settings&quot;, and click &quot;Connect&quot;. The ESP reboots and will connect to your WiFi router. The status LED should be blinking after some seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can reload the page and change the &quot;Soft AP Settings&quot;. Click &quot;Set&quot; and again the ESP reboots. Now it is ready for forwarding traffic over the newly configured Soft AP. Be aware that these changes also affect the config interface, i.e. to do further configuration, connect to the ESP through one of the newly configured WiFi networks. For access through the Soft AP remember the address of the Soft APs network if you have changed that (the ESP has always the adress x.x.x.1 in this network).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like, you can mark the &quot;lock&quot; checkbox and click &quot;Lock&quot;. Now the config cannot be changed anymore without first unlocking it with the uplink WiFi network's password (define one even if the network is open).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you did a mistake and you lost any contact with ESP you can still use the serial console to recover it (&quot;reset facory&quot;, see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advanced configuration has to be done via the command line on the console interface. This console is available either via the serial port at 115200 baud or via tcp port 7777 (e.g. &quot;telnet 192.168.4.1 7777&quot; from a connected STA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the following commands for an initial setup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;set ssid your_home_router's_SSID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set password your_home_router's_password&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set ap_ssid ESP's_ssid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set ap_password ESP's_password&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;show (to check the parameters)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;save&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to enter non-ASCII or special characters on the command line you can use quoting: either use C-style quotes with backslash like this &quot;My\ AccessPoint&quot; or use HTTP-style hex encoding like &quot;My%20AccessPoint&quot;. Both methods will result in a string &quot;My AccessPoint&quot;. With the hex encoding you can enter any byte value you like, except for 0 (for C-internal reasons).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The command line understands a lot more commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic commands (enough to get it working in nearly all environments):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;help: prints a short help message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set [ssid|password] &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt;: changes the settings for the uplink AP (WiFi config of your home-router)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set [ap_ssid|ap_password] &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt;: changes the settings for the soft-AP of the ESP (for your stations)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;show [config|stats]: prints the current config or some status information and statistics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;save [dhcp]: saves the current config parameters [+ the current DHCP leases] to flash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lock [&lt;em&gt;password&lt;/em&gt;]: saves and locks the current config, changes are not allowed. Password can be left open if already set before (Default is the password of the uplink WiFi)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unlock &lt;em&gt;password&lt;/em&gt;: unlocks the config, requires password from the lock command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reset [factory]: resets the esp, 'factory' optionally resets WiFi params to default values (works on a locked device only from serial console)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;quit: terminates a remote session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advanced commands: (Most of the set-commands are effective only after save and reset)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;set automesh [0|1]: selects, whether the automesh mode is on or off (default), see details here &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/martin-ger/esp_wifi_repeater#automesh-mode&quot;&gt;https://github.com/martin-ger/esp_wifi_repeater#automesh-mode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set network &lt;em&gt;ip-addr&lt;/em&gt;: sets the IP address of the internal network, network is always /24, router is always x.x.x.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set dns &lt;em&gt;dns-addr&lt;/em&gt;: sets a static DNS address that is distributed to clients via DHCP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set dns dhcp: configures use of the dynamic DNS address from DHCP, default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set ip &lt;em&gt;ip-addr&lt;/em&gt;: sets a static IP address for the ESP in the uplink network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set ip dhcp: configures dynamic IP address for the ESP in the uplink network, default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set netmask &lt;em&gt;netmask&lt;/em&gt;: sets a static netmask for the uplink network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set gw &lt;em&gt;gw-addr&lt;/em&gt;: sets a static gateway address in the uplink network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set bssid &lt;em&gt;xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx&lt;/em&gt;: sets the specific BSSID of the uplink IP to connect to (default 00:00:00:00:00:00 which means any)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set [ap_mac|sta_mac] &lt;em&gt;xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx&lt;/em&gt;: sets the MAC address of the STA and SOFTAP to a user defined value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scan: does a scan for APs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set ap_on [0|1]: selects, whether the soft-AP is disabled (ap_on=0) or enabled (ap_on=1, default)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set ap_open [0|1]: selects, whether the soft-AP uses WPA2 security (ap_open=0, automatic, if an ap_password is set) or open (ap_open=1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set auto_connect [0|1]: selects, whether the STA should keep retrying to reconnect to the AP. auto_connect is off (0) after first flashing or after &quot;reset factory&quot;. When you enter a new SSID it will be automatically set on (1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set ssid_hidden [0|1]: selects, whether the SSID of the soft-AP is hidden (ssid_hidden=1) or visible (ssid_hidden=0, default)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set phy_mode [1|2|3]: sets the PHY_MODE of the WiFi (1=b, 2=g, 3=n(default))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set speed [80|160]: sets the CPU clock frequency (default 80 Mhz)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set status_led &lt;em&gt;GPIOno&lt;/em&gt;: selects a GPIO pin for the status LED (default 2, &amp;gt;16 disabled)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set [upstream_kbps|downstream_kbps] &lt;em&gt;bitrate&lt;/em&gt;: sets a maximum upstream/downstream bitrate (0 = no limit)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set vmin &lt;em&gt;voltage&lt;/em&gt;: sets the minimum battery voltage in mV. If Vdd drops below, the ESP goes into deep sleep. If 0, nothing happens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set vmin_sleep &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;: sets the time interval in seconds the ESP sleeps on low voltage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set config_port &lt;em&gt;portno&lt;/em&gt;: sets the port number of the console login (default is 7777, 0 disables remote console config)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set web_port &lt;em&gt;portno&lt;/em&gt;: sets the port number of the web config server (default is 80, 0 disables web config)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set config_access &lt;em&gt;mode&lt;/em&gt;: controls the networks that allow config access for console and web (0: no access, 1: only internal, 2: only external, 3: both (default))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;portmap add [TCP|UDP] &lt;em&gt;external_port&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;internal_ip&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;internal_port&lt;/em&gt;: adds a port forwarding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;portmap remove [TCP|UDP] &lt;em&gt;external_port&lt;/em&gt;: deletes a port forwarding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;monitor [on|off|acl] &lt;em&gt;port&lt;/em&gt;: starts and stops monitor server on a given port&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acl [from_sta|to_sta] [TCP|UDP|IP] &lt;em&gt;src-ip&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;em&gt;src_port&lt;/em&gt;] &lt;em&gt;desr-ip&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;em&gt;dest_port&lt;/em&gt;] [allow|deny|allow_monitor|deny_monitor]: adds a new rule to the ACL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acl [from_sta|to_sta] clear: clears the whole ACL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;show acl: shows the defined ACLs and some stats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set acl_debug [0|1]: switches ACL debug output on/off - a denied packets will be logged to the terminal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sleep &lt;em&gt;seconds&lt;/em&gt;: Put ESP into deep sleep for the specified amount of seconds. Valid values between 1 and 4294 (aprox. 71 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In default config GPIO2 is configured to drive a status LED (connected to GND) with the following indications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;permanently on: started, but not successfully connected to the AP (no valid external IP)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;flashing (1 per second): working, connected to the AP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unperiodically flashing: working, traffic in the internal network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &quot;set status_led GPIOno&quot; the GPIO pin can be changed (any value &amp;gt; 16, e.g. &quot;set status_led 255&quot; will disable the status LED completely). When configured to GPIO1, it works with the buildin blue LED on the ESP-01 boards. However, as GPIO1 ist also the UART-TX-pin this means, that the serial console is not working. Configuration is then limited to network access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to allow clients from the external network to connect to server port on the internal network, ports have to be mapped. An external port is mapped to an internal port of a specific internal IP address. Use the &quot;portmap add&quot; command for that. Port mappings can be listed with the &quot;show&quot; command and are saved with the current config.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, to make sure that the expected device is listening at a certain IP address, it has to be ensured the this devices has the same IP address once it or the ESP is rebooted. To achive this, either fixed IP adresses can be configured in the devices or the ESP has to remember its DHCP leases. This can be achived with the &quot;save dhcp&quot; command. It saves the current state and all DHCP leases, so that they will be restored after reboot. DHCP leases can be listed with the &quot;show stats&quot; command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you might want to use several esp_wifi_repeaters in a row or a mesh to cover a larger distance or area. Generally, this can be done without any problems with NAT routers, actually you will have several layers of NAT. Of course, the available bandwidth goes down the more hops you need. But users have reported that even 5 esp_wifi_repeaters in a row work quite well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In such a setup configuration is quite a time consuming and error-prone activity. To simplify that, the esp_wifi_repeater now has a new mode: &quot;Automesh&quot;. Just configure the SSID and the password and switch &quot;automesh&quot; on. (either on the CLI with &quot;set automesh 1&quot; or on the Web interface with just select the checkbox). This will do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each esp_wifi_repeater configured in that way will automatically offer a WiFi network on the AP with the same SSID/password as it is connected to. Clients can use the same WiFi settings for the original network or the repeated ones. Each esp_wifi_repeater configured with &quot;automesh&quot; will first search for the best other AP to connect to. This is the one which is closest to the original WiFi network and has the best signal strength (RSSI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signal strenght is easy to measure with a scan, but which is the one closest to the original WiFi network when you see several APs with the same SSID? Therefore the protocol use a somewhat dirty trick: the esp_wifi_repeaters in &quot;automesh&quot; mode manipulate their BSSID, i.e. the MAC address of their AP interface, which is send out with every beacon frame 10 about time times per second. It uses the format: 24:24:mm:rr:rr:rr. &quot;24:24&quot; is just the unique identifier of a repeater (there is a minimal probability that this collides with the real APs MAC, but we can neglect this, as we can change that prefix if really required). &quot;mm&quot; means the &quot;mesh level&quot;, this is the distance in hops to the original WiFi network. The last three &quot;rr:rr:rr&quot; are just random numbers to distinguish the various ESPs. The original AP keeps its BSSID, i.e. the one without the prefix &quot;24:24&quot; is recognized as root, called mesh level 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martin-ger/esp_wifi_repeater/master/AutoMesh.JPG&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martin-ger/esp_wifi_repeater/master/AutoMesh.JPG&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now each esp_wifi_repeater can learn which other esp_wifi_repeater is the closest to the the original WiFi network, can connect to that, and chose its own BSSID accordingly. Also the IP address of the internal network is adjusted to the mesh level: 10.24.m.0. This creates a tree (a very special mesh) with the original WiFi AP as root and repeating nodes on several mesh levels (actually, it works somewhat similar as the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) on the link layer or routing on the network layer using a Distance Vector protocol). As soon as an uplink link loss is detected, configuration is restarted. This should avoid loops, as during (re-)configuration also no beacons with an BSSID are sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For convenience, the esp_wifi_repeater after &quot;automesh&quot; configuration first tries to check, whether it can connect to an uplink AP. If this fails, even when an AP with the correct SSID has been found, it assumes, the user did a mistake with the password and resets to factory defaults. After it had connected successfully once, it will assume config is correct and keep on trying after connection loss or reset as long as it takes (to avoid a DOS attack with a misconfigured AP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the console a monitor service can be started (&quot;monitor on [portno]&quot;). This service mirrors the traffic of the internal network in pcap format to a TCP stream. E.g. with a &quot;netcat [external_ip_of_the_repeater] [portno] | sudo wireshark -k -S -i -&quot; from an computer in the external network you can now observe the traffic in the internal network in real time. Use this e.g. to observe with which internet sites your internals clients are communicating. Be aware that this at least doubles the load on the esp and the WiFi network. Under heavy load this might result in some packets beeing cut short or even dropped in the monitor session. CAUTION: leaving this port open is a potential security issue. Anybody from the local networks can connect and observe your traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ESP router has a integrated basic firewall. ACLs (Access Control Lists) can be applied to the SoftAP interface. This is a cornerstone in IoT security, when the router is used to bring other IoT devices into the internet. It can be used to prevent e.g. third-party IoT devices from &quot;calling home&quot;, being misused as malware bots, and to protect your home network with PCs, tablets and phones from being visible to home automation devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two ACL lists are named &quot;from_sta&quot; and &quot;to_sta&quot; for incoming and outgoing packets. ACLs are defined in &quot;CISCO IOS style&quot;. The following example will allow for outgoing local broadcasts (for DHCP), UDP 53 (DNS), and TCP 1883 (MQTT) to a local broker, any other packets will be blocked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;acl from_sta clear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acl from_sta IP any 255.255.255.255 allow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acl from_sta UDP any any any 53 allow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acl from_sta TCP any any 192.168.0.0/16 1883 allow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acl from_sta IP any any deny&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACLs for the &quot;to_sta&quot; direction may be defined as well, but this is usually not required, as the reverse direction is quite well protected against unsolicited traffic by the NAT transation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACLs consist of filtering rules that are processed for each packet. Each rule consists of a protocol (IP, TCP, or UDP), source address/port, destination address/port, as well as an action &quot;allow&quot; or &quot;deny&quot;. In case of plain IP no ports, only addresses are given. IP rules include TCP and UDP packets. Addresses can be given as subnet addresses in the &quot;/&quot; notation, e.g. 192.168.178.0/24. Also &quot;any&quot; can be used as wildcard, it matches on any address or portnumber. A rule is defined by the &quot;acl&quot; command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;acl [from_sta|to_sta] [TCP|UDP|IP] &lt;em&gt;src-ip&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;em&gt;src_port&lt;/em&gt;] &lt;em&gt;desr-ip&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;em&gt;dest_port&lt;/em&gt;] [allow|deny|allow_monitor|deny_monitor]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rules are processed top-down in the order of their appearance in the list. The first rule that matches a packet is applied and determies whether a packet is allowed (and forwarded) or denied (and dropped). This means, special cases first, general rules at the end. If there are rules in an ACL all packets that don't match any rule are denied by default. Thus, the last rule &quot;from_sta IP any any deny&quot; in the example above is not really needed, as it is the default anyway. If an ACL is empty, all packets are allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definition of ACL rules works also top-down: a new rule is always added at the end of a list. To change an ACL you first have to clear it completely (acl from_sta clear) and then rebuild it. ACLs are saved with the config. &quot;show acl&quot; will print out the ACLs plus statistics on the number of hits for each rule and the overall number of allowed and denied packets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the command &quot;set acl_debug 1&quot; a summary of all denied packets is printed to the console. Also, an MQTT topic can publishe this summary. This can be used for firewall configuration to determine which rules are required to get the connected devices working. It also gives a hint if, if unexpected traffic happens (and is denied).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For deeper analysis the monitoring service can be used (even denied packets are reported to the monitor before they are dropped). When the monitor is started with the &quot;monitor acl &lt;em&gt;port&lt;/em&gt;&quot; command, ACLs can be used as online filters. All rules that are defined as &quot;allow_monitor&quot; instead of &quot;allow&quot; and &quot;deny_monitor&quot; instead of &quot;deny&quot; are processed as usual, resulting in allowing of forwarding a packet, but they also send the packet to the monitor. Thus a list of rules that basically &quot;allow&quot; or &quot;allow_monitor&quot; all packets still makes sense, as it can be used to select already during catpure time which packet should be recorded. E.g. a lists:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;acl from_sta clear&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;acl from_sta IP 192.168.0.0/16 any allow_monitor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;acl from_sta IP any any allow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;acl to_sta clear&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;acl to_sta IP any 192.168.0.0/16 allow_monitor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;acl to_sta IP any any allow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;will allow all packets and also select all packets for monitoring that go from a station to the 192.168.0.0/16 (local)subnet and from the 192.168.0.0/16 to a station. Of course such a filter can be applied also after the capture to a full monitoring trace, but if you already know, what you are looking for, these online filters will help to reduce monitoring overhead drastically. It can also be used to debug all deny firewall rules by simply using &quot;deny_monitor&quot; instead of deny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By setting upstream_kbps and downstream_kbps to a value != 0 (0 is the default), you can limit the maximum bitrate of the ESP's AP. This value is a limit that applies to the traffic of all connected clients. Packets that would exeed the defined bitrate are dropped. The traffic shaper uses the &quot;Token Bucket&quot; algorithm with a bucket size of currently four times the bitrate per seconds, allowing for bursts, when there was no traffic before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since version 1.3 the router has a build-in MQTT client (thanks to Tuan PM for his library &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tuanpmt/esp_mqtt&quot;&gt;https://github.com/tuanpmt/esp_mqtt&lt;/a&gt;). This can help to integrate the router/repeater into the IoT. A home automation system can e.g. make decisions based on infos about the currently associated stations, it can switch on and of the repeaters (e.g. based on a time schedule), or it can simply be used to monitor the load. The router can be connected either to a local MQTT broker or to a publically available broker in the cloud. However, currently it does not support TLS encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default the MQTT client is disabled. It can be enabled by setting the config parameter &quot;mqtt_host&quot; to a hostname different from &quot;none&quot;. To configure MQTT you can set the following parameters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;set mqtt_host &lt;em&gt;IP_or_hostname&lt;/em&gt;: IP or hostname of the MQTT broker (&quot;none&quot; disables the MQTT client)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set mqtt_port &lt;em&gt;port&lt;/em&gt;: Port of the MQTT broker used for connection (default: 1883)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set mqtt_user &lt;em&gt;username&lt;/em&gt;: Username for authentication (&quot;none&quot; if no authentication is required at the broker)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set mqtt_user &lt;em&gt;password&lt;/em&gt;: Password for authentication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set mqtt_id &lt;em&gt;clientId&lt;/em&gt;: Id of the client at the broker (default: &quot;ESPRouter_xxxxxx&quot; derived from the MAC address)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set mqtt_prefix &lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;: Prefix for all published topics (default: &quot;/WiFi/ESPRouter_xxxxxx/system&quot;, again derived from the MAC address)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set mqtt_command_topic &lt;em&gt;command_topic&lt;/em&gt;: Topic subscribed to receive commands, same as from the console. (default: &quot;/WiFi/ESPRouter_xxxxxx/command&quot;, &quot;none&quot; disables commands via MQTT)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set mqtt_interval &lt;em&gt;secs&lt;/em&gt;: Set the interval in which the router publishs status topics (default: 15s, 0 disables status publication)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set mqtt_mask &lt;em&gt;mask_in_hex&lt;/em&gt;: Selects which topics are published (default: &quot;ffff&quot; means all)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MQTT parameters can be displayed with the &quot;show mqtt&quot; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The router can publish the following status topics periodically (every mqtt_interval):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;/Uptime: System uptime since last reset in s (mask: 0x0020)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;/Vdd: Voltage of the power supply in mV (mask: 0x0040)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;/Bpsin: Bytes/s from stations into the AP (mask: 0x0800)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;/Bpsout: Bytes/s from the AP to stations (mask: 0x1000)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;/Ppsin: Packets/s from stations into the AP (mask: 0x0200)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;/Ppsout: Packets/s from the AP to stations (mask: 0x0400)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;/Bin: Total bytes from stations into the AP (mask: 0x0100)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;/Bout: Total bytes from the AP to stations (mask: 0x0100)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;/NoStations: Number of stations currently connected to the AP (mask: 0x2000)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition it can publish on an event basis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;/join: MAC address of a station joining the AP (mask: 0x0008)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;/leave: MAC address of a station leaving the AP (mask: 0x0010)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;/IP: IP address of the router when received via DHCP (mask: 0x0002)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;/ScanResult: Separate topic for the results of a &quot;scan&quot; command (one message per found AP) (mask: 0x0004)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;/ACLDeny: A packet has been denied by an ACL rule and has been dropped (mask: 0x0080)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The router can be configured using the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;command_topic&lt;/em&gt;: The router subscribes on this topic and interprets all messages as command lines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;/response: The router publishes on this topic the command line output (mask: 0x0001)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you now want the router to publish e.g. only Vdd, its IP, and the command line output, set the mqtt_mask to 0x0001 | 0x0002 | 0x0040 (= &quot;set mqtt_mask 0043&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The repeater monitors its current supply voltage (shown in the &quot;show stats&quot; command). If &lt;em&gt;vmin&lt;/em&gt; (in mV, default 0) is set to a value &amp;gt; 0 and the supply voltage drops below this value, it will go into deep sleep mode for &lt;em&gt;vmin_sleep&lt;/em&gt; seconds. If you have connected GPIO16 to RST (which is hard to solder on an ESP-01) it will reboot after this interval, try to reconnect, and will continue its measurements. If &lt;em&gt;vmin&lt;/em&gt; is saved with the config, it will sleep over and over again, until the supply voltage raises above the threshold. These settings are especially (only?) useful if you have powered the ESP with a (lithium) battery whithout undercharge protection. Then a value of 2900mV-3000mV is probably helpful, as it reduces power consumption of the ESP to a minimum and you have much more time to recharge or replace the battery before damage. This only makes sense, if you have the ESP connected directly to the battery. If you have additional logic, this will still drain the battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can send the ESP to sleep manually once by using the &quot;sleep&quot; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caution: If you save a &lt;em&gt;vmin&lt;/em&gt; value higher than the max supply voltage to flash, the repeater will immediatly shutdown every time after reboot. Then you have to wipe out the whole config by flashing blank.bin (or any other file) to 0x0c000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build this binary you download and install the esp-open-sdk (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pfalcon/esp-open-sdk&quot;&gt;https://github.com/pfalcon/esp-open-sdk&lt;/a&gt;). Make sure, you can compile and download the included &quot;blinky&quot; example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then download this source tree in a separate directory and adjust the BUILD_AREA variable in the Makefile and any desired options in user/user_config.h. Build the esp_wifi_repeater firmware with &quot;make&quot;. &quot;make flash&quot; flashes it onto an esp8266.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source tree includes a binary version of the liblwip_open plus the required additional includes from my fork of esp-open-lwip. &lt;em&gt;No additional install action is required for that.&lt;/em&gt; Only if you don't want to use the precompiled library, checkout the sources from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/martin-ger/esp-open-lwip&quot;&gt;https://github.com/martin-ger/esp-open-lwip&lt;/a&gt; . Use it to replace the directory &quot;esp-open-lwip&quot; in the esp-open-sdk tree. &quot;make clean&quot; in the esp_open_lwip dir and once again a &quot;make&quot; in the upper esp_open_sdk directory. This will compile a liblwip_open.a that contains the NAT-features. Replace liblwip_open_napt.a with that binary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to use the complete precompiled firmware binaries you can flash them with &quot;esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 write_flash -fs 32MB 0x00000 firmware/0x00000.bin 0x10000 firmware/0x10000.bin&quot; (use -fs 8MB for an ESP-01). For the esp8285 you must use -fs 1MB and -fm dout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Windows you can flash it using the &quot;ESP8266 Download Tool&quot; available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools&lt;/a&gt;. Download the two files 0x00000.bin and 0x10000.bin from the firmware directory. For a generic ESP12, a NodeMCU or a Wemos D1 use the following settings (for an ESP-01 change FLASH SIZE to &quot;8Mbit&quot;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martin-ger/esp_wifi_repeater/master/FlashRepeaterWindows.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martin-ger/esp_wifi_repeater/master/FlashRepeaterWindows.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &quot;QIO&quot; mode fails on your device, try &quot;DIO&quot; instead. Also have a look at the &quot;Detected Info&quot; to check size and mode of the flash chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, especially on old ESP-01s, there is a wrong or non-matching version of &quot;esp_init_data_default.bin&quot; in the flash. If the firmware files from above flash correctly but after reboot you see only garbage on the serial and/or the LED on GPIO2 is flashing rapidly, try to re-initialize this sector: download &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/espressif/ESP8266_NONOS_SDK/blob/master/bin/esp_init_data_default.bin?raw=true&quot;&gt;https://github.com/espressif/ESP8266_NONOS_SDK/blob/master/bin/esp_init_data_default.bin?raw=true&lt;/a&gt; and flash it to 0x7c000 for 512 kB modules (some ESP-01, Sonoff Switch), 0xfc000 for 1 MB modules (most ESP-01), or 0x3fc000 for 4 MB modules (most ESP-12, Wemos D1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your downloaded firmware still doesn't start properly, please check with the enclosed checksums whether the binary files are possibly corrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Due to the limitations of the ESP's SoftAP implementation, there is a maximum of 8 simultaniously connected stations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuration via TCP (write_flash) requires a good power supply. Try to check this, if you ESP runs unstable. A large capacitor between Vdd and Gnd can help if you experience problems here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/article&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Many potential emergency room patients are too sick to drive themselves to a hospital. But an ambulance can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars without insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This where a popular ride-sharing app can step in, while also freeing up the ambulances for those who need them most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With demand for ambulances decreased by available Uber drivers, emergency personnel have been able reach critical patients faster while also applying necessary treatment on the way to the hospital, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.ku.edu/~kuwpaper/2017Papers/201708.pdf&quot;&gt;a new economic study&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Kansas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Given that even a reduction of a few minutes can drastically improve survival rates for serious conditions, this could be associated with a substantial welfare improvement.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study investigated ambulance rates in 766 U.S. cities from 43 different states. Taking into account the timelines of when Uber entered each city, the researchers found that the app reduced per capita ambulance usage rates by around 7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In order to lower health care spending while improving health outcomes, people can use the least-skilled professional who is still qualified,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ku.edu/2017/12/08/uber-reduces-ambulance-usage-major-cities-economists-find&quot;&gt;said the paper's author, University of Kansas economist David Slusky&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;It's the same in the provider space: you don't need a neurosurgeon to diagnose strep throat.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Syed and Lisa K. Sharp&lt;/a&gt;, doctors at the Kalamazoo College, suggests that cost-efficient access to a vehicle is consistently associated with increased access to health care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We want to find every way possible,&quot; Slusky said, &quot;to bend the medical cost curve.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Quiet</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/24/quiet/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/24/quiet/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;first&quot;&gt;T&lt;/p&gt;
he trip began just before the end of school. From the wood-shaving smell of third grade out into the clean winter air, sprung free by my mother who appeared at the little window in the classroom door like a treat. You were the one who got out early. You were the one walking down an empty hall toward the big triple doors of the school.
&lt;p&gt;We were leaving school to drive to my grandmother’s house. These were the days before everything: Before we could Skype home and feel we’d done something meaningful. Before entertainment and education and music on-demand. Before the world clattered at us like a garish streetcar, wheels screeching, bells ringing, doors open and waiting to take us away from the present and into an unknown future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the street was a little mall, Sharon Square, cut through by something they called an Arcade by its builders. The name endlessly disappointed me – there were no video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“An arcade is a covered walkway,” my dad told me, but that didn’t make sense. We walked through the arcade – the passage between a music shop and a liquor store. It was a drab place, dark and concrete, and we came out onto the parking lot facing High Street — Columbus’s main artery — and crossed the street to wait for the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The escape was almost too much. I was buzzing. The rest of the kids were inside and my sister and I were free, out an hour early on a Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bus came a moment later. I didn’t wear a watch, but it seemed to come always, hissing outside our classroom window in the summer, flashing past when the windows were closed. It came now for us, this strange bulbous thing, clad in COTA red and blue or, if we were lucky, one of the older tan models. We sat on the seats up front, the heater burbling, the bus nearly empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1:30. Escaped. The school diminished in the distance, disappeared. The spire of St.Michael’s fell away as new buildings popped up. The Graceland Theatre. The computer shop across the street. White Castle. These places I wanted to visit but we had no time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father was waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the side-lit streets we rode, heat coming out from under the fake leather seats, a smell of oil and polish and snow. I’d press my cheek against the bus window glass and feel the cold quarters of an inch away but in here it was warm and calm. People would hop on and off but the bus was mostly empty. It was early on December 23rd, and Columbus was a sleepy town especially around the holidays. This bus was our own. It dinged stops along High Street and we got off just before E. Broad Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;writerquote-wrap center pullquote-center&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;writerquote&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is up to all of us to keep that safe, strange feeling of disconnection and the invincible pleasure of just being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Columbus’s heart, its downtown. In the distance the State House, up the street a creche at the Nationwide Building. Where the bus stopped was a fireproof storage building, a sign in gold leaf crackling on the glass. Here it was busier with cars rushing past us as we ran to the next bus. Older sedans rolled by on studded snow tires, but there had been no snow for a few days. The wet hissing was familiar to me – my father drove on studs most of the winter – and it made me think of a waterfall we had seen that summer, a dull roar over rocks, water cascading into a deep pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We boarded the Broad Street bus for the final leg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirty minutes later, past the regal boys’ and girls’ schools, past low buildings that dropped away into bigger shopping centers with wide parking lots, past the mysterious &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.critiki.com/location/kahiki-supper-club-columbus-33/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Kahiki&lt;/a&gt; — the strange red, white, and black boat-shaped building — up to the shopping center across from DCSC, the massive set of warehouses at the edge of town where my father did inexplicable things related, he said, to Army Jeep parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was waiting for us in his car, an old brown Mercury Zephyr. The car was warm and the trunk was packed full of presents and clothes. I had a backpack full of books and we started off on our three-hour drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pulled the first book out of my bag before we hit the highway. All Things Considered’s sing song horn intro began as we began the slow roll up through the farms surrounding Columbus. My sister and I nestled into the depths of the back seat, bunched up against another spare front car seat my father had wedged in behind his own broken seat to keep himself from sliding backwards. We didn’t have much room but we were warm and close and sleepy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It got darker as we drove and I had to put my book down. The hiss of the tires on the asphalt lulled us and there was nothing backlit to keep us up. I’d close my eyes for a moment and then wake again and look out at the edge of the world, hills rising up as we entered the edge of the Alleghenies, the moon low on the horizon, bouncing like a ball when I moved my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hours passed as one radio station ran to static and another picked up in the country dark, high radio towers winking somewhere in a town far from the highway, talk radio turning into country into oldies into classical. We didn’t have a tape player in the car and so we were at the mercy of whatever radio fizzed through the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d be wakened by the car slowing and the radio turning down. We were near Martins Ferry, close to my grandmother’s house, in a place called Cambridge (which, in my young mind, was a bridge made of canes). Sometimes we’d stop for gas before rolling north along the river, the dark of the back seat cut through by the glare of harsh gas station fluorescents. This time we kept driving, up the river, past the high hills where my father once played as a boy, to the little street that turned down a smaller street to where my grandmother lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is her kitchen light, a salve against the cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These long-ago memories aren’t important to you as they are me but it helps us remember just what we all have and what we’re all missing. I’m reminded of the work of Patrick Leigh Fermor who walked from England to Istanbul before World War II at a time when there was little of the webbing that knits us together. He traveled in a vacuum, existing in a giddy collection of moments unavailable to our always-on minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I lay in one of those protracted moments of rapture which scatter this journey like asterisks,” he wrote. “A little more, I felt, and I would have gone up like a rocket.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every one of us has these memories, and it is up to all of us to keep that safe, strange feeling of disconnection and the invincible pleasure of just being. We owe it to ourselves and the future. It, like my grandmother’s kitchen light, like the Moon over the hills, like the hiss of tires on an old road, is salve against the cruelty and confusion of a world that does not wish to let us be.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to Write Articles and Essays Quickly and Expertly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;byline&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;By Stephen Downes&lt;br/&gt;Sept 13, 2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Translations:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://webhostinggeeks.com/science/how-to-write-articles-and-essays-be&quot;&gt;Belorussian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Introduction: Four Types of Discursive Writing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From time to time people express amazement at how I can get so much done. I, of course, aware of the many hours I have idled away doing nothing, demur. It feels like nothing special; I don't work harder, really, than most people. Nonetheless, these people do have a point. I am, in fact, a fairly prolific writer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of it is tenacity. For example, I am writing this item as I wait for the internet to start working again in the Joburg airport departures area. But part of it is a simple strategy for writing your essays and articles quickly and expertly, a strategy that allows you to plan your entire essay as you write it, and thus to allow you to make your first draft your final draft. This article describes that strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Begin by writing - in your head, at least - your second paragraph (that would be the one you just read, above). Your second paragraph will tell people what your essay says. Some people write abstracts or executive summaries in order to accomplish this task. But you don't need to do this. You are stating your entire essay or article in one paragraph. If you were writing a news article, you would call this paragraph the 'lede'. A person could read just the one paragraph and know what you had to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how do you write this paragraph? Reporters will tell you that writing the lede is the hardest part of writing an article. Because if you don't know what the story is, you cannot write it in a single paragraph. A reporter will sift through the different ways of writing the story - the different angles - and find a way to tell it. You, because you are writing an article or essay, have more options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have more options because there are four types of discursive writing. Each of these types has a distinct and easy structure, and once you know what sort of writing you are doing, the rest of the article almost writes itself. The four types of structure are: argument, explanation, definition, and description. So, as you think about writing your first paragraph, ask yourself, what sort of article are you writing. In this article, for example, I am writing a descriptive article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are your choices of types of article or essay:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Argument&lt;/span&gt;: convinces someone of something&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Explanation&lt;/span&gt;: tells why something happened instead of something else&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Definition&lt;/span&gt;: states what a word or concept means&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Description&lt;/span&gt;: identifies properties or qualities of things&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;span&gt;argument&lt;/span&gt; is a collection of sentences (known formally as 'propositions') intended to convince the reader that something is he case. Perhaps you want to convince people to take some action, to buy some product, to vote a certain way, or to believe a certain thing. The thing that you want to convince them to believe is the conclusion. In order to convince people, you need to offer one or more reasons. Those are the premises. So one type of article consists of premises leading to a conclusion, and that is how you would structure your first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;span&gt;explanation&lt;/span&gt; tells the reader why something is the case. It looks at some event or phenomenon, and shows the reader what sort of things led up to that event or phenomenon, what caused it to happen, why it came to be this way instead of some other way. An explanation, therefore, consists of three parts. First, you need to identify the thing being explained. Then, you need to identify the things that could have happened instead. And finally, you need to describe the conditions and principles that led to the one thing, and not the other, being the case. And so, if you are explaining something, this is how you would write your first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;span&gt;definition&lt;/span&gt; identifies the meaning of some word, phrase or concept. There are different ways to define something. You can define something using words and concepts you already know. Or you can define something by giving a name to something you can point to or describe. Or you can define something indirectly, by giving examples of telling stories. A definition always involves two parts: the word or concept being defined, and the set of sentences (or 'propositions') that do the defining. Whatever way you decide, this will be the structure of your article if you intend to define something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, a &lt;span&gt;description&lt;/span&gt; provides information about some object, person, or state of affairs. It will consist of a series of related sentences. The sentences will each identify the object being defined, and then ascribe some property to that object. &quot;The ball is red,&quot; for example, were the ball is the object and 'red' is the property. Descriptions may be of 'unary properties' - like colour, shape, taste, and the like, or it may describe a relation between the object and one or more other objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Organizing Your Writing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The set of sentences, meanwhile, will be organized on one of a few common ways. The sentences might be in &lt;span&gt;chronological&lt;/span&gt; order. &quot;This happened, and then this happened,&quot; and so on. Or they may enumerate a &lt;span&gt;set of properties&lt;/span&gt; ('appearance', 'sound', 'taste', 'small', 'feeling about', and the like). Or they may be &lt;span&gt;elements of a list&lt;/span&gt; (&quot;nine rules for good technology,&quot; say, or &quot;ten things you should learn&quot;). Or, like the reporters, you may cover &lt;span&gt;the five W's&lt;/span&gt;: who, what, where, when, why. Or the steps required to write an essay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you elect to write an essay or article, then, you are going to write one of these types of writing. If you cannot decide which type, then your purpose isn't clear. Think about it, and make the choice, before continuing. Then you will know the major parts of the article - the premises, say, or the parts of the definition. Again, if you don't know these, your purpose isn't clear. Know what you want to say (in two or three sentences) before you decide to write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may a this point be wondering what happened to the first paragraph. You are, after all, beginning with the second paragraph. The first paragraph is used to 'animate' your essay or article, to give it life and meaning and context. In my own writing, my animation is often a short story about myself showing how the topic is important to me. Animating paragraphs may express feelings - joy, happiness, sadness, or whatever. They may consist of short stories or examples of what you are trying to describe (this is very common in news articles). Animation may be placed into your essay at any point. But is generally most effective when introducing a topic, or when concluding a topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, I have now concluded the first paragraph of my essay, and then expanded on it, thus ending the first major part of my essay. So now I could offer an example here, to illustrate my point in practice, and to give the reader a chance to reflect, and a way to experience some empathy, before proceeding. This is also a good place to offer a picture, diagram, illustration or chart of what you are trying to say in words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like this: the second paragraph sill consist of a set of statements. Here is what each of the four types look like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Argument:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Premise 1&lt;br/&gt;Premise 2 ... (and more, if needed)&lt;br/&gt;Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explanation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thing being explained&lt;br/&gt;Alternative possibilities&lt;br/&gt;Actual explanation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Definition:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thing being defined&lt;br/&gt;Actual definition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thing being described&lt;br/&gt;Descriptive sentence&lt;br/&gt;Descriptive sentence (and more, connected to the rest, as needed)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So now the example should have made the concept clearer. You should easily see that your second paragraph will consist of two or more distinct sentences, depending on what you are trying to say. Now, all you need to do is to write the sentences. But also, you need to tell your reader which sentence is which. In an argument, for example, you need to clearly indicate to the reader which sentence is your conclusion and which sentences are your premises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Indicator Words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All four types of writing have their own indicator words. Let's look at each of the four types in more detail, and show (with examples, to animate!) the indicator words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As stated above, an argument will consist of a conclusion and some premises. The conclusion is the most important sentence, and so will typically be stated first. For example, &quot;Blue is better than red.&quot; Then a premise indicator will be used, to tell the reader that what follows is a series of premises. Words like 'because' and 'since' are common premise indicators (there are more; you may want to make a list). So your first paragraph might look like this: &quot;Blue is better than red, &lt;span&gt;because&lt;/span&gt; blue is darker than red, and all colours that are darker are better.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when the premises need to be stressed before the conclusion will be believed, the author will put the conclusion at the end of the paragraph. To do this, the author uses a conclusion indicator. Words like 'so' and 'therefore' and 'hence' are common conclusion indicators. Thus, for example, the paragraph might read: &quot;Blue is darker than red, and all colours that are darker are better, &lt;span&gt;so&lt;/span&gt; blue is better than red.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should notice that indicator words like this help you understand someone else's writing more easily as well. Being able to spot the premises and the conclusion helps you spot the structure of their article or essay. Seeing the conclusion indicator, for example, tells you that you are looking at an argument, and helps you spot the conclusion. It is good practice to try spotting arguments in other writing, and to create arguments of your own, in our own writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Arguments&lt;/span&gt; can also be identified by their form. There are different types of argument, which follow standard patterns of reasoning. These patterns of reasoning are indicated by the words being used. Here is a quick guide to the types of arguments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Inductive argument&lt;/span&gt;: the premise consists of a 'sample', such as a series of experiences, or experimental results, or polls. Watch for words describing these sorts of observation. The conclusion will be inferred as a generalization from these premises. Watch for words that indicate a statistical generalization, such as 'most', 'generally, 'usually', 'seventy percent', 'nine out of ten'. Also, watch for words that indicate a universal generalization, such as 'always' and 'all'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A special case of the inductive argument is the &lt;span&gt;causal generalization&lt;/span&gt;. If you want someone to believe that one thing causes another, then you need to show that there are many cases where the one thing was followed by the other, and also to show that when the one thing didn't happen, then the other didn't either. This establishes a 'correlation'. The argument becomes a causal argument when you appeal to some general principle or law of nature to explain the correlation. Notice how, in this case, an explanation forms one of the premises of the argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Deductive argument&lt;/span&gt;: the premises consist of propositions, and the conclusion consists of some logical manipulation of the premises. A &lt;span&gt;categorical&lt;/span&gt; argument, for example, consists of reasoning about sets of things, so watch for words like 'all', 'some' and 'none'. Many times, these words are implicit; they are not started, but they are implied. When I said &quot;Blue is better than red&quot; above, for example, I meant that &quot;blue is always better than red,&quot; and that's how you would have understood it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another type of deductive argument is a &lt;span&gt;propositional&lt;/span&gt; argument. Propositional arguments are manipulations of sentences using the words 'or', 'if', and 'and'. For example, if I said &quot;Either red is best or blue is best, and red is not best, so blue is best,&quot; then I have employed a propositional argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is useful to learn the basic argument forms, so you can very clearly indicate which type of argument you are providing. This will make your writing clearer to the reader, and will help them evaluate your writing. And in addition, this will make easier for you to write your article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See how the previous paragraph is constructed, for example. I have stated a conclusion, then a premise indicator, and then a series of premises. It was very easy to writing the paragraph; I didn't even need to think about it. I just wrote something I thought was true, then provided a list of the reasons I thought it was true. How hard is that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a similar manner, an &lt;span&gt;explanation&lt;/span&gt; will also use indicator words. In fact, the indicator words used by explanations are very similar to those that are used by arguments. For example, I might explain by saying &quot;The grass is green because it rained yesterday.&quot; I am explaining why the grass is green. I am using the word 'because' as an indicator. And my explanation is offered following the word 'because'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often confuse arguments and explanations, because they use similar indicator words. So when you are writing, you can make your point clearer by using words that will generally be unique to explanations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, explanations are answers to 'why' questions. They consider why something happened 'instead of' something else. And usually, they will say that something was 'caused' by something else. So when offering an explanation, use these words as indicators. For example: &quot;It rained yesterday. That's why the grass is green, instead of brown.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost all explanations are &lt;span&gt;causal explanations,&lt;/span&gt; but in some cases (especially when describing complex states and events) you will also appeal to a &lt;span&gt;statistical explanation&lt;/span&gt;. In essence, in a statistical explanation, you are saying, &quot;it had to happen sometime, so that's why it happened now, but there's no reason, other than probability, why it happened this time instead o last time or next time.&quot; When people see somebody who was killed by lightening, and they say, &quot;His number was just up,&quot; they are offering a statistical explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Definitions&lt;/span&gt; are trickier, because there are various types of definition. I will consider three types of definition: ostensive, lexical, and implicit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An '&lt;span&gt;ostensive&lt;/span&gt;' definition is an act of naming by pointing. You point to a dog and you say, &quot;That's a dog.&quot; Do this enough times, and you have defined the concept of a dog. It's harder to point in text. But in text, a description amounts to the same thing as pointing. &quot;The legs are shorter than the tail. The colour is brown, and the body is very long. That's what I mean by a 'wiener dog'.&quot; As you may have noticed, the description is followed by the indicator words &quot;that's what I mean by&quot;. This makes it clear to the reader that you are defining by ostension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A '&lt;span&gt;lexical&lt;/span&gt;' definition is a definition one word or concept in terms of some other word or concept. Usually this is describes as providing the 'necessary and sufficient conditions' for being something. Another way of saying the same thing is to say that when you are defining a thing, you are saying that 'all and only' these things are the thing being defined. Yet another way of saying the same thing is to say that the thing belongs to such and such a category (all dogs are animals, or, a dog is necessarily an animal) and are distinguished from other members in such and such a way (only dogs pant, or, saying a thing is panting is sufficient to show that it is a dog).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may seem complicated, but the result is that a lexical definition has a very simply and easy to write form: A (thing being defined) is a type of (category) which is (distinguishing feature). For example, &quot;A dog is an animal that pants.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sentence may look just like a description, so it is useful to indicate to the reader that you are defining the term 'dog', and not describing a dog. For example, &quot;A 'dog' is defined as 'an animal that pants'.&quot; Notice how this is clearly a definition, and could not be confused as a mere description.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third type of definition is an &lt;span&gt;implicit&lt;/span&gt; definition. This occurs when you don't point to things, and don't place the thing being defined into categories, but rather, list instances of the thing being defined. For example, &quot;Civilization is when people are polite to each other. When people can trust the other person. When there is order in the streets.&quot; And so on. Or: &quot;You know what I mean. Japan is civilized. Singapore is civilized. Canada is civilized.&quot; Here we haven't listed necessary and sufficient conditions, but rather, offered enough of a description as to allow people to recognize instances of 'civilization' by their resemblance to the things being described.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the &lt;span&gt;description&lt;/span&gt; employs the 'subject predicate object' form that you learned in school. The 'subject' is the thing being described. The 'predicate' is something that is true of the subject - some action it is undertaking, or, if the predicate is 'is', some property that it possesses. And the 'object' may be some other entity that forms a part of the description.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, the sentences that form a description are related to each other. This relation is made explicit with a set of indicator words. For example, if the relation is chronological, the words might be 'first'... 'and then'... 'and finally'...! Or, 'yesterday'... 'then today'... 'and tomorrow'...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this essay, the method employed was to identify a list of things - argument, explanation, definition, and description - and then to use each of these terms in the sequence. For example, &quot;An argument will consist of a ...&quot; Notice that I actually went through this list twice, first describing the parts of each of the four items, and then describing the indicator words used for each of the four items. Also, when I went through the list the second time, I offered for each type of sentence a subdivision. For example, I identified inductive and deductive arguments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, now, here is the full set of types of things I have described (with indicator words in brackets):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Argument (premise: 'since', 'because'; conclusion: 'therefore', 'so')&lt;br/&gt;Deductive&lt;br/&gt;Categorical ('all', 'only', 'no', 'none', 'some')&lt;br/&gt;Propositional ('if', 'or', 'and')&lt;br/&gt;Inductive&lt;br/&gt;Generalization ('sample', 'poll', 'observation')&lt;br/&gt;Statistical ('most', 'generally, 'usually', 'seventy percent', 'nine out of ten')&lt;br/&gt;Universal ('always' and 'all')&lt;br/&gt;Causal ('causes')&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explanation ('why', 'instead of')&lt;br/&gt;Causal ('caused')&lt;br/&gt;Statistical ('percent', 'probability')&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Definition ('is a', 'is defined as')&lt;br/&gt;Ostensive ( 'That's what I mean by...' )&lt;br/&gt;Lexical ('All', 'Only', 'is a type of', 'is necessarily')&lt;br/&gt;Implicit ('is a', 'for example')&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;br/&gt;Chronology ('yesterday', 'today')&lt;br/&gt;Sensations ('seems', 'feels', 'appears', etc.,)&lt;br/&gt;List ('first', 'second', etc.)&lt;br/&gt;5 W's ('who', 'what', 'where', 'when', 'why')&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Complex Forms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you have seen in this article, each successive iteration (which has been followed by one of my tables) has been more and more detailed. You might ask how this is so, if there are only four types of article or essay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point is, each sentence in one type of thing might be a whole set of sentence of another type of thing. This is most clearly illustrated by looking at an argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An argument is a conclusion and some premises. Like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statement 1, and&lt;br/&gt;Statement 2,&lt;br/&gt;Thus,&lt;br/&gt;Statement 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But each premise might in turn be the conclusion of another argument. Like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statement 4, and&lt;br/&gt;Statement 5,&lt;br/&gt;Thus,&lt;br/&gt;Statement 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which gives us a complex argument:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statement 4, and&lt;br/&gt;Statement 5,&lt;br/&gt;Thus, Statement 1&lt;br/&gt;Statement 2&lt;br/&gt;Thus Statement 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this can be done with all four types of paragraph. For example, consider this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statement 1 (which is actually a definition, with several parts)&lt;br/&gt;Statement 2 (which is actually a description)&lt;br/&gt;Thus,&lt;br/&gt;Statement 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, when you write your essay, you pick the main thing you want to say. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statement 1, and&lt;br/&gt;Statement 2&lt;br/&gt;Thus&lt;br/&gt;Statement 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statement 4 (thing being defined)&lt;br/&gt;Statement 5 (properties)&lt;br/&gt;Statement 1 (actual definition)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth Paragraph&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statement 5 (first statement of description)&lt;br/&gt;Statement 6 (second statement of description)&lt;br/&gt;Statement 2 (summary of description)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, each simple element of an essay - premise, for example - can become a complex part of an essay - the premise could be the conclusion of an argument, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so, when you write your essay, you just go deeper and deeper into the structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you may ask: where does it stop?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, it stops with descriptions - something I've seen or experienced, or a reference to a study or a paper. To someone else, it all reduces to definitions and axioms. For someone else, it might never stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you rarely get to the bottom. You simply go on until you've said enough. In essence, you give up, and hope the reader can continue the rest of the way on his or her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And just so with this paper. I would now look at each one of each type of argument and explanation, for example, and identify more types, or describe features that make some good and some bad, or add many more examples and animations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But my time is up, I need to board my flight, so I'll stop here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing fancy at the end. Just a reminder, that this is how you can write great articles and essays, first draft, every time. Off the top of your head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yew is a modern Rust framework inspired by Elm and ReactJS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cutting Edge technologies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rust to WASM compilation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This framework designed to be compiled into modern browsers' runtimes: wasm, asm.js, emscripten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Clean MVC approach inspired by Elm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-rust&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Model&lt;/span&gt; { }

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Msg&lt;/span&gt; {
    DoIt,
}

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;(_: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt; Context&amp;lt;Msg&amp;gt;, model: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt; Model, msg: Msg) {
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;match&lt;/span&gt; msg {
        Msg&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;DoIt &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; {
            &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;// Update your model on events&lt;/span&gt;
        }
    }
}

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;view&lt;/span&gt;(model: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;Model) -&amp;gt; html::Html&amp;lt;Msg&amp;gt; {
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;html!&lt;/span&gt; {
        &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;// Render your model here&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;button onclick&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;_&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; Msg&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;DoIt,&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{ &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;Click me!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; }&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;VirtualDOM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yew framework uses own virtual-dom representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;JSX-like templates with &lt;code&gt;html!&lt;/code&gt; macro&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put pure Rust code into HTML tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-rust&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;html!&lt;/span&gt; {
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;section class&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;todoapp&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;header class&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;header&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{ &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;todos&quot;&lt;/span&gt; }&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            { &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;view_input&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;model) }
        &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;header&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;section class&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;main&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;input class&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;toggle-all&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
                   type&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;checkbox&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
                   checked&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;model.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;is_all_completed&lt;/span&gt;(),
                   onclick&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;_&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; Msg&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;ToggleAll, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            { &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;view_entries&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;model) }
        &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;section&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;section&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rust/JS/C-style comments in templates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use single-line or multi-line Rust comments inside html-templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-rust&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;html!&lt;/span&gt; {
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;section&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;/* Write some ideas&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;    * in multiline comments&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;    */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{ &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;and tags could be placed between comments!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; }&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;// &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;{ &quot;or single-line comments&quot; }&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;section&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pure Rust expressions inside&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-rust&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;crate&lt;/span&gt; chrono;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; chrono&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;prelude&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;view&lt;/span&gt;(model: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;Model) -&amp;gt; Html&amp;lt;Msg&amp;gt; {
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;html!&lt;/span&gt; {
        &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{ Local&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;() }&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Services&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pluggable services that allow you to call external APIs like: JavaScript alerts, timeout, storage, fetches and websockets. It's a handy alternative to subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implemented:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IntervalService&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;TimeoutService&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;StorageService&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;AlertSerivce&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In development:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;FetchService&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;WebSocketService&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-rust&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; yew&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;services&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;timeout&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;TimeoutService;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;(context: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt; Context&amp;lt;Msg&amp;gt;, model: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt; Model, msg: Msg) {
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;match&lt;/span&gt; msg {
        Msg&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;Fire &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; {
            context.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;timeout&lt;/span&gt;(Duration&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;from_secs&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;), &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; Msg&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;Timeout);
        }
        Msg&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;Timeout &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; {
            &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;Timeout!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;);
        }
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Running the examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four examples to check how it works: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DenisKolodin/yew/blob/master/examples/counter&quot;&gt;counter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DenisKolodin/yew/blob/master/examples/timer&quot;&gt;timer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DenisKolodin/yew/blob/master/examples/todomvc&quot;&gt;todomvc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DenisKolodin/yew/blob/master/examples/crm&quot;&gt;crm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run them you need to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/koute/cargo-web&quot;&gt;cargo-web&lt;/a&gt; installed as well as a suitable target for the Rust compiler to generate web output. By default cargo-web uses &lt;code&gt;asmjs-unknown-emscripten&lt;/code&gt;. Install cargo-web and the asmjs emscripten target as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ cargo install cargo-web
$ rustup target add asmjs-unknown-emscripten
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start an example enter its directory start it with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/koute/cargo-web&quot;&gt;cargo-web&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ cargo web start
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run an optimised build instead of a debug build use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ cargo web start --release
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/article&gt;</description>

<title>Xv6, a simple Unix-like teaching operating system</title>
<link>https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2017/xv6.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2017/xv6.html</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
Xv6 is a teaching operating system developed in the summer of 2006 for MIT's operating systems course, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828&quot;&gt;6.828: Operating System Engineering&lt;/a&gt;. We hope that xv6 will be useful in other courses too. This page collects resources to aid the use of xv6 in other courses, including a commentary on the source code itself.
&lt;h2&gt;History and Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many years, MIT had no operating systems course. In the fall of 2002, one was created to teach operating systems engineering. In the course lectures, the class worked through &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2017/xv6.html#v6&quot;&gt;Sixth Edition Unix (aka V6)&lt;/a&gt; using John Lions's famous commentary. In the lab assignments, students wrote most of an exokernel operating system, eventually named Jos, for the Intel x86. Exposing students to multiple systems–V6 and Jos–helped develop a sense of the spectrum of operating system designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V6 presented pedagogic challenges from the start. Students doubted the relevance of an obsolete 30-year-old operating system written in an obsolete programming language (pre-K&amp;amp;R C) running on obsolete hardware (the PDP-11). Students also struggled to learn the low-level details of two different architectures (the PDP-11 and the Intel x86) at the same time. By the summer of 2006, we had decided to replace V6 with a new operating system, xv6, modeled on V6 but written in ANSI C and running on multiprocessor Intel x86 machines. Xv6's use of the x86 makes it more relevant to students' experience than V6 was and unifies the course around a single architecture. Adding multiprocessor support requires handling concurrency head on with locks and threads (instead of using special-case solutions for uniprocessors such as enabling/disabling interrupts) and helps relevance. Finally, writing a new system allowed us to write cleaner versions of the rougher parts of V6, like the scheduler and file system. 6.828 substituted xv6 for V6 in the fall of 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Xv6 sources and text&lt;/h2&gt;
The latest xv6 source is available via
&lt;pre&gt;
git clone git://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public.git
&lt;/pre&gt;
We also distribute the sources as a printed booklet with line numbers that keep everyone together during lectures. The booklet is available as &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2017/xv6/xv6-rev10.pdf&quot;&gt;xv6-rev10.pdf&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;The xv6 source code is licensed under the traditional &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php&quot;&gt;MIT license&lt;/a&gt;; see the LICENSE file in the source distribution. To help students read through xv6 and learn about the main ideas in operating systems we also distribute a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2017/xv6/book-rev10.pdf&quot;&gt;textbook/commentary&lt;/a&gt; for the latest xv6. The line numbers in this book refer to the above source booklet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xv6 compiles using the GNU C compiler, targeted at the x86 using ELF binaries. On BSD and Linux systems, you can use the native compilers; On OS X, which doesn't use ELF binaries, you must use a cross-compiler. Xv6 does boot on real hardware, but typically we run it using the QEMU emulator. Both the GCC cross compiler and QEMU can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2017/tools.html&quot;&gt;6.828 tools page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Xv6 lecture material&lt;/h2&gt;
In 6.828, the lectures in the first half of the course cover the xv6 sources and text. The lectures in the second half consider advanced topics using research papers; for some, xv6 serves as a useful base for making discussions concrete. The lecture notes are available from the 6.828 &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2017/schedule.html&quot;&gt;schedule&lt;/a&gt; page.
&lt;h2&gt;Xv6 homeworks&lt;/h2&gt;
The Xv6 homeworks consist of small programming exercises that extend xv6 in interesting ways. By getting their hands dirty with xv6, students have an opportunity to absorb xv6 and explore ideas that are not covered in the text. The homeworks are available from the 6.828 &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2017/schedule.html&quot;&gt;schedule&lt;/a&gt; page. 
&lt;h2&gt;Unix Version 6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.828's xv6 is inspired by Unix V6 and by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lions' &lt;em&gt;Commentary on UNIX' 6th Edition&lt;/em&gt;, John Lions, Peer to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14, 2000).
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The following are useful to read the original code:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PDP11/40 Processor Handbook&lt;/em&gt;, Digital Equipment Corporation, 1972.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2005/readings/pdp11-40.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt; (made from scanned images, and not text-searchable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2005/pdp11/&quot;&gt;web-based version&lt;/a&gt; that is indexed by instruction name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
If you are interested in using xv6 or have used xv6 in a course, we would love to hear from you. If there's anything that we can do to make xv6 easier to adopt, we'd like to hear about it. We'd also be interested to hear what worked well and what didn't.

&lt;p name=&quot;cff6&quot; id=&quot;cff6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;The journey so far&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cc97&quot; id=&quot;cc97&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Just over a year ago, my company, Hiri (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hiri.com&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.hiri.com&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.hiri.com&lt;/a&gt;) was approached by Canonical to create a Snap of our email client. Turns out there aren’t a lot of email clients for Linux users that work with Exchange / Office 365. Although we were delighted that Canonical had reached out, we were reluctant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5c37&quot; id=&quot;5c37&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Six months prior, we had produced a tarball (mainly as our own development team wanted a Linux version) and we thought we’d try marketing to Linux users. First stop, Reddit. We wanted to engage with the r/linux community and get a sense of whether or not they would pay for a proprietary product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3b75&quot; id=&quot;3b75&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Although we received a lot of support, based on the majority of the comments, it didn’t sound promising. Just two examples; &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;“This is going to be a very hard sell being a proprietary closed source system to Linux users, many use Linux because they have bought into the idea of open source. Good luck with it anyway”&lt;/em&gt; wrote one user. Another said &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;“If it were FOSS, I would have downloaded it and compiled it 20 minutes ago.”&lt;/em&gt; We promptly shelved our Linux ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;370f&quot; id=&quot;370f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But the guys from Canonical were persuasive. They had a vision. They wanted to bring Ubuntu to the widest possible audience. To do this, they needed to attract more software to the OS. More than that, this software should be easy to find, update and install. They created Snappy, a software deployment and package management system. The resultant Snaps would be available on the Ubuntu Software Center (amongst other places) — essentially an app store for Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;76ad&quot; id=&quot;76ad&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We bit the bullet and spent some time creating the Snap. The opportunity to reach a new market at scale was too good to miss. Building the Snap itself was not that easy — Snaps were pretty new at the time. For example, strict confinement meant that we had to limit some of our product features. But a little help from Canonical and we were up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6e96&quot; id=&quot;6e96&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;That was over a year ago. Was it worth it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7f4e&quot; id=&quot;7f4e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The short answer is yes. Although with some caveats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f1a6&quot; id=&quot;f1a6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;By far, most of our Linux downloads now come through Snaps, although tracking exactly where those Snap installs are coming from isn’t possible at the moment, as Snaps are available online and on other distros. Success on any app store is contingent on the amount of exposure you get on the front page/editorial sections. And getting exposure is reliant upon the good will of editors of the Software Center — not something you can, or should be able to, rely on. This is also a problem on the Mac and Windows stores — developers will never feel like they are getting enough exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5d99&quot; id=&quot;5d99&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;However, the store certainly increased awareness in the early days. And the effect has been lasting. That early user base has been spreading the word. Most of our paid Linux users are a result of word of mouth. This is not the case for Windows/Mac guys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;eac9&quot; id=&quot;eac9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Financially speaking, I do believe you can make a living out of selling software to Linux users alone. But we couldn’t rely on just Linux users right now. I will say that it pays for itself though, and the numbers are gradually increasing. The market is definitely large enough to support a business like ours. Worth noting that Hiri is Exchange/Office 365 only at the moment. We are working on Gmail/IMAP support, and we think this will attract a lot more Linux users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b059&quot; id=&quot;b059&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Pricing wise, we haven’t noticed anything that distinguishes Linux users from everyone else. They are no more cost conscious than Mac / Windows users. They are definitely willing to pay for software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;83fa&quot; id=&quot;83fa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The main challenge remains getting the word out. Unfortunately, the fundamentalist FOSS mentality we encountered on Reddit is still alive and well. Some Linux blogs and Podcasts simply won’t give us the time of day. This is not a problem with the mainstream tech blogs and is a problem unique to Linux. Thankfully, many publishers are OK with closed-source, paid-for software. It’s my firm belief that there is plenty of room for both models. There is a lot to be said for products that have been shaped by free market forces. If Linux as a platform is going to succeed, Linux users should think about the richness of the entire ecosystem rather than seek to limit it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;85d0&quot; id=&quot;85d0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The takeaway here? Well, maybe we should open source. But that’s not so easy in our case. We have professional VC’s and they would like to see us hold onto our intellectual property. And before you cry “support model!” — it isn’t going to work for us — our product simply doesn’t require that much support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;94fa&quot; id=&quot;94fa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The more obvious fragmentation problem is still a barrier to success. Snaps don’t cover some well known distros — Redhat, CentOS and Gentoo to name a few. Of course, we can create a Flatpak, but that’s one more platform to support, and making builds for different distros is not trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4df3&quot; id=&quot;4df3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Unsurprisingly, security is a major concern for Linux users. Thankfully, we learned this lesson early after watching several of our competitors getting roasted online for laissez-faire data collection. In many ways, we are lucky that our product is secure by design (we don’t store or process data online — strictly between you and your mail server). None the less, we are very open with users regarding the data we collect, and users can turn off what little data collection we do. Of course, the boundaries are much clearer now thanks to GDPR. Startups are less likely to make privacy related blunders. But if you are creating a product, think twice about using 3rd party services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2c57&quot; id=&quot;2c57&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Privacy is something you need to be mindful of when it comes to marketing too. We used to send automatically triggered emails welcoming you to the product and teaching you how to get the most from the product. A fairly typical startup tactic used to overcome adoption issues. This isn’t a problem for Mac/Windows users, but this is a step too far for Linux people. We simply stopped doing this. Of course, there are ways around this. Nobody minds getting in-app notifications for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8f15&quot; id=&quot;8f15&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The most surprising and delightful aspect of this journey has been the feedback from Linux users. To put it mildly, they care about software. Many of them are software developers themselves. We call it professional sympathy! Their generosity, quality insights and willingness to help us squash bugs have accelerated the pace of our development and learning dramatically. So much so, that if I ever end up building another product, I’ll be going Linux first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4090&quot; id=&quot;4090&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Do I have any tips for those of you considering selling on Linux? You bet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;0a91&quot; id=&quot;0a91&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Engage with Canonical. They are approachable, super helpful and want your Snap to succeed. They have a strong marketing department.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;d6d9&quot; id=&quot;d6d9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Forge strong relationships with your Linux users. Make it easy for them to get in touch. Listen to them. Linux is a community — word will spread!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;e805&quot; id=&quot;e805&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Use the Snap beta channel. It’s a great way to set realistic expectations and get feedback on new features. It’s another great way to build relationships with your users. Wish we had done this sooner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;2c39&quot; id=&quot;2c39&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Allow your users to contribute, but reward them for their contribution. We’re offering a free license to anyone that will help us translate Hiri.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;7b96&quot; id=&quot;7b96&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;There’s no escaping the grind. Link build, reach out to journalists. Talk to Podcasters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;6afb&quot; id=&quot;6afb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Release often. We didn’t update for quite some time because we were working on something big. A lot of users wrote to us wondering if we were dead! Nobody wants to buy a product that is no longer supported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;4b6f&quot; id=&quot;4b6f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Give users somewhere they can add, vote and comment on ideas. Linux users want to help you shape the product. This is a great way to improve product/market fit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;13c4&quot; id=&quot;13c4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li graf--trailing&quot;&gt;Questions? Comments? Ask below and I’ll do my best to answer!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What was it like to be a software engineer at NeXT?</title>
<link>https://www.quora.com/What-was-it-like-to-be-a-software-engineer-at-NeXT-Did-workers-interact-with-Steve-Jobs/answer/Paul-King-2</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.quora.com/What-was-it-like-to-be-a-software-engineer-at-NeXT-Did-workers-interact-with-Steve-Jobs/answer/Paul-King-2</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;Working at NeXT was the most exciting software engineering job I ever accepted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;NeXT was like graduate school, bringing together a high concentration of some of the brightest and most innovative technical minds. Many people had computer science (or other) research backgrounds. One thing that was unusual is that all the technical people there understood all aspects of the machine. Software people could talk about ASICs and CPU instructions, and the hardware people understood the software stack. Every aspect of what it takes to make a computer work was represented in one building: analog hardware, chip design, motherboard design, compiler design (Objective-C), loader, operating system, windowing system, application layer, and applications. Where other companies had engineering teams, NeXT would have a single individual. Many people had been managers or technical leads elsewhere and came to NeXT to be an individual contributor to help create the most innovative computer ever invented (enter reality distortion field).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;When I joined, Steve Jobs was in a different building with the marketing folks, separated from the engineers. Supposedly the new campus had been planned that way so that Steve wouldn't tour around among the engineers, ask them what they were working on, and redirect them onto new projects when they were supposed to be working on deadlines. Because if Steve got excited and said something would be cool, engineers would stop whatever they were doing and start working on that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;At one point, Lotus Notes was getting traction and Steve thought it was interesting. He liked the idea of a network based application with information objects floating around. So he called a meeting with 10 software engineers around the giant board room table to brainstorm. It was exciting to be invited. The initiative got called Object Soup, and while nothing concrete emerged, it influenced the direction of parts of the software infrastructure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;Steve could also be ruthless with his feedback. In my first meeting with him to present what I had been working on (which was held on a Saturday morning), he looked at the demo for 5 minutes and told me I had &quot;ruined NeXTSTEP&quot; (the software platform). This was a 3 month build-up for a big demo on Monday (in 2 days) in front of the entire engineering division at Oracle (400+ people), by invitation of his close friend, CEO Larry Ellison. Steve said the work was so bad, he thought he should cancel his presentation at Oracle. &quot;Unless...&quot;, he paused with a twinkle in his eye, &quot;there is a way of making it work like the old way,&quot; referring to the smoke-and-mirrors demo he had been using on sales calls. We knew what we had to do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;We worked through the night to pull out all of the SQL-specific features he didn't like, and met him at the office Sunday morning. He reviewed the demo for 2 minutes and said enthusiastically, &quot;This is 10 times, no 100 times, no 1000 times better!!!&quot; The Monday demo was on, and Steve received a standing ovation from the Oracle employees.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Related&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;qlink_container&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-was-it-like-to-work-at-NeXT&quot;&gt;What was it like to work at NeXT?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;I recently graduated and have been grinding for interview prep (leetcode and CTCI mostly), but I’m getting no where. Easy problems take me 2-5 hours. I experience PTSD like symptoms from the constant barrage of negative thoughts the difficulty and stress of doing these problems are causing me. I don’t have time to do anything else and no objectively measurable progress is being made. Even if I get a problem right, I gain little to no satisfaction at this point. I completely hate what I’ve gotten myself into. I put all my eggs in the “being a programmer” basket and it’s clearly not for me. I do have a computer science undergraduate degree which I’m hoping I can use for something. Are there any career paths I can pivot to that are less cognitively demanding than software engineering where this degree would be an asset?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td/&gt;

Rubble is scattered along the train tracks, bordered by retaining walls covered in numerous layers of graffiti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;text_00bc4b37757149ea89b8d6d42fa83aa6&quot; class=&quot;TextBlock&quot; data-role=&quot;paragraph&quot; data-type=&quot;text&quot; data-align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;This is where it all started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;text_e3b5e6194d87402b9602ac63a00ced2e&quot; class=&quot;TextBlock&quot; data-role=&quot;paragraph&quot; data-type=&quot;text&quot; data-align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Here by the parkway with the blasting trucks and the roaring cars, near the filigree arches of the Riverside Drive viaduct, here with the gravel crunching under my feet as I run down the railroad into this hollow mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;text_4bd95c870a39499090e0703d0b673d81&quot; class=&quot;TextBlock&quot; data-role=&quot;paragraph&quot; data-type=&quot;text&quot; data-align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;This is where they live, deep into the depths of the city, way underground, lying in the dirt. Sure, you know about them. Of course you know about them. They’ve always been there, resting low below the rowdy streets and the carving avenues, gulping the air from inside the earth, crawling through holes and cracks, living off the grid and off the books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;text_255378998da14eddbc33e2c130c5256b&quot; class=&quot;TextBlock&quot; data-role=&quot;paragraph&quot; data-type=&quot;text&quot; data-align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Here in the tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;text_1d361ec35e22464ca9fdf01c31c8f297&quot; class=&quot;TextBlock&quot; data-role=&quot;paragraph&quot; data-type=&quot;text&quot; data-align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;You’ve heard the rumors. Their eyes have adapted to the constant night that cloaks them from the topside world. Don’t you know they’re eating rats and human flesh? Don’t you know they want us dead? And one day they will spill outside and burn us all alive, and they will reign over our flatscreen joys and our organic delights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;text_b0a1ec17bd6d4d1a868432fbffa5b18b&quot; class=&quot;TextBlock&quot; data-role=&quot;paragraph&quot; data-type=&quot;text&quot; data-align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Of course you know about them. The lost ones, the hidden ones. The broken and the ill, the wandering, the gone. The Mole People.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;text_3e1c5cfe622e4f32a9f38773e3a225b8&quot; class=&quot;TextBlock&quot; data-role=&quot;paragraph&quot; data-type=&quot;text&quot; data-align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;“Jon,” I call, looking up. Jon has been homeless for more than fifteen years. Like many of the people interviewed for this article, he did not want to give his full name. He has been living here for a while now, in a small space between two support beams that can only be reached with a ladder. A plywood roof protects his hoarded belongings from seeping water. The place is crammed full. There is an old mattress on the floor, and cookware, blankets and electronics stacked on makeshift shelves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;text_07760b1cc2904e11936d0ab45ad5cb09&quot; class=&quot;TextBlock&quot; data-role=&quot;paragraph&quot; data-type=&quot;text&quot; data-align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;“Jon,” I repeat, and he appears, his head cautiously peaking up from his house, a relieved smile on his face when he sees me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;text_3160cf6edd9644a79901fdce7af10e60&quot; class=&quot;TextBlock&quot; data-role=&quot;paragraph&quot; data-type=&quot;text&quot; data-align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;“I thought it was the Amtrak police,” he later says while opening a beer, his legs dangling off the edge of the wall. “They been coming less, lately, but you never know. Regular police ain’t bothering me, but Amtrak, they can be nasty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;text_91e23ac6d4a544948f78817565ba0c0b&quot; class=&quot;TextBlock&quot; data-role=&quot;paragraph&quot; data-type=&quot;text&quot; data-align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Jon says he did prison time. He is bipolar and suffers from major substance dependence. He used to be a gang member in the Bronx. He used to be a family man until he got disowned. He was a furniture salesman. The FBI is looking for him. He used to know Donald Trump. It doesn’t matter which version is true. His real story has been buried long ago under thick layers of improvised memories that grew more detailed by the years, the man slowly becoming a collage of himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;text_55f10ea9c7db4293bfc6934827d00d63&quot; class=&quot;TextBlock&quot; data-role=&quot;paragraph&quot; data-type=&quot;text&quot; data-align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;“I’m good here,” he says. “No taxes, no rent, no nothing. There’s no hassle compared to the streets, you know what I’m saying? Here I don’t get bugged by kids. It’s a safe place. I can do what I wanna and I don’t have to take nothing from nobody.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;text_77cffc9fb1984f8da2227dd2781c581d&quot; class=&quot;TextBlock&quot; data-role=&quot;paragraph&quot; data-type=&quot;text&quot; data-align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;“You’re the first person to visit this week,” he says. “People don’t want to speak to me when they come here. I don’t know, man. They’re scared or something. I can get why, it’s a spooky place when you don’t know it. But people, they like it when it’s scary. They like it when it’s dirty, right? It makes them feel alive. That’s why they make up these stories about cannibalism and stuff. Like alligators in the sewers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;text_b4486d0a5d364fba8cc8fcf28cf8193d&quot; class=&quot;TextBlock&quot; data-role=&quot;paragraph&quot; data-type=&quot;text&quot; data-align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Jon offers me a sip of vodka. We drink together. He tells me to stay safe and to watch out for trains when I go back walking into the tunnel. I hear him talk to himself as I go away from the entrance and from the white sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;text_0ad3332060d04f6a96805e946ff989bc&quot; class=&quot;TextBlock&quot; data-role=&quot;paragraph&quot; data-type=&quot;text&quot; data-align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;The smell down here is the one of brake dust and mold. I can see rats scouring for food and drinking from brown puddles in the tracks ballast. EXISTENCE IS FLAWED, a graffiti inscription reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;text_5e4c71aade914b519aca5da22372a992&quot; class=&quot;TextBlock&quot; data-role=&quot;paragraph&quot; data-type=&quot;text&quot; data-align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;The city growls over my head — a distant growl muffled by the concrete, almost a snarl, like something cold and foul spreading over the long stretches of stained walls, like a dark and wild beast curling up around me and breathing on my neck. A dark and wild beast silently trailing me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;text_aa7422c9b6c2417d8d2d7eb102c11056&quot; class=&quot;TextBlock&quot; data-role=&quot;paragraph&quot; data-type=&quot;text&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

The expansion of extensive sewers and steam pipes systems had brought a newfound fascination with what laid below the streets. From Jules Verne’s 1864 novel “Journey to the Center of the Earth” to George Gissing’s 1889 book “The Nether World,” literature was brimming with tales of people living in isolation or trapped under the surface, peaking in 1895 with “The Time Machine,” in which H. G. Wells described a fictional subterranean species called the “Morlocks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;text_cdd9ceab4ff04488964e17206bf2750b&quot; class=&quot;TextBlock&quot; data-role=&quot;paragraph&quot; data-type=&quot;text&quot; data-align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;But it was only in the 1990s that the first widespread depictions of real-world tunnel residents appeared in New York. A 1990 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/13/nyregion/in-tunnel-mole-people-fight-to-save-home.html?pagewanted=all&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; by John Tierney was the earliest to outline the phenomenon, looking at people living in an abandoned train tunnel beneath Riverside Park, along the banks of the Hudson River.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;text_99e8a9e1b8514d729575d0a1febf2963&quot; class=&quot;TextBlock&quot; data-role=&quot;paragraph&quot; data-type=&quot;text&quot; data-align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Collective imagination took over quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

An instant hit, it chronicled the organization of those underground societies, describing compounds of several thousands where babies were born and regular lives were lived, with elected officials, hot water and even electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

Joseph Brennan, a New York rail buff, wrote an extensive and detailed critique in 1996, exposing many discrepancies in Toth’s reporting, such as places that couldn’t exist, exaggerated numbers and contradictory claims. According to Brennan, the whole notion of secret passages was implausible and “reminiscent of scenes in the TV series ‘Beauty and the Beast.’”&lt;/p&gt;

Adams pointed out unverifiable or incorrect facts in Toth’s work, and her skepticism peaked during her interview of Cindy Fletcher, a former tunnel dweller who challenged important points of the narration. “I’m not saying the book is not true, I just never experienced the things [she] said she saw,” Fletcher explained to Adams. I was unable to reach Toth for comment, but when Adams talked to her, the journalist said she couldn’t remember how to access certain places described in her essay — possibly not to disclose the whereabouts of trespassing squatters.&lt;/p&gt;

Photojournalists &lt;a href=&quot;http://margaretmorton.com/artist/the_tunnel.html&quot;&gt;Margaret Morton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.andreastarreese.com/the-urban-cave-3&quot;&gt;Andrea Star Reese&lt;/a&gt; have both extensively documented communities spread in underground hideouts since Toth’s book. Dutch anthropologist Teun Voeten’s 1996 diary “Tunnel People” provided an &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.ca/books?id=5RWsvXPDCPYC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;incredible account&lt;/a&gt; of the months he spent with the Riverside Park Amtrak tunnel inhabitants before they were evicted and moved to Section 8 housing units. In 2000, director Marc Singer released his acclaimed documentary “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0235327/&quot;&gt;Dark Days&lt;/a&gt;,” filming the same people followed by Voeten and Toth in their respective books.&lt;/p&gt;

That they spoke their own language. Creepy stuff, straight out of a horror movie… Most was made-up. I personally never witnessed unusual stuff. Santa Claus, the Boogeyman, the Mole People, it’s all the same. We need to label things we don’t understand. It’s human nature.”&lt;/p&gt;

Written in an abandoned crew room of the F subway line, these words were the reason I ventured into the tunnels in the first place, looking for the invisible, guided by local dwellers along the years to seek foundations of humanity in the foundations of the city.&lt;/p&gt;

A place to find peace and take a break from the chaos.” He would then reminisce about his old life, his eyes would light up and there would be the crack of a smile, and whatever place we were in would be filled by his presence.&lt;/p&gt;

His BA in journalism and his studies in philosophy had somehow led him to work as a model, then as a TV crew member, then as a tour guide in the Caribbean where he began &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.ca/books?id=5RWsvXPDCPYC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=smuggled%20cocaine&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;smuggling cocaine&lt;/a&gt; to the States. The father of two sons with two different women, he never cared much for family life, preferring to spend his smuggling profits on parties thrown at his Upper West Side penthouse. Soon he was broke, friendless and on his own. By the late 1980s, he was sleeping in the Riverside Park tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;text_f2996498cf2545b8bba1ba7d021c6abc&quot; class=&quot;TextBlock&quot; data-role=&quot;paragraph&quot; data-type=&quot;text&quot; data-align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;The tunnel was known by homeless people since its inception in the 1930s, when it was used by trains to bring cattle to the city before the freight operations ended. Its population, limited at first to about three or four individuals, quickly grew at the time Isaac settled in, evolving into small tribes of vagrants who built thriving shantytowns in the newly abandoned space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;text_05a0f5b4fa3a40b7a592cbf6d3c3d6bd&quot; class=&quot;TextBlock&quot; data-role=&quot;paragraph&quot; data-type=&quot;text&quot; data-align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Few risked getting down into the tunnel. “It often scared grown men easily,” recounted Isaac in 2010 as he showed me his old hangout places. But those who did go down called it home, and it became a haven for the destitute to unwind without fear of getting arrested or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/04/nyregion/youths-injure-two-sleeping-homeless-men.html&quot;&gt;attacked like people on the streets often were&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

He laughed at them and said “Do you know who you’re talking to? I’m the fucking lord of this tunnel!” The three men never bothered him again, and Isaac’s nickname “The Lord of the Tunnel” was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;text_15b8e68adf124cf2b2928c06ba49c3c9&quot; class=&quot;TextBlock&quot; data-role=&quot;paragraph&quot; data-type=&quot;text&quot; data-align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Though there never was any real leader in the shantytown, Isaac became the community’s de facto spokesman, interacting with outreach groups and journalists to explain how living there was better than dealing with shelter curfews, senseless laws and indifferent social workers. Soon interest came from all around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;text_e7b4f7cedd294da18da54cce5ab4fa11&quot; class=&quot;TextBlock&quot; data-role=&quot;paragraph&quot; data-type=&quot;text&quot; data-align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Ironically, the tunnel’s community support was in many ways more efficient than the one offered by municipal programs. In the encampment, the dwellers had a familiar place to be, watch TV, read or smoke. They had autonomy. Rules were simple but strictly enforced. Respect for privacy. No yelling. No stealing. No stupid behavior or you’d be kicked out. Some, like Isaac, were at home in the darkness, and would not have lived anywhere else. Most who lived here did not consider themselves homeless.&lt;/p&gt;

One of them, Chris “Freedom” Pape, had known the place for quite a while before. He became friends with Isaac and his community, teaming up with local tagger Roger Smith — known to most as just “Smith” — to paint pieces narrating their stories. “I hadpainted in the tunnel for six years before the homeless moved in, so they were curious about me,” said Pape in a 2014 interview for “&lt;a href=&quot;http://untappedcities.com/2014/05/19/catching-up-with-chris-freedom-pape-the-artist-who-gave-nycs-freedom-tunnel-its-name/&quot;&gt;Untapped Cities&lt;/a&gt;.” “I became friendly with most of them and my visits to the tunnel were much safer and even relaxing.”&lt;/p&gt;

We dared to be ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;

He was back less than seven months later, the $50,000 Hollywood deal gone sour and Kovacs unable to adjust to life in larger society.&lt;/p&gt;

A heart attack forced him to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/28/nyregion/fleeing-the-world-underneath.html&quot;&gt;try his luck with the public housing system in 1994&lt;/a&gt;. He too returned in the following months. The sense of belonging simply was too strong. The tunnel was a better place for him to be alone in freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

The incentives paid by the Department of Homeless Services to landlords renting out shelter units far exceed the ones given for providing tenants with permanent single room occupancy lodging. In 2014, the average stay was &lt;a href=&quot;http://n90s.org/?p=902&quot;&gt;352 days at the Freedom House&lt;/a&gt;, a homeless shelter on West 95th Street managed by private company Aguila Inc. The city paid Aguila &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.vice.com/article/how-private-companies-are-profiting-from-homelessness-in-new-york-city&quot;&gt;$3,735 per month&lt;/a&gt; for each 100-square-foot room occupied by a homeless person.&lt;/p&gt;

Garbage piles up in the courtyard for rodents to feed on. Aggressive panhandling, drug dealing and violent outbursts are commonplace in the shelter’s vicinity. Sometimes a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.westsiderag.com/2013/10/10/television-tossed-from-95th-street-homeless-shelter&quot;&gt;TV is hurled out a window&lt;/a&gt;, or the police close the street after someone is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.westsiderag.com/2012/07/23/morning-bulletin-homicide-on-95th-street-train-death-on-59th&quot;&gt;stabbed in a fight&lt;/a&gt;. The NYPD &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/uptown/cops-push-raids-uws-homeless-shelters-article-1.1810775&quot;&gt;regularly raids&lt;/a&gt; the place looking for people with outstanding warrants, targeting domestic abusers and failing to arrest the major dealers or car thieves roaming the area. Aguila Inc. didn’t comment on the situation when I reached out to the company, but one of their security officers, who wished to remain anonymous because he feared reprisal from his employer, told me that the lack of resources, upkeep and care were the biggest issues in the facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

She will never go back. She was sixteen when she got pregnant with her daughter Alyssa. She briefly lived with the baby’s father until he tired of dealing with a needy toddler, leaving never to be seen again. Jessica was then diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and admitted to transitional housing in Brooklyn. She says that within a month, social services was badgering her to place her three-year-old in foster care.&lt;/p&gt;

I called my sister and begged her to take care of Alyssa until I found a place of my own. This was the most difficult thing I’ve ever done in my life, leaving my baby. But it was the right thing to do. At least she is with family. When she grows up I will explain it all to her.”&lt;/p&gt;

She began sleeping in a subway tunnel after transit authorities made her leave her spot in the Herald Square station corridor on 34th Street, dragging her by her feet when she refused to stand up from her mat. “At first I was like ‘I’m never going down there.’ But then Hurricane Sandy came and I had no place to stay, and I didn’t want to go to a shelter again with all the crackheads.”&lt;/p&gt;

There were 42,000 homeless children across the five boroughs in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

End of story. Everything else becomes a symptom. Drug issues, domestic violence issues, they’re all symptoms, as opposed to being a cause. The cause is lack of affordable housing.”&lt;/p&gt;

In a few years from now, it will be completely gone, washed away by the elements.&lt;/p&gt;

He is one of the few original dwellers who stayed. His house is small but very practical, entirely concealed by a metal lid he takes great care of pulling on every time he gets inside. “It’s a good hideout,” he explains in a thick Spanish accent.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m comfortable and no one can see me. I’m used to it now. It’s good for reading. I read a lot. All kinds of books. I read them and I sell them.”&lt;/p&gt;

Sometimes they try to make me leave. It’s my home, I tell them. Maybe I live like a mole, but I’m not an animal.” He just wants to be left alone.&lt;/p&gt;

Two femurs bundled in cargo pants, neatly laid into an old child stroller, with pieces of leathered skin still attached to them, and a skull standing on top of a nearby pole.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>BPG Image format</title>
<link>https://bellard.org/bpg/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://bellard.org/bpg/</guid>
<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&quot; /&gt;&lt;title&gt;BPG Image format&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;38.767851807589&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BPG (Better Portable Graphics) is a new image format. Its purpose is to replace the JPEG image format when quality or file size is an issue. Its main advantages are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High compression ratio. Files are much smaller than JPEG for similar quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supported by most Web browsers with a small Javascript decoder (gzipped size: 56 KB).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on a subset of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Video_Coding&quot;&gt;HEVC&lt;/a&gt; open video compression standard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports the same chroma formats as JPEG (grayscale, YCbCr 4:2:0, 4:2:2, 4:4:4) to reduce the losses during the conversion. An alpha channel is supported. The RGB, YCgCo and CMYK color spaces are also supported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Native support of 8 to 14 bits per channel for a higher dynamic range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lossless compression is supported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various metadata (such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchangeable_image_file_format&quot;&gt;EXIF&lt;/a&gt;, ICC profile, XMP) can be included.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Animation support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Download&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following archive contains the source code of the &lt;tt&gt;bpgenc&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;bpgdec&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;bpgview&lt;/tt&gt; command line utilities (for Linux) and the associated &lt;tt&gt;libbpg&lt;/tt&gt; library (read the README file in the archive). It also includes the source code of the Javascript decoder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bellard.org/bpg/libbpg-0.9.8.tar.gz&quot;&gt;libbpg-0.9.8.tar.gz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binary distribution for Windows (64 bit only): &lt;a href=&quot;https://bellard.org/bpg/bpg-0.9.8-win64.zip&quot;&gt;bpg-0.9.8-win64.zip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unofficial &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mirrorer/libbpg&quot;&gt;Github mirror&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Mac users, the BPG utilities are available in the &lt;tt&gt;libbpg&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://brew.sh/&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; formula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mozilla did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://people.mozilla.org/~josh/lossy_compressed_image_study_july_2014/&quot;&gt;study of various lossy compressed image formats&lt;/a&gt;. HEVC (hence BPG) was a clear winner by a wide margin. BPG files are actually a little smaller than raw HEVC files because the BPG header is smaller than the corresponding HEVC header.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BPG natively supports 8 to 14 bits per channel when most other formats use 8 bits (including most of the JPEG implementations and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP&quot;&gt;WEBP&lt;/a&gt;). It gives a higher dynamic range (which is important for cameras and new displays) and a slightly better compression ratio (because there are less rounding errors in the decoder).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BPG uses high quality decimation (10 tap Lanczos filter) and interpolation (7 tap Lanczos filter) to handle the chroma samples in 4:2:2 and 4:2:0 formats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BPG can be supported in hardware with standard HEVC decoders and encoders (it uses a subset of the Main 4:4:4 16 Still Picture Profile, Level 8.5).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Demo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Technical information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specification of the BPG file format is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://bellard.org/bpg/bpg_spec.txt&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Licensing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The BPG decoding library uses a modified version of FFmpeg released under the LGPL version 2.1 as HEVC decoder. The BPG decoding library excluding the FFmpeg code is released under the BSD license.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The BPG encoder as a whole is released under the GPL version 2 license. The BPG encoder sources excluding x265 are released under the BSD license. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.videolan.org/developers/x265.html&quot;&gt;x265&lt;/a&gt; library is released under the GPL version 2 license. The optional &lt;a href=&quot;https://hevc.hhi.fraunhofer.de/&quot;&gt;JCTVC HEVC reference encoder&lt;/a&gt; is released under the BSD license.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of the HEVC algorithms may be protected by patents in some countries (read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ffmpeg.org/legal.html&quot;&gt;FFmpeg Patent Mini-FAQ&lt;/a&gt; for more information). Most devices already include or will include hardware HEVC support, so we suggest to use it if patents are an issue.&lt;/li&gt;

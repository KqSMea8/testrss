<description>&lt;p id=&quot;standfirst&quot; class=&quot;article__standfirst&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Using sleep deprivation to lift people out of severe depression may seem counterintuitive, but for some people, it’s the only thing that works. Linda Geddes reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;article__aside&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;article__section article__section--default&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph paragraph--text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first sign that something is happening is Angelina’s hands. As she chats to the nurse in Italian, she begins to gesticulate, jabbing, moulding and circling the air with her fingers. As the minutes pass and Angelina becomes increasingly animated, I notice a musicality to her voice that I’m sure wasn’t there earlier. The lines in her forehead seem to be softening, and the pursing and stretching of her lips and the crinkling of her eyes tell me as much about her mental state as any interpreter could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angelina is coming to life, precisely as my body is beginning to shut down. It’s 2am, and we’re sat in the brightly lit kitchen of a Milanese psychiatric ward, eating spaghetti. There’s a dull ache behind my eyes, and I keep on zoning out, but Angelina won’t be going to bed for at least another 17 hours, so I’m steeling myself for a long night. In case I doubted her resolve, Angelina removes her glasses, looks directly at me, and uses her thumbs and forefingers to pull open the wrinkled, grey-tinged skin around her eyes. “Occhi aperti,” she says. Eyes open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second night in three that Angelina has been deliberately deprived of sleep. For a person with bipolar disorder who has spent the past two years in a deep and crippling depression, it may sound like the last thing she needs, but Angelina – and the doctors treating her – hope it will be her salvation. For two decades, Francesco Benedetti, who heads the psychiatry and clinical psychobiology unit at San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, has been investigating so-called wake therapy, in combination with bright light exposure and lithium, as a means of treating depression where drugs have often failed. As a result, psychiatrists in the USA, the UK and other European countries are starting to take notice, launching variations of it in their own clinics. These ‘chronotherapies’ seem to work by kick-starting a sluggish biological clock; in doing so, they’re also shedding new light on the underlying pathology of depression, and on the function of sleep more generally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sleep deprivation really has opposite effects in healthy people and those with depression,” says Benedetti. If you’re healthy and you don’t sleep, you’ll feel in a bad mood. But if you’re depressed, it can prompt an immediate improvement in mood, and in cognitive abilities. But, Benedetti adds, there’s a catch: once you go to sleep and catch up on those missed hours of sleep, you’ll have a 95 per cent chance of relapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation was first published in a report in Germany in 1959. This captured the imagination of a young researcher from Tübingen in Germany, Burkhard Pflug, who investigated the effect in his doctoral thesis and in subsequent studies during the 1970s. By systematically depriving depressed people of sleep, he confirmed that spending a single night awake could jolt them out of depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benedetti became interested in this idea as a young psychiatrist in the early 1990s. Prozac had been launched just a few years earlier, hailing a revolution in the treatment of depression. But such drugs were rarely tested on people with bipolar disorder. Bitter experience has since taught Benedetti that antidepressants are largely ineffective for people with bipolar depression anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His patients were in desperate need of an alternative, and his supervisor, Enrico Smeraldi, had an idea up his sleeve. Having read some of the early papers on wake therapy, he tested their theories on his own patients, with positive results. “We knew it worked,” says Benedetti. “Patients with these terrible histories were getting well immediately. My task was finding a way of making them stay well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he and his colleagues turned to the scientific literature for ideas. A handful of American studies had suggested that lithium might prolong the effect of sleep deprivation, so they investigated that. They found that 65 per cent of patients taking lithium showed a sustained response to sleep deprivation when assessed after three months, compared to just 10 per cent of those not taking the drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since even a short nap could undermine the efficacy of the treatment, they also started searching for new ways of keeping patients awake at night, and drew inspiration from aviation medicine, where bright light was being used to keep pilots alert. This too extended the effects of sleep deprivation, to a similar extent as lithium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We decided to give them the whole package, and the effect was brilliant,” says Benedetti. By the late 1990s, they were routinely treating patients with triple chronotherapy: sleep deprivation, lithium and light. The sleep deprivations would occur every other night for a week, and bright light exposure for 30 minutes each morning would be continued for a further two weeks – a protocol they continue to use to this day. “We can think of it not as sleep-depriving people, but as modifying or enlarging the period of the sleep–wake cycle from 24 to 48 hours,” says Benedetti. “People go to bed every two nights, but when they go to bed, they can sleep for as long as they want.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Raffaele Hospital first introduced triple chronotherapy in 1996. Since then, it has treated close to a thousand patients with bipolar depression – many of whom had failed to respond to antidepressant drugs. The results speak for themselves: according to the most recent data, 70 per cent of people with drug-resistant bipolar depression responded to triple chronotherapy within the first week, and 55 per cent had a sustained improvement in their depression one month later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And whereas antidepressants – if they work – can take over a month to have an effect, and can increase the risk of suicide in the meantime, chronotherapy usually produces an immediate and persistent decrease in suicidal thoughts, even after just one night of sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;article__section article__section--default&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph paragraph--text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angelina was first diagnosed with bipolar disorder 30 years ago, when she was in her late 30s. The diagnosis followed a period of intense stress: her husband was facing a tribunal at work, and they were worried about having enough money to support themselves and the kids. Angelina fell into a depression that lasted nearly three years. Since then, her mood has oscillated, but she’s down more often than not. She takes an arsenal of drugs – antidepressants, mood stabilisers, anti-anxiety drugs and sleeping tablets – which she dislikes because they make her feel like a patient, even though she acknowledges this is what she is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I’d met her three days ago, she says, it’s unlikely I would have recognised her. She didn’t want to do anything, she’d stopped washing her hair or wearing make-up, and she stank. She also felt very pessimistic about the future. After her first night of sleep deprivation, she’d felt more energetic, but this largely subsided after her recovery sleep. Even so, today she felt motivated enough to visit a hairdresser in anticipation of my visit. I compliment her appearance, and she pats her dyed, golden waves, thanking me for noticing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 3am, we move to the light room, and entering is like being transported forward to midday. Bright sunlight streams in through the skylights overhead, falling on five armchairs, which are lined up against the wall. This is an illusion, of course – the blue sky and brilliant sun are nothing more than coloured plastic and a very bright light – but the effect is exhilarating nonetheless. I could be sitting on a sun lounger at midday; the only thing missing is the heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I’d interviewed her seven hours earlier, with the help of an interpreter, Angelina’s face had remained expressionless as she’d replied. Now, at 3.20am, she is smiling, and even beginning to initiate a conversation with me in English, which she’d claimed not to speak. By dawn, Angelina’s telling me about the family history she’s started writing, which she’d like to pick up again, and inviting me to stay with her in Sicily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could something as simple as staying awake overnight bring about such a transformation? Unpicking the mechanism isn’t straightforward: we still don’t fully understand the nature of depression or the function of sleep, both of which involve multiple areas of the brain. But recent studies have started to yield some insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brain activity of people with depression looks different during sleep and wakefulness than that of healthy people. During the day, wake-promoting signals coming from the circadian system – our internal 24-hour biological clock – are thought to help us resist sleep, with these signals being replaced by sleep-promoting ones at night. Our brain cells work in cycles too, becoming increasingly excitable in response to stimuli during wakefulness, with this excitability dissipating when we sleep. But in people with depression and bipolar disorder, these fluctuations appear dampened or absent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression is also associated with altered daily rhythms of hormone secretion and body temperature, and the more severe the illness, the greater the degree of disruption. Like the sleep signals, these rhythms are also driven by the body’s circadian system, which itself is driven by a set of interacting proteins, encoded by ‘clock genes’ that are expressed in a rhythmic pattern throughout the day. They drive hundreds of different cellular processes, enabling them to keep time with one another and turn on and off. A circadian clock ticks in every cell of your body, including your brain cells, and they are coordinated by an area of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which responds to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When people are seriously depressed, their circadian rhythms tend to be very flat; they don’t get the usual response of melatonin rising in the evening, and the cortisol levels are consistently high rather than falling in the evening and the night,” says Steinn Steingrimsson, a psychiatrist at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, Sweden, who is currently running a trial of wake therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recovery from depression is associated with a normalisation of these cycles. “I think depression may be one of the consequences of this basic flattening of circadian rhythms and homeostasis in the brain,” says Benedetti. “When we sleep-deprive depressed people, we restore this cyclical process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how does this restoration come about? One possibility is that depressed people simply need added sleep pressure to jump-start a sluggish system. Sleep pressure – our urge to sleep – is thought to arise because of the gradual release of adenosine in the brain. It builds up throughout the day and attaches to adenosine receptors on neurons, making us feel drowsy. Drugs that trigger these receptors have the same effect, whereas drugs that block them – such as caffeine – make us feel more awake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate whether this process might underpin the antidepressant effects of prolonged wakefulness, researchers at Tufts University in Massachusetts took mice with depression-like symptoms and administered high doses of a compound that triggers adenosine receptors, mimicking what happens during sleep deprivation. After 12 hours, the mice had improved, measured by how long they spent trying to escape when forced to swim or when suspended by their tails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also know sleep deprivation does other things to the depressed brain. It prompts changes in the balance of neurotransmitters in areas that help to regulate mood, and it restores normal activity in emotion-processing areas of the brain, strengthening connections between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as Benedetti and his team discovered, if wake therapy kick-starts a sluggish circadian rhythm, lithium and light therapy seem to help maintain it. Lithium has been used as a mood stabiliser for years without anyone really understanding how it works, but we know it boosts the expression of a protein, called Per2, that drives the molecular clock in cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bright light, meanwhile, is known to alter the rhythms of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, as well as boosting activity in emotion-processing areas of the brain more directly. Indeed, the American Psychiatric Association states that light therapy is as effective as most antidepressants in treating non-seasonal depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;article__section article__section--default&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph paragraph--text&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spite of its promising results against bipolar disorder, wake therapy has been slow to catch on in other countries. “You could be cynical and say it’s because you can’t patent it,” says David Veale, a consultant psychiatrist at the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, Benedetti has never been offered pharmaceutical funding to carry out his trials of chronotherapy. Instead, he has – until recently – been reliant on government funding, which is often in short supply. His current research is being funded by the EU. Had he followed the conventional route of accepting industry money to run drug trials with his patients, he quips, he probably wouldn’t be living in a two-bedroom apartment and driving a 1998 Honda Civic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bias towards pharmaceutical solutions has kept chronotherapy below the radar for many psychiatrists. “A lot of people just don’t know about it,” says Veale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also difficult to find a suitable placebo for sleep deprivation or bright light exposure, which means that large, randomised placebo-controlled trials of chronotherapy haven’t been done. Because of this, there’s some scepticism about how well it really works. “While there is increasing interest, I don’t think many treatments based on this approach are yet routinely used – the evidence needs to be better and there are some practical difficulties in implementing things like sleep deprivation,” says John Geddes, a professor of epidemiological psychiatry at the University of Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, interest in the processes underpinning chronotherapy is beginning to spread. “Insights into the biology of sleep and circadian systems are now providing promising targets for treatment development,” says Geddes. “It goes beyond pharmaceuticals – targeting sleep with psychological treatments might also help or even prevent mental disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the UK, the USA, Denmark and Sweden, psychiatrists are investigating chronotherapy as a treatment for general depression. “A lot of the studies that have been done so far have been very small,” says Veale, who is currently planning a feasibility study at Maudsley Hospital in London. “We need to demonstrate that it is feasible and that people can adhere to it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, what studies there have been have produced mixed results. Klaus Martiny, who researches non-drug methods for treating depression at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, has published two trials looking at the effects of sleep deprivation, together with daily morning bright light and regular bedtimes, on general depression. In the first study, 75 patients were given the antidepressant duloxetine, in combination with either chronotherapy or daily exercise. After the first week, 41 per cent of the chronotherapy group had experienced a halving of their symptoms, compared to 13 per cent of the exercise group. And at 29 weeks, 62 per cent of the wake therapy patients were symptom-free, compared to 38 per cent of those in the exercise group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Martiny’s second study, severely depressed hospital inpatients who had failed to respond to antidepressant drugs were offered the same chronotherapy package as an add-on to the drugs and psychotherapy they were undergoing. After one week, those in the chronotherapy group improved significantly more than the group receiving standard treatment, although in subsequent weeks the control group caught up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one has yet compared wake therapy head-to-head with antidepressants; neither has it been tested against bright light therapy and lithium alone. But even if it’s only effective for a minority, many people with depression – and indeed psychiatrists – may find the idea of a drug-free treatment attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m a pill pusher for a living, and it still appeals to me to do something that doesn’t involve pills,” says Jonathan Stewart, a professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia University in New York, who is currently running a wake therapy trial at New York State Psychiatric Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Benedetti, Stewart only keeps patients awake for one night: “I couldn’t see a lot of people agreeing to stay in hospital for three nights, and it also requires a lot of nursing and resources,” he says. Instead, he uses something called sleep phase advance, where on the days after a night of sleep deprivation, the time the patient goes to sleep and wakes up is systematically brought forward. So far, Stewart has treated around 20 patients with this protocol, and 12 have shown a response – most of them during the first week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may also work as a prophylactic: recent studies suggest that teenagers whose parents set – and manage to enforce – earlier bedtimes are less at risk of depression and suicidal thinking. Like light therapy and sleep deprivation, the precise mechanism is unclear, but researchers suspect a closer fit between sleep time and the natural light–dark cycle is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sleep phase advance has so far failed to hit the mainstream. And, Stewart accepts, it’s not for everybody. “For those for whom it works, it’s a miracle cure. But just as Prozac doesn’t get everyone better who takes it, neither does this,” he says. “My problem is that I have no idea ahead of time who it’s going to help.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;article__section article__section--default&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph paragraph--text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression can strike anyone, but there’s mounting evidence that genetic variations can disrupt the circadian system to make certain people more vulnerable. Several clock gene variations have been associated with an elevated risk of developing mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stress can then compound the problem. Our response to it is largely mediated through the hormone cortisol, which is under strong circadian control, but cortisol itself also directly influences the timing of our circadian clocks. So if you have a weak clock, the added burden of stress could be enough to tip your system over the edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, you can trigger depressive symptoms in mice by repeatedly exposing them to a noxious stimulus, such as an electric shock, from which they can’t escape – a phenomenon called learned helplessness. In the face of this ongoing stress, the animals eventually just give up and exhibit depression-like behaviours. When David Welsh, a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Diego, analysed the brains of mice that had depressive symptoms, he found disrupted circadian rhythms in two critical areas of the brain’s reward circuit – a system that’s strongly implicated in depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Welsh has also shown that a disturbed circadian system itself can cause depression-like symptoms. When he took healthy mice and knocked out a key clock gene in the brain’s master clock, they looked just like the depressed mice he’d been studying earlier. “They don’t need to learn to be helpless, they are already helpless,” Welsh says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if disrupted circadian rhythms are a likely cause of depression, what can be done to prevent rather than treat them? Is it possible to strengthen your circadian clock to increase psychological resilience, rather than remedy depressive symptoms by forgoing sleep?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martiny thinks so. He is currently testing whether keeping a more regular daily schedule could prevent his depressed inpatients from relapsing once they’ve recovered and are released from the psychiatric ward. “That’s when the trouble usually comes,” he says. “Once they’re discharged their depression gets worse again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter is a 45-year-old care assistant from Copenhagen who has battled with depression since his early teens. Like Angelina and many others with depression, his first episode followed a period of intense stress and upheaval. His sister, who more or less brought him up, left home when he was 13, leaving him with an uninterested mother and a father who also suffered from severe depression. Soon after that, his father died of cancer – another shock, as he’d kept his prognosis hidden until the week before his death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter’s depression has seen him hospitalised six times, including for a month last April. “In some ways being in hospital is a relief,” he says. However, he feels guilty about the effect it has on his sons, aged seven and nine. “My youngest boy said he cried every night I was in hospital, because I wasn’t there to hug him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when Martiny told Peter about the study he had just started recruiting for, he readily agreed to participate. Dubbed ‘circadian-reinforcement therapy’, the idea is to strengthen people’s circadian rhythms by encouraging regularity in their sleep, wake, meal and exercise times, and pushing them to spend more time outdoors, exposed to daylight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For four weeks after leaving the psychiatric ward in May, Peter wore a device that tracked his activity and sleep, and he completed regular mood questionnaires. If there was any deviation in his routine, he would receive a phone call to find out what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I meet Peter, we joke about the tan lines around his eyes; obviously, he’s been taking the advice seriously. He laughs: “Yes, I’m getting outdoors to the park, and if it’s nice weather, I take my children to the beach, for walks, or to the playground, because then I will get some light, and that improves my mood.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those aren’t the only changes he’s made. He now gets up at 6 every morning to help his wife with the children. Even if he’s not hungry he eats breakfast: typically, yoghurt with muesli. He doesn’t take naps and tries to be in bed by 10pm. If Peter does wake up at night, he practises mindfulness – a technique he picked up in hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martiny pulls up Peter’s data on his computer. It confirms the shift towards earlier sleep and wake times, and shows an improvement in the quality of his sleep, which is mirrored by his mood scores. Immediately after his release from hospital, these averaged around 6 out of 10. But after two weeks they’d risen to consistent 8s or 9s, and one day, he even managed a 10. At the beginning of June, he returned to his job at the care home, where he works 35 hours a week. “Having a routine has really helped me,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, Martiny has recruited 20 patients to his trial, but his target is 120; it’s therefore too soon to know how many will respond the same way as Peter, or indeed, if his psychological health will be maintained. Even so, there’s mounting evidence that good sleep routine can help our mental wellbeing. According to a study published in &lt;em&gt;Lancet Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; in September 2017 – the largest randomised trial of a psychological intervention to date – insomniacs who underwent a ten-week course of cognitive behavioural therapy to address their sleep problems showed sustained reductions in paranoia and hallucinatory experiences as a result. They also experienced improvements in symptoms of depression and anxiety, fewer nightmares, better psychological wellbeing and day-to-day functioning, and they were less likely to experience a depressive episode or anxiety disorder during the course of the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep, routine and daylight. It’s a simple formula, and easy to take for granted. But imagine if it really could reduce the incidence of depression and help people to recover from it more quickly. Not only would it improve the quality of countless lives, it would save health systems money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of wake therapy, Benedetti cautions that it isn’t something people should try to administer to themselves at home. Particularly for anyone who has bipolar disorder, there’s a risk of it triggering a switch into mania – although in his experience, the risk is smaller than that posed by taking antidepressants. Keeping yourself awake overnight is also difficult, and some patients temporarily slip back into depression or enter a mixed mood state, which can be dangerous. “I want to be there to speak about it to them when it happens,” Benedetti says. Mixed states often precede suicide attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week after spending the night awake with Angelina, I call Benedetti to check her progress. He tells me that after the third sleep deprivation, she experienced a full remission in her symptoms and returned to Sicily with her husband. That week, they were due to be marking their 50th wedding anniversary. When I’d asked her if she thought her husband would notice any change in her symptoms, she’d said she hoped he’d notice the change in her physical appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope. After she has spent more than half her life without it, I suspect its return is the most precious golden anniversary gift of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;1677&quot; id=&quot;1677&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;First, there was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kslaw.com/people/george-morris&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.kslaw.com/people/george-morris&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the attorney&lt;/a&gt; himself, a face I recognized from his bio online. He was in a suit, with a leather briefcase, looking very lawyer-like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;03f1&quot; id=&quot;03f1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Second, there was in-house legal counsel from Equifax, who played a supporting and advisory role to the actual litigation counsel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b02a&quot; id=&quot;b02a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Third, there was a Vice President in the legal department of Equifax, who specialized in analyzing credit reports, and could testify specifically to my record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7985&quot; id=&quot;7985&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The judge was again, a judge pro tem, which means she was an attorney who had been appointed judge for the day. Technically in an appeal of a small claims court judgment, you’re allowed to have a Superior Court judge hear the trial. Equifax’s attorney made sure the judge pro tem knew that she wasn’t wanted there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9d23&quot; id=&quot;9d23&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;“You’ll follow the rules and procedures, right?” he demanded, before signing the stipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fd32&quot; id=&quot;fd32&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The judge, a lady with all white hair, nodded mildly. “Yes, I follow all the rules of evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;208b&quot; id=&quot;208b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;All three of them sat at the Defendants’ table, and I sat alone at my Plaintiff’s table. I presented my case, for the second time, and brought plenty of evidence to back myself up, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/news-coverage/salon-elizabeth-warren-equifax-might-profit-off-its-data-breach&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/news-coverage/salon-elizabeth-warren-equifax-might-profit-off-its-data-breach&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; done by Senator Elizabeth Warren’s office with aid from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which described in detail how Equifax actually may profit from its negligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c799&quot; id=&quot;c799&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This time, Equifax was not going to let me off so easy. Before I had even distributed the report, Equifax’s lawyer shook his head vehemently. “How is this evidence even permissible?” he asked, gesturing to my report. “It’s hearsay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4d96&quot; id=&quot;4d96&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I had read up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/4th/17/1128.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/4th/17/1128.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;my caselaw.&lt;/a&gt; “Hearsay is permissible in small claims court.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0480&quot; id=&quot;0480&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;“Show me the case. Do you have the case?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5136&quot; id=&quot;5136&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I did not have the case. I had the case name (Houghtaling v. Superior Court), but I did not have the case. The lawyer looked smug. The judge looked on mildly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7dc3&quot; id=&quot;7dc3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;It was going to be a long hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Cleaning sprays have an impact on lung health comparable to cigarettes</title>
<link>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/cleaning-products-lungs-damage-cigarettes-smoking-20-day-scientists-warning-a8214051.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/cleaning-products-lungs-damage-cigarettes-smoking-20-day-scientists-warning-a8214051.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Regular use of cleaning sprays has an impact on lung health comparable with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Smoking&quot;&gt;smoking&lt;/a&gt; a pack of cigarettes every day, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research followed more than 6,000 people over a 20 year period and found women in particular suffered significant health problems after long-term use of these products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung function decline in women working as cleaners or regularly using cleaning products at home was comparable to smoking 20 cigarettes a day over 10 to 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientists who carried out the study advised that such products should be avoided and can normally be replaced with simple microfibre cloths and water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;While the short-term effects of cleaning chemicals on asthma are becoming increasingly well documented, we lack knowledge of the long-term impact,&quot; said Professor Cecile Svanes, a medic at the University of Bergen and the senior author of the study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We feared that such chemicals, by steadily causing a little damage to the airways day after day, year after year, might accelerate the rate of lung function decline that occurs with age.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thoracic.org/about/newsroom/press-releases/resources/women-cleaners-lung-function.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published in&lt;/a&gt; the American Thoracic Society's American &lt;em&gt;Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-video&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;scayt-misspell-word&quot; data-scayt-lang=&quot;en_GB&quot; data-scayt-word=&quot;Microbeads&quot;&gt;Microbeads&lt;/span&gt; ban: Government to outlaw &lt;span class=&quot;scayt-misspell-word&quot; data-scayt-lang=&quot;en_GB&quot; data-scayt-word=&quot;microplastics&quot;&gt;microplastics&lt;/span&gt; in cosmetic products&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung function was measured by testing how much air the participants could forcibly breathe out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was then compared to the answers from a questionnaire given to everyone in the study to gauge their level of cleaning activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that the amount of air breathed out by their participants decreased more in women who regularly cleaned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study did not find any harmful effects comparable to those seen in women in the men they studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-gallery&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;gallery-title&quot;&gt;Science news in pictures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the scientists noted their work did have some limitations, and the number of men exposed to cleaning products on the scale of women in the study was small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the results appear dramatic, the researchers speculated chemicals in cleaning products irritate the fragile mucous membranes lining the lungs, which over time leads to lasting damage and “remodelling” of the airways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When you think of inhaling small particles from cleaning agents that are meant for cleaning the floor and not your lungs, maybe it is not so surprising after all,&quot; said Øistein Svanes , a doctoral student who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;dnd-caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;Sugary drinks and unhealthy snacks 'fuelling obesity epidemic among children'&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The take home message of this study is that in the long run cleaning chemicals very likely cause rather substantial damage to your lungs,&quot; she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;These chemicals are usually unnecessary; microfibre cloths and water are more than enough for most purposes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;This Is What Broadband Satellite Communication Looked Like in 1965&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 12 January, a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) rocket blasted off from India’s eastern coast. While its primary cargo was a large Indian mapping satellite, dozens of secondary CubeSats from other countries travelled along with it. Seattle-based Planetary Resources supplied a spacecraft that will test prospecting tools for future asteroid miners, Canadian company Telesat launched a broadband communications satellite, and a British Earth-observation mission called Carbonite will capture high-definition video of the planet’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zoom&quot; href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzAzMDEzNA.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;ISRO's list of satellite's aboard the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) rocket.&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzAzMDEzNA.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;magnifier&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This list from ISRO describes the satellites that were on board the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket.
&lt;p&gt;Also on board were four small satellites that probably should not have been there. SpaceBee-1, 2, 3, and 4 were briefly described by the Indian space agency ISRO as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isro.gov.in/sites/default/files/flipping_book/PSLV-C40_Cartosat2SeriesMission/files/assets/common/downloads/PSLV-C40%20-%20Cartosat%202%20Series%20Mission.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;two-way satellite communications and data relay&lt;/a&gt;” devices from the United States. No operator was specified, and only ISRO publicly noted that they successfully reached orbit the same day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IEEE Spectrum&lt;/em&gt; can reveal that the SpaceBees are almost certainly the first spacecraft from a Silicon Valley startup called Swarm Technologies, currently still in stealth mode. Swarm was founded in 2016 by one engineer who developed a spacecraft concept for Google and another who sold his previous company to Apple. The SpaceBees were built as technology demonstrators for a new space-based Internet of Things communications network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swarm believes its network could enable satellite communications for orders of magnitude less cost than existing options. It envisages the worldwide tracking of ships and cars, new agricultural technologies, and low cost connectivity for humanitarian efforts anywhere in the world. The four SpaceBees would be the first practical demonstration of Swarm’s prototype hardware and cutting-edge algorithms, swapping data with ground stations for up to eight years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem is, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.fcc.gov/els/GetAtt.html?id=203152&amp;amp;x=.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dismissed Swarm’s application&lt;/a&gt; for its experimental satellites a month earlier, on safety grounds. The FCC is responsible for regulating commercial satellites, including minimizing the chance of accidents in space. It feared that the four SpaceBees now orbiting the Earth would pose an unacceptable collision risk for other spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If confirmed, this would be the first ever unauthorized launch of commercial satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the FCC sent Swarm &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.fcc.gov/els/GetAtt.html?id=205987&amp;amp;x=.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a letter revoking its authorization for a follow-up mission&lt;/a&gt; with four more satellites, due to launch next month. A pending application for a large market trial of Swarm’s system with two Fortune 100 companies could also be in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the FCC told the startup that the agency would assess “the impact of the applicant’s apparent unauthorized launch and operation of four satellites… on its qualifications to be a Commission licensee.” If Swarm cannot convince the FCC otherwise, the startup could lose permission to build its revolutionary network before the wider world even knows the company exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unauthorized launch would also call into question the ability of secondary satellite ‘ride-share’ companies and foreign launch providers to comply with U.S. space regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swarm Technologies, based in Menlo Park, Calif., is the brainchild of two talented young aerospace engineers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://saraspangelo.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sara Spangelo&lt;/a&gt;, its CEO, is a Canadian who worked at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, before moving to Google in 2016. Spangelo’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/astronauts/recruitment/profiles.asp?spangelo-sara&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;astronaut candidate profile&lt;/a&gt; at the Canadian Space Agency says that while at Google, she led a team developing a spacecraft concept for its moonshot X division, including both technical and market analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inlay pullquote rt med&quot;&gt;If confirmed, this would be the first ever unauthorized launch of commercial satellites.&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Parent company Alphabet told &lt;em&gt;Spectrum&lt;/em&gt; that X, which is now a separate company from Google, explores and kills hundreds of ideas each year, and that Spangelo’s work had nothing to do with Google’s recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/energy/renewables/is-google-going-underground-with-hypersonic-tech&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hypersonics research with NASA&lt;/a&gt;, revealed in &lt;em&gt;Spectrum&lt;/em&gt; earlier this week).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swarm CFO Benjamin Longmier has an equally impressive resume. In 2015, he sold his near-space balloon company Aether Industries to Apple, before taking a teaching post at the University of Michigan. He is also co-founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://apollofusion.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Apollo Fusion&lt;/a&gt;, a company producing an innovative electric propulsion system for satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Diagram from Swarm Technologies FCC filing.&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzAzMDA2Mw.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Image: Swarm Technologies This illustration from a March 2018 FCC filing by Swarm Technologies shows the proposed network architecture for the startup’s IoT satellites.
&lt;p&gt;The idea of Swarm’s networks is deceptively simple. Any future Internet of Things (IoT) will require pervasive connectivity for billions of trackers and sensors to exchange data over the Internet. However, there are only sporadic wireless networks in many rural and undeveloped areas, and none at all at sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swarm would provide solar-powered gateways that would collect data from nearby IoT devices using Bluetooth, LoRa, or Wi-Fi, then beam them up to an orbiting SpaceBee using VHF radio. When the SpaceBee passed over a ground station that was connected to the Internet, it would beam the data down again, and on to its end user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is encrypted in both directions and each SpaceBee would transmit only about once a minute, accepting uplinks or initiating downlinks depending on which devices were below. While she was a graduate student at the University of Michigan, Spangelo wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/1.I010086&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305054814002809&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt; describing models and algorithms to maximize the data flow over just such a network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its application for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1647553&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Science Foundation (NSF) grant&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, Swarm said that its integrated sensor and data relay platforms were less than 1/10,000 the mass and power, and 400 times cheaper, than those in existing satellite systems like Iridium. The NSF has awarded Swarm over US $220,000 to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April of last year, Swarm filed its &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.fcc.gov/els/GetAtt.html?id=191177&amp;amp;x=.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;first application&lt;/a&gt; with the FCC for a test fleet of four satellites called BEEs, standing for Basic Electronic Elements, and two ground stations. Each satellite would be just 10 centimeters (cm) x 10 cm x 2.8 cm tall—about one quarter the size of a standard 10 cm cube, or 1U, CubeSat. The four would be launched from an Indian PSLV rocket stacked together, then spring open in space to enter diverging orbits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This four-for-the-price-of-one deal would keep launch fees low, and Swarm’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.swarm-technologies.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;minimal website&lt;/a&gt; proudly claims that it’s building “the world’s smallest two-way communications satellites.” However, miniaturizing the technology would come at a cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As an object gets below 1U in size, it gets difficult to track, which means it’s harder to predict if there’s going to be a conjunction with another satellite,” says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ae.gatech.edu/people/marcus-j-holzinger&quot;&gt;Marcus Holzinger&lt;/a&gt;, an aerospace professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology and expert on orbital safety. “Anything that size impacting at orbital velocities can be catastrophic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swarm Technologies had realized that the small size of its BEEs might be a problem. It installed a GPS device in each satellite that would broadcast its position when requested. It also covered each of the satellite’s four smallest faces with an experimental passive radar reflector developed by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.public.navy.mil/spawar/Pages/default.aspx&quot;&gt;U.S. Navy’s Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command&lt;/a&gt;. According to Swarm’s FCC application, this would increase the BEE’s radar profile by a factor of 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the FCC was not buying it. After correspondence back and forth through the summer, the FCC sent Swarm a letter in early December. In it, Anthony Serafini, chief of the FCC’s Experimental Licensing Branch, noted that the radar reflector only operated in a certain frequency band, corresponding to “a small portion” of America’s ground-based Space Surveillance Network. He also worried that GPS data would only be available while the satellite was functional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holzinger shares the agency’s concerns. “If there’s a software glitch, the satellite is going to become a passive piece of debris,” he says. “And while the reflector is certainly more robust, it may not amplify radar from a sensor using [a different] frequency band.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serafini wrote: “In the absence of tracking at the same level as available for [1U] objects… the ability of operational spacecraft to reliably assess the need for and plan effective collision avoidance maneuvers will be reduced or eliminated. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that a grant of this application is in the public interest.” The FCC had dismissed Swarm’s application, and that should have been the end of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inlay pullquote lt med&quot;&gt;“If there’s a software glitch, the satellite is going to become a passive piece of debris.” &lt;span class=&quot;pq-attrib&quot;&gt;—Marcus Holzinger, Georgia Institute of Technology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swarm apparently moved swiftly on. In January 2018, the company filed &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.fcc.gov/els/GetAtt.html?id=203073&amp;amp;x=.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an application for four new satellites&lt;/a&gt;, this time with a larger, more conventional 1U design. Since its application the previous April, Swarm wrote that it had lined up two (unnamed) Fortune 100 companies for paid pilot programs, with 15 additional companies in agriculture, shipping, and other markets watching closely. The U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, and U.S. Special Operations Command has also expressed interest in using Swarm’s network for “tracking and geo-locating a large number of items on the ground and at sea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swarm’s new plan would be to send the four larger satellites on a Rocket Lab launch from New Zealand in April. Rocket Lab’s Electron had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rocketlabusa.com/news/updates/rocket-lab-successfully-reaches-orbit-and-deploys-payloads-january-21-2018/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;just delivered its first payload to orbit&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the latest vehicle offering low-cost satellite launches. This time, Swarm’s application sailed through the FCC in a matter of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Swarm shared details of its two market trials in &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.fcc.gov/els/GetAtt.html?id=205846&amp;amp;x=.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;yet another FCC application&lt;/a&gt;. It now wants permission to install two more downlink ground stations and up to 500 uplink gateways around the United States, for the next year. Swarm wrote that it has been in touch with more than 125 potential end users, had received a second NSF grant to provide cheap connectivity for humanitarian efforts, and announced a partnership with NASA’s Ames Research Center. Everything was looking up for the young company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That all changed on Wednesday morning, with an email from Serafini to Spangelo setting aside permission for April’s Rocket Lab mission. The FCC believes that Swarm launched and is operating its original small satellites, despite having been forbidden to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Comparison of the rendering of a BEE with deployed antenna from a 2017 document with an ISRO image of a SpaceBEE satellite.&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzAzMDA0MQ.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Images: Top: ISRO; Bottom: Swarm Technologies Below, a rendering from a 2017 FCC document filed by Swarm Technologies shows a BEE with its antenna deployed. Above, is an image from ISRO of a SpaceBEE satellite.
&lt;p&gt;The FCC declined requests for an interview or comment, but the evidence for the January PSLV’s mysterious SpaceBees being Swarm’s BEE satellites is overwhelming. Swarm’s April 2017 application notes the satellites were due to launch on the very same PSLV mission, and refers to the devices as “Space BEEs” at several points. Websites dedicated to tracking operational satellites show the SpaceBees in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.n2yo.com/database/?name=spacebee#results&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;orbits virtually identical&lt;/a&gt; to those specified in Swarm’s application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swarm did not respond to multiple requests from &lt;em&gt;Spectrum&lt;/em&gt;, with any details about its activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One serious question is how Swarm was able to launch its satellites without FCC authorization. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenny-barna-670aab4&quot;&gt;Jenny Barna&lt;/a&gt;, director of launch for Spire Global, a satellite data company with more than 50 CubeSats in orbit, says, “If you’re a secondary passenger, you typically have to produce evidence of a license before you integrate.” Integration is the process of organizing a rocket’s payload of satellites for launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle's heat shield being closed, with the 31 satellites on view.&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzAzMDA2NA.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Photo: ISRO The heat shield closes on the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, which is carrying 31 satellites.
&lt;p&gt;However, Barna admits that getting a license when you are hitching a ride with a larger satellite can be tricky. “The process is onerous by the nature of regulatory work, made worse by the fact that it’s not set up for the way that secondary customers get launches,” she says. “The Silicon Valley way of doing things is technically pretty iterative. You might not be quite sure what frequencies you will land on... or where your ride is going to come from. We’ve had satellites on the launch pad before the FCC approves it, and then they approve it at the last second.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.fcc.gov/els/GetAtt.html?id=193219&amp;amp;x=.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Paperwork&lt;/a&gt; filed with the FCC by Swarm Technologies shows that it was planning to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://spaceflight.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Spaceflight&lt;/a&gt;, a Seattle-based launch services company, to get its satellites on board the PSLV. Spaceflight’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://spaceflight.com/services/launch-services/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; shows that it did in fact supply 19 of the 31 satellites for January’s PSLV launch, including some with the SpaceBees unique 0.25U dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Spaceflight senior mission manager Adam Hadaller &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/aerospace/satellites/the-tricks-to-launching-many-satellites-on-one-rocket&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Spectrum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it checked all its customers’ safety regulations and communication licenses before launch. However, in response to questions this week, Spaceflight would only say: “Spaceflight has never knowingly launched a customer who has been denied an FCC license. It is the responsibility of our customers to secure all FCC licenses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Spaceflight nor ISRO could immediately confirm whether they routinely check launch customers’ FCC licenses. If they do not, there would seem to be little to stop satellite makers from deploying any device they choose into orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, future spacecraft and astronauts will now have to deal with four difficult-to-see satellites, each the size of hardback books, whizzing around the planet. “Even at that size, you’re talking about a substantial energy transfer should they hit something,” says Holzinger. “In most cases it would be an explosive break-up, where all the pieces fly away from each other very quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it waits to hear the FCC’s decision on future SpaceBee missions, Swarm Technologies will surely be hoping to avoid a similar fate down here on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Jupiter is deep</title>
<link>http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/whoa-like-jupiter-is-deep-really-really-deep</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/whoa-like-jupiter-is-deep-really-really-deep</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Scientists studying Jupiter using data and observations from the Juno spacecraft &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasa-juno-findings-jupiter-s-jet-streams-are-unearthly&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;just released four new papers on their results&lt;/a&gt;, and I honestly can't say what's cooler: the science, or the jaw-dropping images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research deals with Jupiter's atmosphere. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwn8fQSW7-8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jupiter is a gas giant&lt;/a&gt;, and when we see it we're not looking at a surface at all, just the tops of its clouds. And even that is complicated, because the clouds are at all different heights. In some spots we see high-altitude clouds (sometimes shiny white due to ammonia ice that's frozen out as the gas rises) and in some spots we see hundreds of kilometers deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's peanuts; Jupiter is 130,000 kilometers across! So we're really not seeing very far into it. That's why &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/main/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;NASA sent the Juno spacecraft&lt;/a&gt; there. It uses a suite of instruments to analyze Jupiter's atmosphere, allowing scientists to gain an understanding of what's happening underneath the cloud tops. Not only that, but they put the probe on a polar orbit, meaning that instead of going around the planet's equator, the orbit is tilted nearly 90°, so it passes over both poles once per orbit. The orbit is also highly elliptical, so elongated that Juno goes out about 8 million kilometers from Jupiter, then swings back and dives to just 4,000 km over the north pole!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data being returned &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/magnificent-chaos-reigns-at-jupiters-poles&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;is unprecedented&lt;/a&gt;. And what scientists are learning is… well, weird. As expected. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/we-knew-jupiter-was-weird-now-were-finding-out-how-weird&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jupiter is a weird place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And by weird, I mean holy-crap-what-the-heck-is-going-on-there?! weird. Behold, Jupiter's north pole!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll admit, when I first saw this image, it gave me the willies. There's something downright unsettling about it. But once I got past that, and really looked at it, that's when I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; got the willies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image is a composite of several images taken using the Jupiter InfraRed Auroral Mapper, which can detect light in the thermal infrared. That means warmer gas is brighter, and cooler darker. The warmest gas in these images is about -10° C, and the coolest about -80°.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That dark (cool) swirl is the Northern Polar Cyclone (or NPC), a vortex about 4,000 kilometers across — that's the distance from Los Angeles to New York City! It's surrounded by cool gas, and around that is an entirely bizarre string of eight cyclones, all about the same size. At first I thought they formed an octagon, but a better description is two overlapping and rotated squares, each square made by connecting every other cyclone around the pole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with the one in the lower left (let’s call it cyclone 1): See how it looks smoother, slightly bigger, and more organized than the ones on either side of it? Once you see that, you'll see that cyclones 3, 5, and 7 are similar, and that 2, 4, 6, and 8 are less organized, rougher. It turns out the two overlapping patterns are different in other ways; for example, the centers of the odd ones are at a latitude of 82.5, and the even ones a bit farther north at 83.3° — a difference of nearly 1,000 km!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Well, yeah, that's a good question, and no one knows. It's common in planetary atmospheres to get cyclones near the poles; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/the-beta-effect.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a complicated byproduct&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/pressure-living-spinning-planet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Coriolis effect&lt;/a&gt; pushes them poleward. But in most planets the cyclones merge when they get close, or dissipate. However, this octet of them (nonet if you include the NPC) was seen in the earliest Juno images and have persisted for at least seven months, far longer than you'd expect. They may even be older, since we don't know how long they were there before Juno arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturn, a similar effect created and sustains the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/summer-comes-saturn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;oh-so-very-cool hexagonal pattern at its north pole&lt;/a&gt;. Why this hasn't happened on Jupiter is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also weirdly, the south pole of Jupiter is different:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a single Southern Polar Cyclone (the SPC in this case), but only five cyclones around it! They're bigger too, and are different sizes, ranging from 5,600 to 7,000 km across. Again, it's not clear why the poles are different. The fact that there are fewer in the south and they're bigger may be related (I'm guessing, but if you have fewer they can grow to fill more space … ?), but no one really knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only have these features persisted for months, but during that time no new features appeared either. There's a lot more stability here than expected, and no one is sure why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weirdness extends to lower latitudes as well. I love this part, so bear with me. If Jupiter were a solid ball, it would rotate rigidly. But it's not; the atmosphere goes down quite a ways until the pressure squeezes it into something resembling a liquid, and then deeper down there may be a solid core. If you spin a spherical fluid and let it settle down into stable patterns, you get a predictable rotation to it versus depth. Any deviations from this are likely due to wind patterns taking cold, dense air deeper into the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface we see these wind patterns as the bright zones and dark belts stretching across it. But what happens deeper down? How far does the wind carry them into the planet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;media-container media-container--view-mode--syfy-wire-blog-video-full-size media-container--type--video&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;media-youtube-video media-element file-syfy-wire-blog-video-full-size media-youtube-1&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;media-youtube-player&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; title=&quot;Crash Course Astronomy: Jupiter&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/Xwn8fQSW7-8?wmode=opaque&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;Video of Crash Course Astronomy: Jupiter&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that even though this happens far below the clouds, this can be measured! Denser layers will have slightly more gravity than less dense ones, and as Juno swings by close to the planet this variation in gravity is detectable as changes in its velocity. It's a small effect, sure, but detectable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found a few things. One is that the changes in gravity, and therefore density, are latitude-dependent and correlate strongly with the banding we see at the tops of the clouds. Given it's wind that changes the deep density and also sculpts those bands, that's not too surprising. Weirdly (that word gets used a lot with Jupiter) there's a north/south asymmetry; the two hemispheres have unequal distribution of mass. Why? Yeah, you guessed it: No one's sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, by comparing what they expect from just fluid rotation to what they measure with Juno, scientists can map how far down the winds carry these banded surface structures: about 3,000 kilometers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yegads. That's a long way. Jupiter's atmosphere is deep. At that depth, the winds and banding we see on the surface give way to more homogeneous structure, and under that Jupiter rotates nearly like a rigid ball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientists studying this think that at that 3,000 km depth, the pressure and heat are so huge that the gas becomes a plasma, ionized, where the atoms of the gas have their electrons stripped from them. That means the plasma is electrically charged. When you move a charged gas &lt;a href=&quot;https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/65335/how-do-moving-charges-produce-magnetic-fields&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;it creates a magnetic field&lt;/a&gt;, so right around that depth there's a lot of magnetism. If one layer of gas is moving faster than another, their magnetic fields will interact and create drag, smoothing out their different speeds. Above that depth there's no magnetism to homogenize everything, so we see banding. Below that depth the magnetic fields don't allow any deviations from the bulk motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's amazing. All this from a few flybys of a spacecraft thousands of kilometers above the cloud tops over half a billion kilometers from Earth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;media-container media-container--view-mode--syfy-wire-blog-video-full-size media-container--type--video&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;media-youtube-video media-element file-syfy-wire-blog-video-full-size media-youtube-2&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;media-youtube-player&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; title=&quot;NASA's Juno Spacecraft Reveals the Depth of Jupiter's Colored Bands&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/hF0UjhPSS3A?wmode=opaque&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;Video of NASA&amp;amp;#039;s Juno Spacecraft Reveals the Depth of Jupiter&amp;amp;#039;s Colored Bands&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, that depth means that the atmosphere of Jupiter is equal to about 1% of its total mass. That's a big fraction; the Earth's atmosphere is less than a millionth of our planet’s total mass. And remember, Jupiter is ridiculous huge; even 1% of its mass is more than 3 times Earth's entire mass!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a lot of gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that means a lot of mysteries, many more still to explore. Even with all this, all we've learned about this vast gasball, the Juno mission is only one-third done! There are still years left of observations yet to be made. Some will refine what we already know, honing the measurements already made. But what else is out there, what new things lurk in the 1.4 quadrillion cubic kilometers of weirdness that make up the largest planet in our solar system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're still finding out. Stick around. You'll see.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Getting any Facebook user&amp;#039;s friend list and partial payment card details</title>
<link>https://www.josipfranjkovic.com/blog/facebook-friendlist-paymentcard-leak</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.josipfranjkovic.com/blog/facebook-friendlist-paymentcard-leak</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;Friend list disclosure using persisted GraphQL queries and first-party application client tokens&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Facebook has a GraphQL endpoint which can only be used by some of their own first-party applications. Generally, you need a user (or page) access_token to query the GraphQL endpoint. I have decided to try using Facebook for Android application's &lt;strong&gt;client&lt;/strong&gt; token, but the endpoint returned an error message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighted-code&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
graph.facebook.com/graphql?access_token=350685531728|62f8ce9f74b12f84c123cc23437a4a32&amp;amp;q=me(){id}

Response:
...
    &quot;error_data&quot;: {
      &quot;debug_info&quot;: &quot;Only whitelisted query IDs are allowed in logged out context&quot;
    },
...
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;I did not send a persisted query, but the error shows only whitelisted persisted queries are allowed. Since I collect Facebook's persisted GraphQL queries, I've decided to run a bunch of them to see if any are whitelisted. For example, the query &quot;FBActorNameQuery&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighted-code&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
graph.facebook.com/graphql?access_token=350685531728|62f8ce9f74b12f84c123cc23437&amp;amp;&lt;strong&gt;query_id&lt;/strong&gt;=10154057467378380&amp;amp;query_params={&quot;actorID&quot;:&quot;100….&quot;}

Response:
...
    &quot;error_data&quot;: {
      &quot;debug_info&quot;: &quot;Only whitelisted query IDs are allowed in logged out context&quot;
    },
...
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, I could not find a single whitelisted one - the error was always the same. A couple hours later I remembered another way to send persisted queries, using &lt;span class=&quot;inline-code&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;doc_id&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as the query ID - these did not return the error, but in most cases they returned public data only. While this is a whitelist bypass, it mostly returned data which is already public. However, a query named &quot;&lt;strong&gt;CSPlaygroundGraphQLFriendsQuery&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; leaked the friend list regardless of the privacy settings. Example request and response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighted-code&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Partial payment card details leak using Graph API&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;A bug existed in Facebook's Graph API that allowed querying for any user's payment cards details using a field named &lt;span class=&quot;inline-code&quot;&gt;payment_modules_options&lt;/span&gt;. I found out about this field by intercepting all the requests made by Facebook's Android application during registration and login flow.&lt;br/&gt;Here is an example request:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighted-code&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&amp;amp;fields=payment_modules_options.payment_type(payment_settings)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;inline-code&quot;&gt;USER_ID&lt;/span&gt; is the id of victim's Facebook account, and &lt;span class=&quot;inline-code&quot;&gt;TOKEN&lt;/span&gt; is the attacker's access_token from a first-party Facebook application, like their Android app. The query doesn’t work without a valid &lt;span class=&quot;inline-code&quot;&gt;payment_type&lt;/span&gt;, but specifying an invalid one, &lt;span class=&quot;inline-code&quot;&gt;payment_type(asd)&lt;/span&gt; returned the list of all possible payment types. This is a textbook example of an insecure direct object reference bug (IDOR).&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Martin Shkreli has been sentenced to seven years in prison</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/9/17097116/martin-shkreli-fraud-sentencing-prison</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/9/17097116/martin-shkreli-fraud-sentencing-prison</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;y6lhyi&quot;&gt;Martin Shkreli, who became infamous as the “pharma bro” CEO who massively hiked the price of an anti-parasite treatment, has been sentenced to seven years in prison on fraud charges unrelated to the price increase, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/09/pharma-bro-martin-shkreli-sentenced-to-7-years-in-prison.html&quot;&gt;according to CNBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ZqD6h4&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Shkreli’s defense team requested only about a year of imprisonment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;z0fSpH&quot;&gt;While Shkreli’s defense team argued he should only receive a sentence of about a year, prosecutors had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/03/06/feds-defense-lawyers-battle-over-pharma-bro-martin-shkrelis-recommended-sentence/400386002/&quot;&gt;pushed for at least 15 years&lt;/a&gt;, saying Shkreli had not shown remorse for his actions. A judge announced the sentencing decision at a hearing today, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/allie_conti/status/972163267736031234&quot;&gt;where Shkreli reportedly cried&lt;/a&gt; while pleading for leniency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;QnbJj2&quot;&gt;Shkreli made his first appearance in the public eye in 2015, after the 5,000 percent medication price increase. The decision led to him being scorned &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/martin-shkreli-is-big-pharmas-biggest-ahole&quot;&gt;as “the most hated man in America.”&lt;/a&gt; Often, he seemed to soak in the reputation, memorably smiling as he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/4/10915174/martin-shkreli-smirks-through-house-oversight-hearing-drug-price-hikes&quot;&gt;pleaded the Fifth during a congressional hearing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nyzEOe&quot;&gt;His prison sentence, however, is not tied to those actions. Prosecutors accused Shkreli of lying to investors while he was the CEO of a different pharmaceutical company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Y4OZSn&quot;&gt;Shkreli gained even more public scrutiny after it was revealed that he was the mystery buyer of a one-of-a-kind Wu Tang Clan album. In one more indignity for Shkreli, a judge also ordered this week that the album, along with other valuable possessions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/5/17081476/martin-shkreli-wu-tang-album-auction&quot;&gt;be forfeited to the government&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How Dutch Police Took Over Hansa, a Top Dark Web Market</title>
<link>https://www.wired.com/story/hansa-dutch-police-sting-operation/?retry</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.wired.com/story/hansa-dutch-police-sting-operation/?retry</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;For anyone who&lt;/span&gt; has watched the last few years of cat-and-mouse games on the dark web's black markets, the pattern is familiar: A contraband bazaar like the Silk Road attracts thousands of drug dealers and their customers, along with intense scrutiny from police and three-letter agencies. Authorities hunt down its administrators, and tear the site offline in a dramatic takedown—only to find that its buyers and sellers have simply migrated to the next dark-web market on their list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when Dutch police got onto the trail of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/alphabay-hansa-takedown-dark-web-trap/&quot;&gt;popular dark-web marketplace Hansa&lt;/a&gt; in the fall of 2016, they decided on a different approach: Not a mere takedown, but a takeover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;In interviews with WIRED, ahead of a talk they plan to give at Kaspersky Security Analyst Summit Thursday, two Netherlands National High Tech Crime Unit officers detailed their 10-month investigation into Hansa, once the largest dark-web market in Europe. At its height, Hansa's 3,600 dealers offered more than 24,000 drug product listings, from cocaine to MDMA to heroin, as well as a smaller trade in fraud tools and counterfeit documents. In their probe into that free-trade zone, which would come to be known as Operation Bayonet, the Dutch investigators not only identified the two alleged administrators of Hansa's black market operation in Germany, but went so far as to hijack the two arrested men's accounts to take full control of the site itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inset-left-component paywall inset-left-component--pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;inset-left&quot; class=&quot;inset-left-component__el&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We thought maybe we could really damage the trust in this whole system.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;inset-left&quot; class=&quot;inset-left-component__el&quot;&gt;Marinus Boekelo, NHTCU&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;The NHTCU officers explained how, in the undercover work that followed, they surveilled Hansa's buyers and sellers, discreetly altered the site's code to grab more identifying information of those users, and even tricked dozens of Hansa's anonymous sellers into opening a beacon file on their computers that revealed their locations. The fallout of that law enforcement coup, the officers claim, has been one of the most successful blows against the dark web in its short history: millions of dollars worth of confiscated bitcoins, more than a dozen arrests and counting of the site's top drug dealers, and a vast database of Hansa user information that authorities say should haunt anyone who bought or sold on the site during its last month online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;&quot;When a dark market is taken down, everyone goes to the next one. It's a whack-a-mole effect,&quot; says Marinus Boekelo, one of the NHTCU investigators who worked on the Hansa operation. By secretly seizing control of Hansa rather than merely unplugging it from the internet, Boekelo says he and his Dutch police colleagues aimed not only to uncover more about Hansa's unsuspecting users, but to deal a psychological blow to the broader dark-web drug trade. &quot;We thought maybe we could really damage the trust in this whole system,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;While the Hansa takeover at times involved the close cooperation of American and German law enforcement, neither the US Department of Justice nor the German Federal Criminal Police Office responded to WIRED's requests for comment, leaving some elements of the NHTCU's account without independent confirmation. What follows is the Dutch police's own, candid description of their experience digging into—and ultimately running—one of the world's top online narcotics trafficking operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Pulling Loose Threads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Despite its dramatic turns, the Hansa investigation started in a traditional fashion: with a tip. Security researchers believed they had found a Hansa server in the Netherlands data center of a web-hosting firm. (Security firm BitDefender has claimed &lt;a href=&quot;https://businessinsights.bitdefender.com/bitdefender-europol-fbi-doj-darknet-hansa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;some involvement in the Hansa operation&lt;/a&gt;. But the NHTCU declined to reveal the name of the security company or the web-hosting firm, along with several other details they say they're keeping under wraps to protect methods and sources. Even the names of the two German men charged with running Hansa remain secret, since German law protects the names of prosecuted individuals until their trial.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;As Boekelo tells it, the security firm had somehow found Hansa's development server, a version of the site where it tested new features before deploying them in the live version that handled its formidable load of thousands of visits from drug shoppers every day. While the live Hansa site was protected by Tor, the development server had somehow been exposed online, where the security firm discovered it and recorded its IP address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gert Ras (left) and Marinus Boekelo (right).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite class=&quot;caption-component__credit&quot;&gt;Manuel Velásquez Figueroa&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;The Dutch police quickly contacted the web host, demanded access to its data center, and installed network-monitoring equipment that allowed them to spy on all traffic to and from the machine. They immediately found that the development server also connected to a Tor-protected server at the same location that ran Hansa's live site, as well as a pair of servers in another data center in Germany. They then made a copy of each server's entire drive, including records of every transaction performed in Hansa's history, and every conversation that took place through its anonymized messaging system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Even that massive security breach shouldn't have necessarily exposed any of the site's vendors or administrators, since all of Hansa's visitors and admins used pseudonyms, and sites protected by Tor can only be accessed by users running Tor, too, anonymizing their web connections. But after poring through the contents of the servers, the police found a major operational slip-up: One of the German servers contained the two alleged founders' chat logs on the antiquated messaging protocol IRC. The conversations stretched back years, and amazingly, included both admins' full names and, for one man, his home address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Setting the Trap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Hansa's two suspected admins, the Dutch cops had discovered, were across the border in Germany—one 30-year-old man in the city of Siegen, and another 31-year-old in Cologne. But when the NHTCU contacted the German authorities to request their arrest and extradition, they discovered the pair were already on the radar of German authorities, and under investigation for the creation of Lul.to, a site selling pirated ebooks and audiobooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;That gave the Dutch investigators an idea: Perhaps they could use the existing German investigation as cover for their own operation, letting the German police nab their suspects for e-book piracy and then secretly taking over Hansa without tipping off the market's users. &quot;We came up with this plan to take over. We could use that arrest,&quot; says Gert Ras, the head of the NHTCU. &quot;We had to get rid of the real administrators to become the administrators ourselves.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Just as the NHTCU's elaborate trap started to take shape, however, it was also falling apart: The Hansa servers the Dutch cops were watching suddenly went silent. Ras and Boekelo say they suspect that their copying of the servers somehow tipped off the site's admins. As a result, they had moved the market to another Tor-protected location, shuffling it in Tor's vast deck of anonymized machines around the globe. &quot;That was a setback,&quot; Ras says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Even then, remarkably, the Dutch cops didn't simply cut their losses, ask the Germans to arrest Hansa's administrators, and likely used clues from their computers to find the site's servers and shut them down. Instead, they decided to stick with their stealthy takeover plan, and spent the ensuing months poring over evidence—even as the site continued its brisk narcotics trade—in an attempt to locate the Hansa servers again and quietly hijack them. Finally in April 2017, they got another lucky break: The alleged administrators had made a bitcoin payment from an address that had been included in those same IRC chatlogs. Using the blockchain analysis software Chainalysis, the police could see that payment went to a bitcoin payment provider with an office in the Netherlands. And when the police sent that bitcoin payment firm a legal demand to cough up more information, it identified the recipient of that transaction as another hosting company, this time in Lithuania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Two For One&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Not long after pinpointing those servers for the second time, the NHTCU learned of another surprising windfall: The FBI contacted them to tell them that they'd &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/alphabay-takedown-dark-web-chaos/&quot;&gt;located one of the servers for AlphaBay&lt;/a&gt;, the world's most popular dark-web drug market at the time—far larger than Hansa—in the Netherlands. American investigators were closing in and wanted to pull the plug, just as the Dutch were planning to commandeer Hansa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;The Dutch police quickly realized that after AlphaBay was shut down, its refugees would go searching for a new marketplace. If their scheme worked, AlphaBay's users would flood to Hansa, which would secretly be under police control. &quot;Not only would we get this effect of undermining the trust in dark markets, we'd also get this influx of people,&quot; Ras says. They'd be able to surveil a far larger portion of the dark-web economy, he says, and instill a sense in users that there was nowhere to hide. Even fleeing to another marketplace wouldn't let them escape law enforcement's reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;With the pieces of the takeover plan in place, the Dutch police sent a pair of agents to the Lithuanian data center, taking advantage of the two countries' mutual legal assistance treaty. On June 20, in a carefully timed move designed to catch the two German suspects at the keyboard, the German police raided the two men's homes, arrested them, and seized their computers with their hard drives unencrypted. The Germans then signaled the Dutch police, who immediately began the migration of all of Hansa's data to a new set of servers under full police control in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;&quot;We coordinated with the Germans, so that when they busted in the door we immediately started our action,&quot; says Boekelo. &quot;We didn’t want to have any downtime.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Under questioning in a German jail, the two men handed over credentials to their accounts, including the Tox peer-to-peer chat system they had used to communicate with the site's four moderators. After three days, Hansa was fully migrated to the Netherlands and under Dutch police control. No users—or even those moderators—appeared to have noticed the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Total Control&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;For the next month, the Dutch police would use their position at the top of Europe's largest dark-web market to pull off increasingly aggressive surveillance of its users. They rewrote the site's code, they say, to log every user's password, rather than store them as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2016/06/hacker-lexicon-password-hashing/&quot;&gt;encrypted hashes&lt;/a&gt;. They tweaked a feature designed to automatically encrypt messages with users' PGP keys, so that it secretly logged each message's full text before encrypting it, which in many cases allowed them to capture buyers' home addresses as they sent the information to sellers. The site had been set up to automatically removed metadata from photos of products uploaded to the site; they altered that function so that it first recorded a copy of the image with metadata intact. That enabled them to pull geolocation data from many photos that sellers had taken of their illegal wares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite class=&quot;caption-component__credit&quot;&gt;NHTCU&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;As they tell it, the police eventually became so brazen that they staged a fake server glitch that deleted all the photos from the site, forcing sellers to re-upload photos and giving Dutch authorities another chance to capture the metadata. That ruse alone snagged the geolocated coordinates of more than 50 dealers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;In perhaps its most intrusive move of all, the NHTCU says it essentially tricked users into downloading and running a homing beacon. Hansa offered sellers a file to serve as a backup key, designed to let them recover bitcoin sent to them after 90 days even if the sites were to go down. The cops replaced that harmless text document with a carefully crafted Excel file, says Boekelo. When a seller opened it, their device would connect to a unique url, revealing the seller's IP address to the police. Boekelo says that 64 sellers fell for that trap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Throughout the trickery, Hansa thrived under the NCHTU's secret control. The undercover agents had studied the logs of the real admins' conversations with their moderators and the site's users long enough to convincingly impersonate them, Ras and Boekelo say. In fact, a whole team of officers took turns impersonating the two admins, so that when disputes between buyers and sellers escalated beyond the moderators' authority, undercover agents were ready to deal with them even more efficiently than the real admins had. &quot;The quality really went up,&quot; says Ras. &quot;Everyone was very satisfied with the level of service they got.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Springing the Trap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;That competence also made Hansa the natural destination when AlphaBay suddenly winked out of existence in early July of last year. As drug buyers became impatient, eventually more than 5,000 a day of them flocked to Hansa, eight times the normal registration rate, the NHTCU says—all of whom immediately fell under police surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;One week after Alphabay first went down, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/illegal-goods-website-alphabay-shut-following-law-enforcement-action-1499968444&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wall Street Journal reported&lt;/a&gt; that the site's servers had been seized in a law enforcement raid and that its founder, Canadian Alexandre Cazès, had apparently committed suicide in a Thai prison. The news &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/alphabay-takedown-dark-web-chaos/&quot;&gt;threw the dark web community into chaos&lt;/a&gt;. The resulting flood of Alphabay refugees became so large that the NHTCU shut down new registrations for ten days. The police were bound by Dutch law to track and report every transaction occurring on the site under their control to Europol; with roughly 1,000 illegal transactions occurring every day on their watch, the paperwork was becoming unmanageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js-skip-wide-content large-component paywall large-component--image&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After AlphaBay's shutdown, users poured into Hansa, which was under the Dutch police's full control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite class=&quot;caption-component__credit&quot;&gt;NCHTU&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;During their time as black market administrators, the Dutch police only banned one product on Hansa: the highly dangerous opioid Fentanyl. All other drugs on the site continued to flow freely, a circumstance over which Ras and Boekelo seem surprisingly unconflicted. &quot;They would have taken place anyway,&quot; says Ras without hesitation, &quot;but on a different market.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;After 27 days and about 27,000 transactions, however, the NHTCU decided to hang up its ledger. It unplugged Hansa, replacing the site with a seizure notice and a link to the NHTCU's own Tor site showing a list of identified and arrested dark-web drug buyers and sellers. &quot;We trace people who are active at Dark Markets and offer illicit goods or services,&quot; the site read. &quot;Are you one of them? Then you have our attention.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Fallout&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;The Dutch police came away from their Hansa takeover with concrete rewards: They obtained at least some data on 420,000 users, including at least 10,000 home addresses, which they've turned over to Europol to be distributed to other police agencies around Europe and the world. Since the takedown, Ras says, they've arrested a dozen of Hansa's top vendors, with more arrests planned for coming weeks. They seized 1,200 bitcoins from Hansa, worth about $12 million by today's exchange rates. Since Hansa used bitcoin's multi-signature transaction function to protect funds from police seizure, that confiscation was only possible because the NHTCU had taken over the site and sabotaged its code to disable that feature during Hansa's last month online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;The Dutch police say they've also performed roughly 50 &quot;knock-and-talks,&quot; in-person visits to buyers' homes to let them know they've been identified by their dark-web drug purchases, though they say only one high-volume buyer has been arrested so far. &quot;We want people to be aware,&quot; says Ras. &quot;We have the data. It's here, and it's not going away.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inset-left-component paywall inset-left-component--pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;inset-left&quot; class=&quot;inset-left-component__el&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Everyone was very satisfied with the level of service they got.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;inset-left&quot; class=&quot;inset-left-component__el&quot;&gt;Gert Ras, NHU&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;As for the operation's impact on the overall drug trade, the police point to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tno.nl/media/10032/17-9099-factsheetbrochure-dws-05.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study by the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research&lt;/a&gt;, which found that the Hansa hijacking did have a significantly different outcome from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2017/05/silk-road-creators-life-sentence-actually-boosted-dark-web-drug-sales/&quot;&gt;previous dark-web takedowns&lt;/a&gt;. While most drug vendors who fled AlphaBay showed up soon after on other dark web drug sites, those who fled Hansa didn't—or if they did, they recreated their online identities thoroughly enough to escape recognition. &quot;Compared to both the Silk Road takedowns, or even the AlphaBay takedown, the Hansa Market shut down stands out in a positive way,&quot; the report reads. &quot;We see the first signs of game-changing police intervention.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Other dark-web trackers aren't so sure. Nicolas Christin, a researcher at Carnegie Mellon, says it's tough to measure the long-term impact of the Hansa operation, as drug buyers and sellers still flock to alternative sites like Dream Market, the new top dark-web drug site after Hansa and AlphaBay's desmise, and even to invite-only sites created by individual sellers. &quot;I think in the short term, it created a lot of upheaval,&quot; Christin says. &quot;Whether it was sustained, I really don't know.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;As for Hansa's users themselves, opinion seems split. &quot;Looks like I'll be sober for a while. Not trusting any markets,&quot; one user wrote on Reddit's darknet-focused forum the day the Hansa takedown was announced last summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;But some insisted that the dark web would bounce back, even from the most elaborate sting operation it had ever seen. &quot;Things will stabilize, they always do,&quot; that anonymous user wrote. &quot;The Great Game of whack-a-mole never ends.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

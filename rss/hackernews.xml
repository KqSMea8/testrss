&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1:&lt;/strong&gt; The thing I loved most about working in developer relations at NeXT was how Steve could call anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He would burst in my office and say, “I’m gonna call Bill about TrueType,” and gesture for me to follow. A minute later he’d have Bill Gates on the speaker phone with me in fly-on-the-wall mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“BUT BILL! You ripped off Adobe and made John &lt;em&gt;cry&lt;/em&gt;.” (John Warnock was the CEO of Adobe.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Steve, we didn’t want to get into the font business. It’s a nightmare. But Adobe wouldn’t open their fonts until they had competition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One time Steve said, “I invited Jonathan Seybold here for a day. Make sure he gets access to everyone who can explain details, like 4 bits of transparency in our new color printers. Bring him to me at 4 o’clock.” Seybold Expos were &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; force in electronic publishing then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve let me be a fly on the wall for his two hours with Jonathan that day. It was fascinating to see Steve in intense listening mode, asking short questions and sitting patiently for Jonathan’s careful answers. “Jonathan, how are we different from Apple?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oh, that’s an important question. That deserves a thoughtful answer.” I’ve played Jonathan’s answer in my head 1,000 times since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Jonathan said we were just like Apple, but very different from Microsoft. Microsoft had turned software creation into a factory process. Three people would visit him with a 1.0 product who seemed to be product managers. They took notes furiously as he tried the product, which was never any good. As he pointed out the things he didn’t like they would enthusiastically say, “thank you Jonathan!” And they’d dig for more details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’d come back in a year with a much-improved 2.0 that was still not ready for prime time and the process would repeat. Finally they’d return with a 3.0 and it was good enough to get respect and market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple, on the other hand, would send its creator. He or she wanted to build something insanely great on the first try that would change the world. Their mission was to get Jonathan to love it. It was hard for him to give feedback because the creator would get ever more defensive and deflated if Jonathan tried. After awhile it was too uncomfortable and he stopped trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always wondered how Steve took that answer, because it described himself so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc-attachments&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;cakedoc-lightbox-link&quot; href=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/BpSksnMyK1w4_1532447172246.png&quot; itemprop=&quot;sharedContent&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cakedoc-image&quot; src=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/BpSksnMyK1w4_1532447172246.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/BpSksnMyK1w4_1532447172246.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680 1x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/BpSksnMyK1w4_1532447172246.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/BpSksnMyK1w4_1532447172246.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 3:&lt;/strong&gt; One visitor was George Fisher, the superstar CEO of high-flying Motorola. Their processors powered Apple and NeXT computers. He dropped a bomb that caught me completely by surprise: the Motorola 68000 line of processors we used was near its end of life because it had become too hard to cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer was to adopt their upcoming processor, the Motorola 88110. To me it felt like the kind of crushing blow that could kill our fragile company. We would have to design new hardware. Who knew how much work it would take to get our operating system to support it? I would have to tell our developers that their lives were going to get more complicated and expensive. What if Motorola didn’t get enough support for it and we had to change processors again?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, there was a widespread belief that Intel’s processors were also at an evolutionary dead-end and Microsoft would face our fate as well. I made a list of options: Sun’s Sparc chip? At least they had shown that you could move from the Motorola 68000 to a so-called Reduced Instruction Set chip and succeed. But they were our enemy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIPS, the respected chip company Silicon Graphics bought? That made us dependent on a competitor. But supporters of Motorola’s 88110 didn’t look like a who’s-who of the industry, except Apple, and I heard they were wavering.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can’t explain why I couldn’t just chill and trust Steve, George Fisher and our engineers. Who was I to to get so worked up over it? Steve called me at 11 one night to settle me down but I couldn’t let it go. I wanted to know what Intel was doing and everyone just shrugged. Steve had a philosophy of betting on technologies in the spring of their lives, not the autumn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day Steve held a meeting with our engineers and me where he punctuated the air dramatically with his finger and said, “This company will live or die by its choice to support the 88110.” I don’t know what came over me. I said “die.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc-attachments&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;cakedoc-lightbox-link&quot; href=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/GkgpztwJqjPc_1532447353049.png&quot; itemprop=&quot;sharedContent&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cakedoc-image&quot; src=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/GkgpztwJqjPc_1532447353049.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/GkgpztwJqjPc_1532447353049.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680 1x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/GkgpztwJqjPc_1532447353049.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/GkgpztwJqjPc_1532447353049.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 4:&lt;/strong&gt; That was the last word spoken in the meeting and I could tell Steve was mad. I was mad too. An engineer walked me to my office while saying it had been nice knowing me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I closed my office door, picked up the phone, and asked for Andy Grove. I wanted to know why they weren’t in the conversation. I guessed it was because we used the Intel i860 chip on one of our graphics boards and it didn’t impress us. But what were Michael Dell, Bill Gates and Andy going to do about the Intel 80486 facing the same fate as Motorola’s 68040? I had to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got Andy’s assistant on the phone. His assistants were executives-in-training who spent 2 years mentoring under Andy. I explained that if Steve heard about this call I would be fired. I justified the call by saying sometimes history has shown you have to do the right thing and keep it secret from Steve until later, as the Mac team famously did when they hid a Sony engineer in the Apple building so Steve wouldn’t find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I said I had no idea what Steve’s relationship with Andy was. For all I knew, Steve thought Intel chips were shit (the word Steve would have used). But I knew Steve liked people at the top of their fields who admired and mentored him. Could I meet with Andy and explain our situation so Andy could call Steve?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he would ask Andy. He called back and scheduled a two-hour meeting at Intel, saying Andy would be there. I suddenly felt I had to have an engineer there and sought William Parkhurst, who I admired as one of the most influential engineers we ever hired. I fessed up to my boss, Mike Slade, about what we were doing. Max Henry, Donna Simonides, William and I piled in my Honda Accord and headed for Intel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc-attachments&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;cakedoc-lightbox-link&quot; href=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/c31m3drQZscH_1532447533032.jpeg&quot; itemprop=&quot;sharedContent&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cakedoc-image&quot; src=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/c31m3drQZscH_1532447533032.jpeg?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/c31m3drQZscH_1532447533032.jpeg?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680 1x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/c31m3drQZscH_1532447533032.jpeg?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/c31m3drQZscH_1532447533032.jpeg?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 5:&lt;/strong&gt; Our engineers told us Intel chips were inferior to Motorola’s and they only became a standard because Intel had managed to convince IBM’s PC division to use them. I had read two of Andy’s books and was concerned that he was a salesman prone to exaggeration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that was exactly my impression when I met him. Motorola couldn’t push the 68040 past 40 megahertz and to their credit, 40 megahertz was insane! Oh my God. The only thing more insane was Intel’s 80486 running at 66 megahertz! Can you imagine? I was a physicist, I should know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s when Andy lost some credibility with me. I can’t remember exactly what he said about future speeds, but I seem to remember 400 megahertz or maybe even more. Oh, please. You’re claiming 10x more than Motorola? Everyone knows Motorola is the more technically capable company. You won’t be able to bullshit Steve the way you did IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet. He seemed so confident. Probably just a good actor?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought the plan should be for Andy to call Steve and admire him for all he’s done (not hard to do). Bring technical people up to meet Steve’s, offer a few really great engineers to do a test port of NeXTstep on Intel, and provide some funding. Maybe Steve would bite?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andy’s assistant said he’d keep me up to date on what happened next. I left wondering what Bill Gates and Michael Dell thought of Andy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc-attachments&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;cakedoc-lightbox-link&quot; href=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/McX7VsrrTmz0_1532447639934.jpeg&quot; itemprop=&quot;sharedContent&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cakedoc-image&quot; src=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/McX7VsrrTmz0_1532447639934.jpeg?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/McX7VsrrTmz0_1532447639934.jpeg?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680 1x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/McX7VsrrTmz0_1532447639934.jpeg?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/McX7VsrrTmz0_1532447639934.jpeg?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 6:&lt;/strong&gt; When the first call came it was to say Andy and a large contingent from Intel were meeting Steve in the big downstairs conference room. Andy’s assistant didn’t know who was involved on our side besides Steve. I never heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometime later Steve wandered in my office and asked if I thought porting NeXTstep to Intel was a good idea. Awkward. Did he know? I asked if Intel was going to help. Steve said they offered two great engineers to work alongside ours. They thought it could be done in 6 months. We’d have to keep it super secret from the outside world. Could I act as relationship manager?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t as strange as it sounded because I was managing the IBM relationship. Steve had licensed NeXTstep for them to use on their workstations years ago and they had a team living at NeXT working on it. We didn’t have much faith in that relationship.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hmmm, that sounds like a good idea, Steve. The 66 megahertz 80486 chip?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yeah. Intel’s graphics primitives are shit so it probably won’t be any faster than the 33 megahertz 68040 we’re using now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six months later I carried a beige Intel-based computer from a windowless room to my office, wrapped in a black cover. It was exactly twice the speed of our sexy black machines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc-attachments&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;cakedoc-lightbox-link&quot; href=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/CGkZYx1SjTd5_1532447784613.png&quot; itemprop=&quot;sharedContent&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cakedoc-image&quot; src=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/CGkZYx1SjTd5_1532447784613.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/CGkZYx1SjTd5_1532447784613.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680 1x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/CGkZYx1SjTd5_1532447784613.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/CGkZYx1SjTd5_1532447784613.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 7:&lt;/strong&gt; Steve and William had made plans to package NeXTstep as software for retail sales at Comp USA and other stores. I didn’t see that coming. I was angling for building sleek black machines with Intel inside, but we were sticking to the plan of making a dual-88110 workstation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The belief was the future of computing was Reduced Instruction Set architectures, not a PC-based chip. All the workstation companies like Sun, HP, Silicon Graphics and IBM had gone that way. I don’t think the workstation world believed that Andy could keep increasing the speed of his processors like he claimed he could. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understood. Andy came across as a bit of a slickster to me whereas George Fischer was the real deal, the man The New York Times referred to as a gold-plated executive in a 12-carat company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc-attachments&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;cakedoc-lightbox-link&quot; href=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/HXT6XG2jfzxh_1532447923486.png&quot; itemprop=&quot;sharedContent&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cakedoc-image&quot; src=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/HXT6XG2jfzxh_1532447923486.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/HXT6XG2jfzxh_1532447923486.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680 1x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/HXT6XG2jfzxh_1532447923486.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/HXT6XG2jfzxh_1532447923486.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 8:&lt;/strong&gt; I got a call a few months later from General Magic. Their vision was so compelling I accepted their offer to work there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selling NeXTstep as software wasn’t going well and NeXT discontinued making hardware before they could ship the 88110-based workstation. Far as I knew, only Data General was making a machine with 88110s. Apple had abandoned it and teamed up with IBM &amp;amp; Motorola to produce the PowerPC processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NeXT became less relevant, but word was Steve and Andy were getting along. Andy conducted offsites with Steve and his team to teach his management methods that would become so famous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George Fisher made a fateful decision to become CEO of Kodak. The reputations of Motorola, Kodak, or George would never be the same again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then news broke that would change the world: Apple bought NeXT and Steve became CEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 9:&lt;/strong&gt; The man who made the decision to buy NeXT was Gil Amelio, CEO of Apple at the time and former CEO of National Semiconductor. He wrote a book about how he saved Apple. He agreed to speak at a bookstore in San Jose that I owned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He only took one question at the end. He called on John Markoff, the famous New York Times tech journalist. “Gil,” John asked, “why did you end up buying NeXT instead of Be?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be OS, like NeXTstep, was very respected and the man who ran Be was Jean-Louis Gassée, former high-profile Apple exec. Steve told Walter Isaacson that Gassée was &quot;one of the few people who I'd say is truly horrible. He knifed me in the back.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how I’ve remembered Gil’s answer over the years: “Great question, we had big internal debates about that. A lot of people at Apple were afraid of Steve and Jean-Louis had many supporters. Be OS was very respected. In the end it came down to NeXT already supporting Intel and that was important to us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remember thinking, &lt;em&gt;oh my God. Steve, you owe me&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc-attachments&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;cakedoc-lightbox-link&quot; href=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/xqKXBM1gCNRG_1532450088239.png&quot; itemprop=&quot;sharedContent&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cakedoc-image&quot; src=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/xqKXBM1gCNRG_1532450088239.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/xqKXBM1gCNRG_1532450088239.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680 1x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/xqKXBM1gCNRG_1532450088239.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/xqKXBM1gCNRG_1532450088239.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 10:&lt;/strong&gt; Turns out I wasn’t the only one to make secret calls and Andy wasn’t the only one to return them. John Landwehr was a product manager at NeXT who got the idea to call Ellen Hancock, Apple’s CTO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/23/business/why-apple-sees-next-as-a-match-made-in-heaven.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an article by John Markoff&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading newspaper accounts saying that Apple was in private discussions about acquiring a new operating system, Mr. Landwehr, without a word to Steven P. Jobs, his company's chairman, persuaded his colleague Garrett Rice to pick up the phone and call Ms. Hancock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out Andy was underselling when he said his processors might go to 400 megahertz, 10x what Motorola ever achieved with the 68040. The clock speeds of current Intel processors are more than 4200 megahertz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 10 years after the computing world believed Intel’s processors were in the autumn of their lives, Apple based their computers on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gil Amelio:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 11 (last part):&lt;/strong&gt; The Harvard Business Review published an article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2002/09/the-curse-of-the-superstar-ceo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Curse of the Superstar CEO&lt;/a&gt;, which tried to explain the fall of George Fisher and Kodak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I always wonder. Was it really about the CEOs? Or were there technical superstars we don’t know about who figured out how to make processors faster without overheating? That’s something I loved about Steve Jobs: he would ask who on planet earth is the best person to pull off something impossible and he would do anything to hire them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know one of those. Steve spent all day in early Apple recruiting Bill Atkinson, a Phd student in neuroscience. Steve told me he didn’t know if they could have pulled off the Mac without him. I have seen Bill solve hard technical problems I don’t think anyone else could solve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if Andy had one of those and George didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs and Bill Atkinson:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris, all kidding aside.....I hope you have plans to write a book. It would be VERY interesting and it seems your &quot;fly-on-the-wall&quot; perspectives are historically important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've often wondered what the computing world would look like today if Apple had bought Be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BeOS&lt;/a&gt; was a fantastic operating system, more advanced in many ways than other OSes of the era. I actually very briefly used it as my primary OS in the late 90s. But Be wasn't able to succeed as an independent company, and with the release of Mac OS X (which was heavily based on concepts and code from NeXT), Apple suddenly had a much better OS, and BeOS was relegated to the history books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But somewhere out there is a parallel universe where BeOS, rather than OpenStep, became the basis for Apple's new OS. Would it have been able to compete with Windows? Without macOS's BSD underpinnings, would it have been as popular with developers as Mac OS X was? I wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc-attachments&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;cakedoc-lightbox-link&quot; href=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/R987rtpTCkPw_1532457294986.png&quot; itemprop=&quot;sharedContent&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cakedoc-image&quot; src=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/R987rtpTCkPw_1532457294986.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/R987rtpTCkPw_1532457294986.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680 1x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/R987rtpTCkPw_1532457294986.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/R987rtpTCkPw_1532457294986.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great read, and made me miss my days working on my old NeXT work stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was an incredible read. You've lived quite the life. I'll have to check out more about Bill Atkinson. I wonder what sort of neuroscience he worked on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great series of posts, Chris! At Microsoft, we used to say that “the #1 feature is shipping”. It wasn’t always good for customers, but it sure did let msft exploit their user base to quickly learn and develop a decent product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazing story!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it always amazes me what it takes for things to happen good and bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this didn’t happen this wouldn’t have happened. Almost at times like there is some sort of design going on in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fascinating. Tangentially, Intel saved the X86 architecture (boosting it 10x, 100x, etc.) after DIGITAL had asked them to &quot;analyze&quot; its breakthrough MicroPrism (aka DEC Alpha) chip for &quot;second sourcing&quot; at Intel's state-of-the-art FABs. The dishonesty of lifting that IP to &quot;rescue&quot; the X86 led to a legal settlement wherein Intel consented to purchase DEC's Hudson plant, that included not just the Alpha's chips, but also the StrongARM chips. (Old money on both boards and that's the way they handle scandals.) Chris' testimonial makes me believe that more people besides Andy Grove at Intel knew that the X86 was being &quot;rescued&quot; in this way...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I totally agree with Steve about Gassée, convinced there was an Amiga 1000 in the basement of One Infinite Loop fueling all of that period's innovations (GfxBase-&amp;gt;QuickDrawGX, ARexx-&amp;gt;AppleScript, Speech-&amp;gt;PlainTalk, etc..) sustaining an unbelievable amount of politics much to Bill Gates' delight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;Researchers have found evidence of an existing body of liquid water on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they believe to be a lake sits under the planet's south polar ice cap, and is about 20km (12 miles) across.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research found possible signs of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-34379284&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;intermittent liquid water flowing&lt;/a&gt; on the martian surface, but this is the first sign of a persistent body of water on the planet in the present day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lake beds like those explored by Nasa's Curiosity rover show water was present on the surface of Mars in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the planet's climate has since cooled due to its thin atmosphere, leaving most of its water locked up in ice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is exciting because scientists have long searched for signs of present-day liquid water on Mars, but these have come up empty or yielded ambiguous findings. It will also interest those studying the possibilities for life beyond Earth - though it does not yet raise the stakes in the search for biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery was made using Marsis, a radar instrument on board the European Space Agency's (Esa) Mars Express orbiter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's probably not a very large lake,&quot; said Prof Roberto Orosei from the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marsis wasn't able to determine how thick the layer of water might be, but the research team estimate that it is a minimum of one metre. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This really qualifies this as a body of water. A lake, not some kind of meltwater filling some space between rock and ice, as happens in certain glaciers on Earth,&quot; Prof Orosei added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

Yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Manish Patel from the Open University explained: &quot;We have long since known that the surface of Mars is inhospitable to life as we know it, so the search for life on Mars is now in the subsurface.       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is where we get sufficient protection from harmful radiation, and the pressure and temperature rise to more favourable levels. Most importantly, this allows liquid water, essential for life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This principle of following the water is key to astrobiology - the study of potential life beyond Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while the findings suggest water is present, they don't confirm anything further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are not closer to actually detecting life,&quot; Dr Patel told BBC News, &quot;but what this finding does is give us the location of where to look on Mars. It is like a treasure map - except in this case, there will be lots of 'X's marking the spots.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                    Astrobiologists study extreme environments like salt lakes on Earth to understand how life might survive on Mars
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The water's temperature and chemistry could also pose a problem for any potential martian organisms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to remain liquid in such cold conditions (the research team estimate between -10 and -30 Celsius where it meets the ice above), the water likely has a great many salts dissolved in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's plausible that the water may be an extremely cold, concentrated brine, which would be pretty challenging for life,&quot; explained Dr Claire Cousins, an astrobiologist from the University of St Andrews, UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;What next?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While its existence provides a tantalising prospect for those interested in the possibility of past or present life on Mars, the lake's characteristics must first be verified by further research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What needs to be done now,&quot; explained Dr Matt Balme from the Open University, &quot;is for the measurements to be repeated elsewhere to look for similar signals, and, if possible, for all other explanation to be examined and - hopefully - ruled out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Maybe this could even be the trigger for an ambitious new Mars mission to drill into this buried water-pocket - like has been done for sub-glacial lakes in Antarctica on Earth,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

This will certainly require some technological developments that at the moment are not available.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were reported in &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aar7268&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Mary &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/maryhalton&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption body-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early Google employees decided to work with a shared codebase managed through a centralized source control system. This approach has served Google well for more than 16 years, and today the vast majority of Google's software assets continues to be stored in a single, shared repository. Meanwhile, the number of Google software developers has steadily increased, and the size of the Google codebase has grown exponentially (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#F1&quot;&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt;). As a result, the technology used to host the codebase has also evolved significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;totop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#PageTop&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Key Insights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/2860000/2854146/ins01.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; vspace=&quot;5&quot; hspace=&quot;5&quot; alt=&quot;ins01.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article outlines the scale of that codebase and details Google's custom-built monolithic source repository and the reasons the model was chosen. Google uses a homegrown version-control system to host one large codebase visible to, and used by, most of the software developers in the company. This centralized system is the foundation of many of Google's developer workflows. Here, we provide background on the systems and workflows that make feasible managing and working productively with such a large repository. We explain Google's &quot;trunk-based development&quot; strategy and the support systems that structure workflow and keep Google's codebase healthy, including software for static analysis, code cleanup, and streamlined code review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;totop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#PageTop&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Google-Scale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google's monolithic software repository, which is used by 95% of its software developers worldwide, meets the definition of an ultra-large-scale&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#R4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; system, providing evidence the single-source repository model can be scaled successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Google codebase includes approximately one billion files and has a history of approximately 35 million commits spanning Google's entire 18-year existence. The repository contains 86TB&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#FNA&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of data, including approximately two billion lines of code in nine million unique source files. The total number of files also includes source files copied into release branches, files that are deleted at the latest revision, configuration files, documentation, and supporting data files; see the table here for a summary of Google's repository statistics from January 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, approximately 15 million lines of code were changed&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#FNB&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in approximately 250,000 files in the Google repository on a weekly basis. The Linux kernel is a prominent example of a large open source software repository containing approximately 15 million lines of code in 40,000 files.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#R14&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google's codebase is shared by more than 25,000 Google software developers from dozens of offices in countries around the world. On a typical workday, they commit 16,000 changes to the codebase, and another 24,000 changes are committed by automated systems. Each day the repository serves billions of file read requests, with approximately 800,000 queries per second during peak traffic and an average of approximately 500,000 queries per second each workday. Most of this traffic originates from Google's distributed build-and-test systems.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#FNC&quot;&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#F2&quot;&gt;Figure 2&lt;/a&gt; reports the number of unique human committers per week to the main repository, January 2010-July 2015. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#F3&quot;&gt;Figure 3&lt;/a&gt; reports commits per week to Google's main repository over the same time period. The line for total commits includes data for both the interactive use case, or human users, and automated use cases. Larger dips in both graphs occur during holidays affecting a significant number of employees (such as Christmas Day and New Year's Day, American Thanksgiving Day, and American Independence Day).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 2012, Google's central repository added support for Windows and Mac users (until then it was Linux-only), and the existing Windows and Mac repository was merged with the main repository. Google's tooling for repository merges attributes all historical changes being merged to their original authors, hence the corresponding bump in the graph in &lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#F2&quot;&gt;Figure 2&lt;/a&gt;. The effect of this merge is also apparent in &lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#F1&quot;&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commits-per-week graph shows the commit rate was dominated by human users until 2012, at which point Google switched to a custom-source-control implementation for hosting the central repository, as discussed later. Following this transition, automated commits to the repository began to increase. Growth in the commit rate continues primarily due to automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing this scale of repository and activity on it has been an ongoing challenge for Google. Despite several years of experimentation, Google was not able to find a commercially available or open source version-control system to support such scale in a single repository. The Google proprietary system that was built to store, version, and vend this codebase is code-named Piper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;totop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#PageTop&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before reviewing the advantages and disadvantages of working with a monolithic repository, some background on Google's tooling and workflows is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Piper and CitC&lt;/strong&gt;. Piper stores a single large repository and is implemented on top of standard Google infrastructure, originally Bigtable,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#R2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; now Spanner.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#R3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Piper is distributed over 10 Google data centers around the world, relying on the Paxos&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#R6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; algorithm to guarantee consistency across replicas. This architecture provides a high level of redundancy and helps optimize latency for Google software developers, no matter where they work. In addition, caching and asynchronous operations hide much of the network latency from developers. This is important because gaining the full benefit of Google's cloud-based toolchain requires developers to be online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google relied on one primary Perforce instance, hosted on a single machine, coupled with custom caching infrastructure&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#R1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for more than 10 years prior to the launch of Piper. Continued scaling of the Google repository was the main motivation for developing Piper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Google's source code is one of the company's most important assets, security features are a key consideration in Piper's design. Piper supports file-level access control lists. Most of the repository is visible to all Piper users;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#FND&quot;&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; however, important configuration files or files including business-critical algorithms can be more tightly controlled. In addition, read and write access to files in Piper is logged. If sensitive data is accidentally committed to Piper, the file in question can be purged. The read logs allow administrators to determine if anyone accessed the problematic file before it was removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Piper workflow (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#F4&quot;&gt;Figure 4&lt;/a&gt;), developers create a local copy of files in the repository before changing them. These files are stored in a workspace owned by the developer. A Piper workspace is comparable to a working copy in Apache Subversion, a local clone in Git, or a client in Perforce. Updates from the Piper repository can be pulled into a workspace and merged with ongoing work, as desired (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#F5&quot;&gt;Figure 5&lt;/a&gt;). A snapshot of the workspace can be shared with other developers for review. Files in a workspace are committed to the central repository only after going through the Google code-review process, as described later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most developers access Piper through a system called Clients in the Cloud, or CitC, which consists of a cloud-based storage backend and a Linux-only FUSE&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#R13&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; file system. Developers see their workspaces as directories in the file system, including their changes overlaid on top of the full Piper repository. CitC supports code browsing and normal Unix tools with no need to clone or sync state locally. Developers can browse and edit files anywhere across the Piper repository, and only modified files are stored in their workspace. This structure means CitC workspaces typically consume only a small amount of storage (an average workspace has fewer than 10 files) while presenting a seamless view of the entire Piper codebase to the developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All writes to files are stored as snapshots in CitC, making it possible to recover previous stages of work as needed. Snapshots may be explicitly named, restored, or tagged for review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CitC workspaces are available on any machine that can connect to the cloud-based storage system, making it easy to switch machines and pick up work without interruption. It also makes it possible for developers to view each other's work in CitC workspaces. Storing all in-progress work in the cloud is an important element of the Google workflow process. Working state is thus available to other tools, including the cloud-based build system, the automated test infrastructure, and the code browsing, editing, and review tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several workflows take advantage of the availability of uncommitted code in CitC to make software developers working with the large codebase more productive. For instance, when sending a change out for code review, developers can enable an auto-commit option, which is particularly useful when code authors and reviewers are in different time zones. When the review is marked as complete, the tests will run; if they pass, the code will be committed to the repository without further human intervention. The Google code-browsing tool CodeSearch supports simple edits using CitC workspaces. While browsing the repository, developers can click on a button to enter edit mode and make a simple change (such as fixing a typo or improving a comment). Then, without leaving the code browser, they can send their changes out to the appropriate reviewers with auto-commit enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piper can also be used without CitC. Developers can instead store Piper workspaces on their local machines. Piper also has limited interoperability with Git. Over 80% of Piper users today use CitC, with adoption continuing to grow due to the many benefits provided by CitC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piper and CitC make working productively with a single, monolithic source repository possible at the scale of the Google codebase. The design and architecture of these systems were both heavily influenced by the trunk-based development paradigm employed at Google, as described here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trunk-based development&lt;/strong&gt;. Google practices trunk-based development on top of the Piper source repository. The vast majority of Piper users work at the &quot;head,&quot; or most recent, version of a single copy of the code called &quot;trunk&quot; or &quot;mainline.&quot; Changes are made to the repository in a single, serial ordering. The combination of trunk-based development with a central repository defines the monolithic codebase model. Immediately after any commit, the new code is visible to, and usable by, all other developers. The fact that Piper users work on a single consistent view of the Google codebase is key for providing the advantages described later in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trunk-based development is beneficial in part because it avoids the painful merges that often occur when it is time to reconcile long-lived branches. Development on branches is unusual and not well supported at Google, though branches are typically used for releases. Release branches are cut from a specific revision of the repository. Bug fixes and enhancements that must be added to a release are typically developed on mainline, then cherry-picked into the release branch (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#F6&quot;&gt;Figure 6&lt;/a&gt;). Due to the need to maintain stability and limit churn on the release branch, a release is typically a snapshot of head, with an optional small number of cherry-picks pulled in from head as needed. Use of long-lived branches with parallel development on the branch and mainline is exceedingly rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;/&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Piper and CitC make working productively with a single, monolithic source repository possible at the scale of the Google codebase.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;When new features are developed, both new and old code paths commonly exist simultaneously, controlled through the use of conditional flags. This technique avoids the need for a development branch and makes it easy to turn on and off features through configuration updates rather than full binary releases. While some additional complexity is incurred for developers, the merge problems of a development branch are avoided. Flag flips make it much easier and faster to switch users off new implementations that have problems. This method is typically used in project-specific code, not common library code, and eventually flags are retired so old code can be deleted. Google uses a similar approach for routing live traffic through different code paths to perform experiments that can be tuned in real time through configuration changes. Such A/B experiments can measure everything from the performance characteristics of the code to user engagement related to subtle product changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google workflow&lt;/strong&gt;. Several best practices and supporting systems are required to avoid constant breakage in the trunk-based development model, where thousands of engineers commit thousands of changes to the repository on a daily basis. For instance, Google has an automated testing infrastructure that initiates a rebuild of all affected dependencies on almost every change committed to the repository. If a change creates widespread build breakage, a system is in place to automatically undo the change. To reduce the incidence of bad code being committed in the first place, the highly customizable Google &quot;presubmit&quot; infrastructure provides automated testing and analysis of changes before they are added to the codebase. A set of global presubmit analyses are run for all changes, and code owners can create custom analyses that run only on directories within the codebase they specify. A small set of very low-level core libraries uses a mechanism similar to a development branch to enforce additional testing before new versions are exposed to client code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important aspect of Google culture that encourages code quality is the expectation that all code is reviewed before being committed to the repository. Most developers can view and propose changes to files anywhere across the entire codebase—with the exception of a small set of highly confidential code that is more carefully controlled. The risk associated with developers changing code they are not deeply familiar with is mitigated through the code-review process and the concept of code ownership. The Google codebase is laid out in a tree structure. Each and every directory has a set of owners who control whether a change to files in their directory will be accepted. Owners are typically the developers who work on the projects in the directories in question. A change often receives a detailed code review from one developer, evaluating the quality of the change, and a commit approval from an owner, evaluating the appropriateness of the change to their area of the codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code reviewers comment on aspects of code quality, including design, functionality, complexity, testing, naming, comment quality, and code style, as documented by the various language-specific Google style guides.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#FNE&quot;&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Google has written a code-review tool called Critique that allows the reviewer to view the evolution of the code and comment on any line of the change. It encourages further revisions and a conversation leading to a final &quot;Looks Good To Me&quot; from the reviewer, indicating the review is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google's static analysis system (Tricorder&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#R10&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) and presubmit infrastructure also provide data on code quality, test coverage, and test results automatically in the Google code-review tool. These computationally intensive checks are triggered periodically, as well as when a code change is sent for review. Tricorder also provides suggested fixes with one-click code editing for many errors. These systems provide important data to increase the effectiveness of code reviews and keep the Google codebase healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team of Google developers will occasionally undertake a set of wide-reaching code-cleanup changes to further maintain the health of the codebase. The developers who perform these changes commonly separate them into two phases. With this approach, a large backward-compatible change is made first. Once it is complete, a second smaller change can be made to remove the original pattern that is no longer referenced. A Google tool called Rosie&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#FNF&quot;&gt;f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; supports the first phase of such large-scale cleanups and code changes. With Rosie, developers create a large patch, either through a find-and-replace operation across the entire repository or through more complex refactoring tools. Rosie then takes care of splitting the large patch into smaller patches, testing them independently, sending them out for code review, and committing them automatically once they pass tests and a code review. Rosie splits patches along project directory lines, relying on the code-ownership hierarchy described earlier to send patches to the appropriate reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#F7&quot;&gt;Figure 7&lt;/a&gt; reports the number of changes committed through Rosie on a monthly basis, demonstrating the importance of Rosie as a tool for performing large-scale code changes at Google. Using Rosie is balanced against the cost incurred by teams needing to review the ongoing stream of simple changes Rosie generates. As Rosie's popularity and usage grew, it became clear some control had to be established to limit Rosie's use to high-value changes that would be distributed to many reviewers, rather than to single atomic changes or rejected. In 2013, Google adopted a formal large-scale change-review process that led to a decrease in the number of commits through Rosie from 2013 to 2014. In evaluating a Rosie change, the review committee balances the benefit of the change against the costs of reviewer time and repository churn. We later examine this and similar trade-offs more closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum, Google has developed a number of practices and tools to support its enormous monolithic codebase, including trunk-based development, the distributed source-code repository Piper, the workspace client CitC, and workflow-support-tools Critique, CodeSearch, Tricorder, and Rosie. We discuss the pros and cons of this model here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;totop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#PageTop&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section outlines and expands upon both the advantages of a monolithic codebase and the costs related to maintaining such a model at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages&lt;/strong&gt;. Supporting the ultra-large-scale of Google's codebase while maintaining good performance for tens of thousands of users is a challenge, but Google has embraced the monolithic model due to its compelling advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most important, it supports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;acm&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unified versioning, one source of truth;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensive code sharing and reuse;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplified dependency management;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atomic changes;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large-scale refactoring;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaboration across teams;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexible team boundaries and code ownership; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code visibility and clear tree structure providing implicit team namespacing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single repository provides unified versioning and a single source of truth. There is no confusion about which repository hosts the authoritative version of a file. If one team wants to depend on another team's code, it can depend on it directly. The Google codebase includes a wealth of useful libraries, and the monolithic repository leads to extensive code sharing and reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Google build system&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#R5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; makes it easy to include code across directories, simplifying dependency management. Changes to the dependencies of a project trigger a rebuild of the dependent code. Since all code is versioned in the same repository, there is only ever one version of the truth, and no concern about independent versioning of dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most notably, the model allows Google to avoid the &quot;diamond dependency&quot; problem (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#F8&quot;&gt;Figure 8&lt;/a&gt;) that occurs when A depends on B and C, both B and C depend on D, but B requires version D.1 and C requires version D.2. In most cases it is now impossible to build A. For the base library D, it can become very difficult to release a new version without causing breakage, since all its callers must be updated at the same time. Updating is difficult when the library callers are hosted in different repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the open source world, dependencies are commonly broken by library updates, and finding library versions that all work together can be a challenge. Updating the versions of dependencies can be painful for developers, and delays in updating create technical debt that can become very expensive. In contrast, with a monolithic source tree it makes sense, and is easier, for the person updating a library to update all affected dependencies at the same time. The technical debt incurred by dependent systems is paid down immediately as changes are made. Changes to base libraries are instantly propagated through the dependency chain into the final products that rely on the libraries, without requiring a separate sync or migration step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the diamond-dependency problem can exist at the source/API level, as described here, as well as between binaries.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#R12&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; At Google, the binary problem is avoided through use of static linking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to make atomic changes is also a very powerful feature of the monolithic model. A developer can make a major change touching hundreds or thousands of files across the repository in a single consistent operation. For instance, a developer can rename a class or function in a single commit and yet not break any builds or tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The availability of all source code in a single repository, or at least on a centralized server, makes it easier for the maintainers of core libraries to perform testing and performance benchmarking for high-impact changes before they are committed. This approach is useful for exploring and measuring the value of highly disruptive changes. One concrete example is an experiment to evaluate the feasibility of converting Google data centers to support non-x86 machine architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the monolithic structure of the Google repository, a developer never has to decide where the repository boundaries lie. Engineers never need to &quot;fork&quot; the development of a shared library or merge across repositories to update copied versions of code. Team boundaries are fluid. When project ownership changes or plans are made to consolidate systems, all code is already in the same repository. This environment makes it easy to do gradual refactoring and reorganization of the codebase. The change to move a project and update all dependencies can be applied atomically to the repository, and the development history of the affected code remains intact and available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another attribute of a monolithic repository is the layout of the codebase is easily understood, as it is organized in a single tree. Each team has a directory structure within the main tree that effectively serves as a project's own namespace. Each source file can be uniquely identified by a single string—a file path that optionally includes a revision number. Browsing the codebase, it is easy to understand how any source file fits into the big picture of the repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Google codebase is constantly evolving. More complex codebase modernization efforts (such as updating it to C++11 or rolling out performance optimizations&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#R9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) are often managed centrally by dedicated codebase maintainers. Such efforts can touch half a million variable declarations or function-call sites spread across hundreds of thousands of files of source code. Because all projects are centrally stored, teams of specialists can do this work for the entire company, rather than require many individuals to develop their own tools, techniques, or expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example of how these benefits play out, consider Google's Compiler team, which ensures developers at Google employ the most up-to-date toolchains and benefit from the latest improvements in generated code and &quot;debuggability.&quot; The monolithic repository provides the team with full visibility of how various languages are used at Google and allows them to do codebase-wide cleanups to prevent changes from breaking builds or creating issues for developers. This greatly simplifies compiler validation, thus reducing compiler release cycles and making it possible for Google to safely do regular compiler releases (typically more than 20 per year for the C++ compilers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the data generated by performance and regression tests run on nightly builds of the entire Google codebase, the Compiler team tunes default compiler settings to be optimal. For example, due to this centralized effort, Google's Java developers all saw their garbage collection (GC) CPU consumption decrease by more than 50% and their GC pause time decrease by 10%–40% from 2014 to 2015. In addition, when software errors are discovered, it is often possible for the team to add new warnings to prevent reoccurrence. In conjunction with this change, they scan the entire repository to find and fix other instances of the software issue being addressed, before turning to new compiler errors. Having the compiler-reject patterns that proved problematic in the past is a significant boost to Google's overall code health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storing all source code in a common version-control repository allows codebase maintainers to efficiently analyze and change Google's source code. Tools like Refaster&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#R11&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and ClangMR&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#R15&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (often used in conjunction with Rosie) make use of the monolithic view of Google's source to perform high-level transformations of source code. The monolithic codebase captures all dependency information. Old APIs can be removed with confidence, because it can be proven that all callers have been migrated to new APIs. A single common repository vastly simplifies these tools by ensuring atomicity of changes and a single global view of the entire repository at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;/&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;An important aspect of Google culture that encourages code quality is the expectation that all code is reviewed before being committed to the repository.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Costs and trade-offs&lt;/strong&gt;. While important to note a monolithic codebase in no way implies monolithic software design, working with this model involves some downsides, as well as trade-offs, that must be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These costs and trade-offs fall into three categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;acm&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tooling investments for both development and execution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Codebase complexity, including unnecessary dependencies and difficulties with code discovery; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effort invested in code health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many ways the monolithic repository yields simpler tooling since there is only one system of reference for tools working with source. However, it is also necessary that tooling scale to the size of the repository. For instance, Google has written a custom plug-in for the Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE) to make working with a massive codebase possible from the IDE. Google's code-indexing system supports static analysis, cross-referencing in the code-browsing tool, and rich IDE functionality for Emacs, Vim, and other development environments. These tools require ongoing investment to manage the ever-increasing scale of the Google codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the investment in building and maintaining scalable tooling, Google must also cover the cost of running these systems, some of which are very computationally intensive. Much of Google's internal suite of developer tools, including the automated test infrastructure and highly scalable build infrastructure, are critical for supporting the size of the monolithic codebase. It is thus necessary to make trade-offs concerning how frequently to run this tooling to balance the cost of execution vs. the benefit of the data provided to developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monolithic model makes it easier to understand the structure of the codebase, as there is no crossing of repository boundaries between dependencies. However, as the scale increases, code discovery can become more difficult, as standard tools like &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; bog down. Developers must be able to explore the codebase, find relevant libraries, and see how to use them and who wrote them. Library authors often need to see how their APIs are being used. This requires a significant investment in code search and browsing tools. However, Google has found this investment highly rewarding, improving the productivity of all developers, as described in more detail by Sadowski et al.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#R9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access to the whole codebase encourages extensive code sharing and reuse. Some would argue this model, which relies on the extreme scalability of the Google build system, makes it too easy to add dependencies and reduces the incentive for software developers to produce stable and well-thought-out APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the ease of creating dependencies, it is common for teams to not think about their dependency graph, making code cleanup more error-prone. Unnecessary dependencies can increase project exposure to downstream build breakages, lead to binary size bloating, and create additional work in building and testing. In addition, lost productivity ensues when abandoned projects that remain in the repository continue to be updated and maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several efforts at Google have sought to rein in unnecessary dependencies. Tooling exists to help identify and remove unused dependencies, or dependencies linked into the product binary for historical or accidental reasons, that are not needed. Tooling also exists to identify underutilized dependencies, or dependencies on large libraries that are mostly unneeded, as candidates for refactoring.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#R7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; One such tool, Clipper, relies on a custom Java compiler to generate an accurate cross-reference index. It then uses the index to construct a reachability graph and determine what classes are never used. Clipper is useful in guiding dependency-refactoring efforts by finding targets that are relatively easy to remove or break up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;/&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A developer can make a major change touching hundreds or thousands of files across the repository in a single consistent operation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dependency-refactoring and cleanup tools are helpful, but, ideally, code owners should be able to prevent unwanted dependencies from being created in the first place. In 2011, Google started relying on the concept of API visibility, setting the default visibility of new APIs to &quot;private.&quot; This forces developers to explicitly mark APIs as appropriate for use by other teams. A lesson learned from Google's experience with a large monolithic repository is such mechanisms should be put in place as soon as possible to encourage more hygienic dependency structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that most Google code is available to all Google developers has led to a culture where some teams expect other developers to read their code rather than providing them with separate user documentation. There are pros and cons to this approach. No effort goes toward writing or keeping documentation up to date, but developers sometimes read more than the API code and end up relying on underlying implementation details. This behavior can create a maintenance burden for teams that then have trouble deprecating features they never meant to expose to users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model also requires teams to collaborate with one another when using open source code. An area of the repository is reserved for storing open source code (developed at Google or externally). To prevent dependency conflicts, as outlined earlier, it is important that only one version of an open source project be available at any given time. Teams that use open source software are expected to occasionally spend time upgrading their codebase to work with newer versions of open source libraries when library upgrades are performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google invests significant effort in maintaining code health to address some issues related to codebase complexity and dependency management. For instance, special tooling automatically detects and removes dead code, splits large refactorings and automatically assigns code reviews (as through Rosie), and marks APIs as deprecated. Human effort is required to run these tools and manage the corresponding large-scale code changes. A cost is also incurred by teams that need to review an ongoing stream of simple refactorings resulting from codebase-wide clean-ups and centralized modernization efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;totop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#PageTop&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Alternatives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the popularity and use of distributed version control systems (DVCSs) like Git have grown, Google has considered whether to move from Piper to Git as its primary version-control system. A team at Google is focused on supporting Git, which is used by Google's Android and Chrome teams outside the main Google repository. The use of Git is important for these teams due to external partner and open source collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Git community strongly suggests and prefers developers have more and smaller repositories. A Git-clone operation requires copying all content to one's local machine, a procedure incompatible with a large repository. To move to Git-based source hosting, it would be necessary to split Google's repository into thousands of separate repositories to achieve reasonable performance. Such reorganization would necessitate cultural and workflow changes for Google's developers. As a comparison, Google's Git-hosted Android codebase is divided into more than 800 separate repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the value gained from the existing tools Google has built and the many advantages of the monolithic codebase structure, it is clear that moving to more and smaller repositories would not make sense for Google's main repository. The alternative of moving to Git or any other DVCS that would require repository splitting is not compelling for Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current investment by the Google source team focuses primarily on the ongoing reliability, scalability, and security of the in-house source systems. The team is also pursuing an experimental effort with Mercurial,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#FNG&quot;&gt;g&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; an open source DVCS similar to Git. The goal is to add scalability features to the Mercurial client so it can efficiently support a codebase the size of Google's. This would provide Google's developers with an alternative of using popular DVCS-style workflows in conjunction with the central repository. This effort is in collaboration with the open source Mercurial community, including contributors from other companies that value the monolithic source model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;totop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#PageTop&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google chose the monolithic-source-management strategy in 1999 when the existing Google codebase was migrated from CVS to Perforce. Early Google engineers maintained that a single repository was strictly better than splitting up the codebase, though at the time they did not anticipate the future scale of the codebase and all the supporting tooling that would be built to make the scaling feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, as the investment required to continue scaling the centralized repository grew, Google leadership occasionally considered whether it would make sense to move from the monolithic model. Despite the effort required, Google repeatedly chose to stick with the central repository due to its advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monolithic model of source code management is not for everyone. It is best suited to organizations like Google, with an open and collaborative culture. It would not work well for organizations where large parts of the codebase are private or hidden between groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Google, we have found, with some investment, the monolithic model of source management can scale successfully to a codebase with more than one billion files, 35 million commits, and thousands of users around the globe. As the scale and complexity of projects both inside and outside Google continue to grow, we hope the analysis and workflow described in this article can benefit others weighing decisions on the long-term structure for their codebases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm curious to understand the interplay of the source code model (monolithic repository vs many repositories) and the deployment model, in particular when considering continuous deployment vs. explicit releases.&lt;br/&gt;- My understanding is that Google services are compiled&amp;amp;deployed from trunk; what does this mean for database migrations (e.g., schema upgrades), in particular when different instances of the same service are maintained by different teams: How do you coordinate such distributed data migrations in the face of more or less continuous upgrades of binaries? There there isn't a notion of a released, stable version of a package, do you require effectively infinite backwards-compatibility?&lt;br/&gt;- Similarly, when a service is deployed from today's trunk, but a dependent service is still running on last week's trunk, how is API compatibility guaranteed between those services?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that stringent contracts for cross-service API and schema compatibility need to be in place to prevent breakages as a result from live upgrades?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious to hear your thoughts, thanks!&lt;br/&gt;Robert&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teams can package up their own binaries that run in production data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is effectively a SLA between the team that publish the binary and the clients that uses them. If you don't like the SLA (including backwards compatibility), you are free to compile your own binary package to run in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migration is usually done in a three step process: announce, new code and move over, then deprecate old code by deletion.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>To Remember, the Brain Must Actively Forget</title>
<link>https://www.quantamagazine.org/to-remember-the-brain-must-actively-forget-20180724/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.quantamagazine.org/to-remember-the-brain-must-actively-forget-20180724/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Going along with all that variety is now a growing appreciation that forgetting — the functional loss of memories — may also come in diverse forms. Past theories about forgetting mostly emphasized relatively passive processes in which the loss of memories was a consequence of the physical traces of those memories (what some researchers refer to as “engrams”) naturally breaking down or becoming harder to access; those engrams may typically be interconnections between brain cells that prompt them to fire in a certain way. This forgetting process could involve the spontaneous decay of connections between neurons that encode a memory, the random death of those neurons, the failure of systems that would normally help to consolidate and stabilize new memories, or the loss of context cues or other factors that might make it hard to retrieve a memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, however, researchers are paying much more attention to mechanisms that actively erase or hide those memory engrams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intrinsic Forgetting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One form of active forgetting that scientists formally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30498-1&quot;&gt;identified in 2017&lt;/a&gt; is called intrinsic forgetting. It involves a certain subset of cells in the brain — which &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripps.edu/davis/&quot;&gt;Ronald Davis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://life.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/smkx/11529/2018/20180519052257296107340/20180519052257296107340_.html&quot;&gt;Yi Zhong&lt;/a&gt;, who wrote the paper that introduced the idea, casually call “forgetting cells” — that degrade the engrams in memory cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea emerged after Davis, a neuroscientist at the Scripps Research Institute in Jupiter, Florida, and his colleagues reported giving fruit flies mild electric shocks while exposing them to an odor. The flies quickly &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2016.05.010&quot;&gt;learned to avoid the smell&lt;/a&gt;, associating it with the shock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Davis and his colleagues looked at a certain set of neurons in the brains of the fruit flies that continuously release the neurotransmitter dopamine onto others called mushroom body neurons. They found that dopamine plays a dual role in both forming and forgetting memories. After Davis and his colleagues trained the flies, they blocked dopamine release onto the mushroom body cells and found that the flies’ memory scores were twice as high when they were tested three hours later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explanation that Davis and his team proposed is that after a new memory forms, the dopamine-based forgetting mechanism begins to erase it. Davis thinks this erasure happens because the cells reverse the structural changes that created the memory engram. The cells’ natural inclination is to go back to how they were before they learned the memory — that is, unless the thought is somehow recognized as being important. Then the engram is preserved through some sort of consolidation process, which maintains a balance between what is learned and forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Maybe the brain is designed to forget information,” Davis said. Somewhere in the brain, he noted, there may be some sort of judge that tells it to override the forgetting process when it comes across something worth remembering in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhong, a neuroscientist at Tsinghua University in Beijing, and his team have also successfully manipulated forgetting in mice. &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2016.06.056&quot;&gt;In 2016 they found&lt;/a&gt; that the inhibition of a specific protein called Rac1 in the hippocampal neurons prolonged the retention of memories from less than 72 hours to at least 120 hours in many cases. Increasing the activity of Rac1 reduced the life of memories to less than 24 hours. Earlier work by Zhong’s group had shown that Rac1 was similarly involved in &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.cell.2009.12.044&quot;&gt;several forms of forgetting&lt;/a&gt; in fruit flies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Davis and Zhong argued in &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2017.05.039&quot;&gt;their jointly written 2017 review&lt;/a&gt;, all those findings suggested that cellular processes mediated by dopamine and Rac1 constantly erode newly formed memories. “From this perspective,” they wrote, “forgetting as mediated by intrinsic forgetting mechanisms may be the default state of the brain; intrinsic forgetting may operate chronically at a low level to slowly remove each newly acquired memory, although its strength may be regulated by internal or external factors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Neurons and Old Memories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another cellular process that seems to cause its own form of forgetting is neurogenesis, the birth of new neurons in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The connection of neurogenesis to memory and forgetting is complicated. Previous studies have shown that neurogenesis can be important to the formation of new memories: In tests on lab animals, drugs that inhibit neurogenesis in the hippocampus can interfere with new memory formation, and drugs that enhance neurogenesis seem to help with learning new tasks if they are given before the learning process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the effects aren’t all positive for memory, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neuroscience.utoronto.ca/faculty/list/frankland.htm&quot;&gt;Paul Frankland&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroscientist at the University of Toronto and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.franklandlab.com/&quot;&gt;Hospital for Sick Children&lt;/a&gt;, and his colleagues &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/344/6184/598.long&quot;&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; while working with mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tins.2013.05.002&quot;&gt;In their experiment&lt;/a&gt;, they first allowed the mice to create a memory by training at a task. Hours later, with drugs, they raised the level of neurogenesis in the animals to test whether the integration of new neurons in the hippocampus would affect the stability of that already stored memory. When Frankland’s team tested the mice about a month later, their recall of the training was much worse than that of mice that had not had the later neurogenesis boost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankland suspects that neurogenesis can complicate the challenge of retrieving prior memories from the hippocampus. If the added neural wiring overlaps with the circuitry holding older memories, it may damage the older engrams or make it harder to isolate the old memories from newer ones. He likened the problem to electronics repair: “If you go in and start rewiring something,” Frankland said, “any information stored in that circuit might be degraded.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One piece of evidence that supports his theory came from follow-up work &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3126-17.2018&quot;&gt;published earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; which showed that the harmful effect of hippocampal neurogenesis is worse for relatively recent memories. Much older memories do not seem to be hurt by it. Frankland’s explanation is that older memories are less sensitive to this effect because the brain gradually transfers important memories from the hippocampus to the cortex for long-term storage. Neurogenesis in the hippocampus today is therefore more disruptive for memories from a week ago than for those from months or years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Frankland noted that the forgetting produced by remodeling of the hippocampal circuits through neurogenesis happens more slowly than the intrinsic forgetting based on dopamine and Rac1 that Davis and Yi observed: It takes several weeks for newly formed neurons to create new connections — and to contribute to the forgetting processes at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Happens to Forgotten Memories?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When memories are forgotten by whatever mechanism, what happens to them? Are all traces of them eliminated? Or do they persist in some form unavailable to us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A set of answers that seems to apply to at least some types of memory came from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29246980&quot;&gt;work published last year&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.dom.edu/departments/neuroscience/faculty/robert-calin-jageman&quot;&gt;Robert Calin-Jageman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.dom.edu/departments/biologicalsciences/faculty/irina-calin-jageman&quot;&gt;Irina Calin-Jageman&lt;/a&gt;, husband-and-wife researchers who run a &lt;a href=&quot;https://calin-jageman.homeip.net/lab/&quot;&gt;behavioral neuroscience laboratory at Dominican University&lt;/a&gt; in River Forest, Illinois. The pair, who have been studying how sea slugs form memories for a decade, recently switched their attention to the neurobiology of how the animals forget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first stage of their experiments, the Calin-Jagemans “sensitized” sea slugs to electric shocks on one side of their body, but not on the other. In effect, they taught the sea slugs to show a bigger reflexive response on the trained side of their body. They then let the sea slugs forget this learned response over a one-week rest period, so that their responses to shocks were symmetrical again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the researchers jogged the sea slugs’ memory with another round of moderate shocks. The day after this reminder, they saw that the side of the animals that had previously been sensitized was again reacting more than the untrained side. This difference showed that some fragment of the memory persisted in the animal’s brain. “The animal has changed its behavior because the nervous system has encoded that previous painful experience,” according to Robert Calin-Jageman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that there was some fragment of the previous sensitization memory still existing on the trained side,” he said, which hinted “that there must have been something latent in the brain” that preserved the association. Even after a week — a significant part of a sea slug’s one-year lifespan — the brain is still not back to the way it was before it acquired the memory. “Our results support the idea that it’s not just passive decay of memories,” said Irina Calin-Jageman. “Everything isn’t just gradually, completely gone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out more about what survived the forgetting process, the Calin-Jagemans and their colleagues looked at gene expression on both sides of the animals’ brains, paying particular attention to about 1,200 genes that previous research had linked to memory storage in sea slugs. Eleven of those genes, they discovered, were still active on one side of the animals’ brains but not on the other, even after the animals had apparently forgotten about the shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why those 11 genes were active and what function they were serving are still unknowns. It’s not even certain that their activity directly relates to the forgotten memory; researchers would have to manipulate these genes to find out. But the possibility that excites the Calin-Jagemans is that those genes were connected to the memory — either in maintaining some remnant of the engram or in erasing it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Departing Facebook security officer advocated for shifts in company’s culture</title>
<link>https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-alex-stamos-memo-cambridge-analytica-pick-sides</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-alex-stamos-memo-cambridge-analytica-pick-sides</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Stamos only vaguely alluded to such clashes in his note, stating he’s “had passionate discussions with other execs” without elaborating further on whom those conversations were with or what they were specifically about. And while his note does not directly mention Zuckerberg, it’s clear that some of the directives are meant for the Facebook CEO, particularly those around de-emphasizing growth and revenue and making the company’s products less invasive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stamos's impassioned rhetoric and laundry list of problems Facebook needs to tackle make his departure at this crucial moment in the company's history all the more remarkable. For some familiar with the company's current culture, there is concern that Facebook is losing a voice of reason at just the wrong time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it's really important at any company to have folks inside who challenge the status quo,” a former senior employee told BuzzFeed News. “With Facebook's complexity, you need people who can stand up and advocate. Alex has a tremendous depth of expertise and reputation — he's the person you'd want in your corner to help get the company on track. If you didn't want him, who else would you want? It’s a big loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Difficult Week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex Stamos, Friday, March 23, 2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At noon on Monday, a NY Times reporter I have long known and respected gave me a ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“Alex, this will probably be the most difficult discussion we’ve ever had.” She was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She told me that four anonymous sources had told her a variety of things that she was working into one story that would post later that day. I spent the next thirty minutes shooting down several completely false accusations and trying to prevent the true facts from being woven into a misleading narrative. I pointed out to her that, if true, her story would still be a scoop in several days and asked if she could me and Facebook more time to work with them to tell an accurate tale of our challenging last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About three hours later, with me frantically working with our comms team to get on-the-record quotes to the reporters, the first stub version of the story went out with a headline that implied that I had just quit Facebook out of anger. This led to thousands of tweets and hundreds of stories based upon the initial, incomplete report, as well as a tearful call from my mother who thought I had been fired. The original NY Times headlines and story were corrected several times, but despite our outreach to other outlets the initial framing calcified into conventional wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some fact checking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Did you quit?&lt;/strong&gt; Look up, is my name greyed out? If not, then I’m still a Facebook employee (or our deprovisioning process really needs some work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At some point, I will leave, and this answer will become a bit ironic, but it is absolutely untrue that I quit on Monday, and today I’m still trying to do my best by our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you had passionate discussions with other execs?&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Have we met?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have those disagreements been about investigating or disclosing Russian activity?&lt;/strong&gt; The world has changed from underneath us in many ways. One change has been the thrusting of private tech companies into the struggle between nation-states. Traditionally, the standard has been to report malicious activity by adversary nations to US law enforcement. We are moving into a world where the major platforms are going to be expected to provide our findings, attribution and data directly to the public, making us a visible participant in the battle between cyberwarfare titans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an uncomfortable transition, and have not always agree with the compromises we have struck in the process. That being said, I believe my colleagues have all approached the process in good faith, and together we have sorted through legitimate equities that needed to be weighed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did Sheryl tell you not to investigate or disclose Russian activity?&lt;/strong&gt; Absolutely not. I have rejected this claim, on-the-record, multiple times to multiple reporters and on Twitter. Unfortunately, we are living in a media moment where sometimes an anonymous accusation is printed over the on-record denial of a direct participant. The Times, to their credit, removed a paragraph that had been written before my on-record statement had been provided, which has become its own meta-controversy (/sound inception_trombone.mp3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Was there a reorganization of the security team?&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, here is my post announcing that in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you leaving in August because of this change?&lt;/strong&gt; I initiated the discussion of changing the structure of the InfoSec team just before Thanksgiving 2017. This was due to my concerns that organizational issues impaired our election security work in 2016. While the outcome of this discussion was not one I proposed, at the time I committed myself to making the transition as smooth as possible and trying to set the new teams up for success. I am genuinely proud of the capable, diverse security teams we have built and I truly want my colleagues to continue to be successful in their vital work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The re-org, did, however, leave me with a challenge, in that it created a big mismatch between the responsibilities I felt carrying the Chief Security Officer title and the potential for big impact I could have from my redefined role. This conundrum was pretty obvious to many, and when people internally asked if I was leaving I rather openly told them that I was committed to staying through August. That was the truth; I had not made up my mind to leave, and I thought setting a date eight months in the future was responsible and reassuring about the stability of the team. Unfortunately, somebody leaked the fact in a manner meant to turn an eight-month commitment into a rage-quitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you leaving because of Cambridge Analytica?&lt;/strong&gt; No, that makes no sense if your look at the calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How are you feeling?&lt;/strong&gt; Aww, how sweet, thanks for asking! I feel like shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am extremely uncomfortable with the “heroic Alex” narrative the media is using to beat up on Facebook for many reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. It is undeserved.&lt;/strong&gt; I was the Chief Security Officer during the 2016 election season, and I deserve as much blame (or more) as any other exec at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. It erases the work of the true heroes&lt;/strong&gt;. If anybody deserves credit for the good things we did, it is the members of the threat intelligence team who first spotted and stopped Russian activity in 2016, and the huge cross-functional group who really studied and understood this problem in 2017. Just because I approve the expense reports of the first group and was part of the second does not give me any special virtue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Heroes need villains.&lt;/strong&gt; This narrative is popular not because people like me, but because it harms Facebook. At least one person seems to be trying specifically to hurt Sheryl by mixing in leaked facts with untrue allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. The media loves to build up heroes before tearing them down&lt;/strong&gt;. We Greeks invented this narrative device, the fatal flaw, and I know that at least one person is pushing lies about me to journalists. Aside from this being hurtful on a personal scale, I realize that the more I’m narratively built up, the further the media eventually gets to pull me down (which they will also frame as bad for Facebook).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most importantly, this narrative absolves us of the hard things we have to do to win back the world’s trust. It would be really simple to believe that the outcomes of arguments between a handful of people got us to this point, but the truth is that we need to all own this. The problem the company is facing today are due to tens of thousands of small decisions made over the last decade within an incentive structure that was not predicated on our 2018 threat profile. While it has been disconcerting to hear anger and sadness in the voices of our colleagues this week, I also take heart in how widespread our desire has become to align ourselves in the new landscape. I saw this shift in many executives last year, as they clearly recognized the emerging imperatives to prioritize security, safety, integrity and trust over all else, but no number of all-hands or corporate goals was going to be able turn this huge ship without a bottom-up change in culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So now we need to turn that angst into action. We need to &lt;strong&gt;change the metrics&lt;/strong&gt; we measure and the goals we shoot for. We need to adjust PSC to &lt;strong&gt;reward not shipping&lt;/strong&gt; when that is the wiser decision. We need to &lt;strong&gt;think adversarially&lt;/strong&gt; in every process, product and engineering decision we make. We need to build a user experience that &lt;strong&gt;conveys honesty and respect,&lt;/strong&gt; not one optimized to get people to click yes to giving us more access. We need to intentionally &lt;strong&gt;not collect data&lt;/strong&gt; where possible, and to keep it &lt;strong&gt;only as long as we are using it&lt;/strong&gt; to serve people. We need to &lt;strong&gt;find and stop adversaries&lt;/strong&gt; who will be copying the playbook they saw in 2016. We need to &lt;strong&gt;listen to people&lt;/strong&gt; (including internally) when they tell us a feature is creepy or point out a negative impact we are having in the world. We need to &lt;strong&gt;deprioritze short-term growth&lt;/strong&gt; and revenue and to explain to Wall Street why that is ok. We need to &lt;strong&gt;be willing to pick sides&lt;/strong&gt; when there are clear moral or humanitarian issues. And we need to be &lt;strong&gt;open, honest and transparent&lt;/strong&gt; about challenges and what we are doing to fix them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have heard all of these changes discussed among executives over the last year, and I think we’re in a place where such aims are realistic and achievable. If any company is up to these challenges, it’s ours. I still can’t believe how lucky I am to work with talented people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alex, blink twice if you are being held hostage as you write this.&lt;/strong&gt; I wrote this post myself, and did not run it by anyone. I have to thank Schrep for pulling me aside, asking how I am and suggesting that I speak to the company from my heart, but he has not seen or endorsed this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now what? Are you staying?&lt;/strong&gt; I honestly don’t know. My standard for any job has been whether I am being effective in my position, true to my beliefs, and present for my family. My fear is that stories like this one can become self-fulling, and my ability to represent the company publicly has been compromised by this cloud hanging over my head. To the last criteria, I have three children under twelve and I’ve come to the realization that I’ve spent 75% of my youngest child’s life as the CISO of companies in battle with the Russian intelligence services. This isn’t conducive to being a great parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If I do leave, I promise to be open and honest. Wherever I am, I am always available to anybody looking to discuss how to tackle these problems or who have thoughts on what I can do better. Thank you to everybody who has been kind to me, especially this week.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17513576&quot;&gt;A post about summer reading&lt;/a&gt; on Hacker News inspired us to put a list together for 2018. Here’s what we’ve been reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Path-Power-Years-Lyndon-Johnson/dp/0679729453&quot;&gt;The Years of Lyndon Johnson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As in many of the best books of history I’ve read, the author (Caro) makes an argument larger than LBJ and tells a story that can’t be encompassed by any one person or sequence of events. His writing is some of the best I’ve read. His analysis of the man, his time, and the structure of power shifted the way I look at the world.” &lt;strong&gt;– Aaron Harris&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A powerful memoir about loss, grief, and the fluidity of sanity, obsession, and madness. Macdonald’s descriptions of the world and of her mind blur the line between poetry and prose.” &lt;strong&gt;– Aaron Harris&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Looking Glass – A new type of holographic interface</title>
<link>https://www.feld.com/archives/2018/07/the-holographic-display-of-the-future-is-here.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.feld.com/archives/2018/07/the-holographic-display-of-the-future-is-here.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The holographic display of the future is here and &lt;a href=&quot;http://look.glass/brad&quot;&gt;you can have one on your desk for under $600&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since I saw Princess Leia appealing to Obi Wan that he was her only hope when I was 11, I’ve wanted a holographic display. Movies like Minority Report and Back to the Future II (do you remember &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/d68yRIE9OvQ?t=66&quot;&gt;the shark hologram that ate Marty&lt;/a&gt;?) have consumed thousands of people’s lives over the past few decades. But until now, no one has been able to make a scalable device that would let groups of people, unaided by a VR or AR headset, see and touch a living and moving 3D world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s changing today with &lt;a href=&quot;http://look.glass/brad&quot;&gt;the launch of the Looking Glass&lt;/a&gt;, a new type of interface that achieves that dream of the hologram we’ve been promised for so long. The Looking Glass is technically a lightfield and volumetric display hybrid, but that’s pretty nerdy-sounding. I like to just call it a holographic display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a technology at the Apple II stage, designed for the creators and hackers of the world — specifically 3D creators in this case. If you’ve ever played with a MakerBot or Form 2, have a Structure sensor in your backpack, know what volumetric video is, or have 3D creation programs like Maya, Unity, or Blender on your computer, then you should get a Looking Glass. You can holographically preview 3D prints before you print them, experiment with volumetric video recording and playback, or create entirely new and weird applications in Unity that can live inside of the Looking Glass. And when I say weird I mean it — the founders Shawn and Alex put a 3D scan of me inside and gave me some new dance moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://look.glass/brad&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-14799&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/www.feld.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/brad-in-looking-glass-1.gif?resize=477%2C268&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;477&quot; height=&quot;268&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://look.glass/brad&quot;&gt;Check out this video on their Kickstarter page&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve seen this in person and what is shown in the video is real. There aren’t any camera tricks going on – it really looks that good (actually a little better) in real life. The Looking Glass is indistinguishable from magic the way the best of technology strives to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know of many people who genuinely want &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/622083/the-future-is-here-and-it-looks-horrible/&quot;&gt;the dystopian future of everyone in VR all day long&lt;/a&gt;. Ok, I do know a few. But while VR may play a role, I think most people don’t want this 1984 vision of the future, where everyone is geared up 16 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team behind the Looking Glass is fighting against that all-headset future with this new class of technology. &lt;a href=&quot;http://look.glass/brad&quot;&gt;Join us!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Apple releases software fix for MacBook Pro slowdown</title>
<link>https://sixcolors.com/post/2018/07/apple-releases-software-fix-for-macbook-pro-slowdown/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://sixcolors.com/post/2018/07/apple-releases-software-fix-for-macbook-pro-slowdown/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;column1&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;By Jason Snell&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;dateline&quot;&gt;July 24, 2018 10:00 AM PT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column2&quot; readability=&quot;42.105517241379&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sixcolors.com/images/content/2018/macbook-speed-2018-6c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a week of controversy following the posting of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx8J125s4cg&quot;&gt;a video that claimed the new 15-inch MacBook Pro could experience massive slowdowns&lt;/a&gt;, Apple on Tuesday acknowledged that the slowdowns exist—and that they’re caused by a bug in the thermal management software of all the 2018 MacBook Pro models. That bug has been fixed in a software update that Apple says it’s pushing out to all 2018 MacBook Pro users as of Tuesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the official Apple statement, furnished to Six Colors by an Apple spokesperson:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following extensive performance testing under numerous workloads, we’ve identified that there is a missing digital key in the firmware that impacts the thermal management system and could drive clock speeds down under heavy thermal loads on the new MacBook Pro. A bug fix is included in today’s macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 Supplemental Update and is recommended. We apologize to any customer who has experienced less than optimal performance on their new systems. Customers can expect the new 15-inch MacBook Pro to be up to 70% faster, and the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar to be up to 2X faster, as shown in the performance results on our website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After YouTuber Dave Lee posted his video showing his new Core i9 MacBook Pro slowing to a crawl while exporting video from Adobe Premiere, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2018/07/18/how-macbook-pro-throttles-with-final-cut-pro-x/&quot;&gt;reports that the processor on the new MacBook Pros was being throttled all the way down to 800MHz&lt;/a&gt;, the company launched an investigation (and contacted Lee for more information about his specific project and settings). Apple’s own internal performance testing hadn’t triggered the issue, which turns out to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be app specific—Premiere, you’re out of the penalty box—and tends to affect heavy workloads that take place over an extended period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is, this doesn’t appear to be evidence that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1019610632218439686&quot;&gt;Apple’s laptop design is incapable of handling fast chips&lt;/a&gt;, but that someone at Apple had a bad day and failed to include a specific digital key that caused a cascade of bad behaviors in some very specific circumstances. (All laptops throttle the performance of processors in order to regulate temperature, of course, but it’s not supposed to happen to anywhere near the extent seen in Lee’s video.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1973?locale=en_US&quot;&gt;Tuesday’s Supplemental Update&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t seem to have any impact on performance—all of Apple’s previous claims (up to 70 percent of a speed boost on the 15-inch model versus last year’s version, and 2x the performance on the 13-inch compared to last year’s model) are still accurate. When given an opportunity to re-run his tests after applying the fix, Lee should find that his MacBook Pro is now clearly faster than last year’s model.&lt;/p&gt;

<title> Google announces Cloud Build, its new continuous integration platform</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/24/google-announces-cloud-build-its-new-continuous-integration-continuous-delivery-platform/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/24/google-announces-cloud-build-its-new-continuous-integration-continuous-delivery-platform/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It used to be that developers built applications with long lead times and development cycles. There was always plenty of time to prepare, but in today’s continuous delivery/continuous deployment (CI/CD) world, new versions could be going out every day. That requires a CI/CD framework, and today at &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/google/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;google&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; Next in San Francisco, the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/&quot;&gt;announced Cloud Build, its new CI/CD framework&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Google describes it, Cloud Build is the company’s “fully-managed Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) platform that lets you build, test, and deploy software quickly, at scale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud Build works across a variety of environments including VMs, serverless, Kubernetes, or Firebase. What’s more it supports Docker containers and it gives developers or operations the flexibility to build, test and deploy in an increasingly automated fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google will allow you to use triggers to deploy, so that when certain conditions are met, the update will launch automatically. You can identify vulnerabilities in your packages before you deploy and you can build locally and deploy in the cloud if you so choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are problems, Cloud Build provides analytics and insights to let you debug via build errors and warnings and filter those warnings to easily identify slow builds or those with other issues you want to see before deploying live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google is offering a free version of Cloud Build with up to 120 build minutes per day at no cost. Additional build minutes will be billed at $0.0034 per minute.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>It used to be that developers built applications with long lead times and development cycles. There was always plenty of time to prepare, but in today’s continuous delivery/continuous deployment (CI/CD) world, new versions could be going out every day.

<description>&lt;p&gt;Dealing with Hard Problems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by Richard Rusczyk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A parent of one of our students wrote today about his daughter's occasional frustration with the difficulty of some of the problems in our courses. She does fantastic work in our courses, and was easily among the very top students in the class she took with me, and yet she still occasionally hits problems that she can't solve. Moreover, she has access to an excellent math teacher in her school who sometimes can't help her get past these problems, either. (This is no slight to him -- I have students bring me problems I can't solve, too!) Her question: &quot;Why does it have to be so hard?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ask hard questions because so many of the problems worth solving in life are hard. If they were easy, someone else would have solved them before you got to them. This is why college classes at top-tier universities have tests on which nearly no one clears 70%, much less gets a perfect score. They’re training future researchers, and the whole point of research is to find and answer questions that have never been solved. You can't learn how to do that without fighting with problems you can't solve. If you are consistently getting every problem in a class correct, you shouldn't be too happy -- it means you aren't learning efficiently enough. You need to find a harder class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with not being challenged sufficiently goes well beyond not learning math (or whatever) as quickly as you can. I think a lot of what we do at AoPS is preparing students for challenges well outside mathematics. The same sort of strategies that go into solving very difficult math problems can be used to tackle a great many problems. I believe we’re teaching students how to think, how to approach difficult problems, and that math happens to be the best way to do so for many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in dealing with difficult problems is to accept and understand their importance. Don't duck them. They will teach you a lot more than a worksheet full of easy problems. Brilliant &quot;Aha!&quot; moments almost always spring from minds cultivated by long periods of frustration. But without that frustration, those brilliant ideas never arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few strategies for dealing with hard problems, and the frustration that comes with them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do something&lt;/strong&gt;. Yeah, the problem is hard. Yeah, you have no idea what to do to solve it. At some point you have to stop staring and start trying stuff. Most of it won't work. Accept that a lot of your effort will appear to have been wasted. But there's a chance that one of your stabs will hit something, and even if it doesn't, the effort may prepare your mind for the winning idea when the time comes. We started developing an elementary school curriculum months and months before we had the idea that became &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beastacademy.com&quot;&gt;Beast Academy&lt;/a&gt;. Our lead curriculum developer wrote 100-200 pages of content, dreaming up lots of different styles and approaches we might use. Not a one of those pages will be in the final work, but they spurred a great many ideas for content we will use. Perhaps more importantly, it prepared us so that when we finally hit upon the Beast Academy idea, we were confident enough to pursue it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simplify the problem&lt;/strong&gt;. Try smaller numbers and special cases. Remove restrictions. Or add restrictions. Set your sights a little lower, then raise them once you tackle the simpler problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reflect on successes&lt;/strong&gt;. You've solved lots of problems. Some of them were even hard problems! How did you do it? Start with problems that are similar to the one you face, but even think about others that have nothing to do with your current problem. Think about the strategies you used to solve those problems, and you might stumble on the solution. A few months ago, I was playing around with some Project Euler problems, and I came upon a problem that (eventually) boiled down to generating integer solutions to c^2 = a^2 + b^2 + ab in an efficient manner. Number Theory is not my strength, but my path to the solution was to recall first the method for generating Pythagorean triples. Then, I thought about how to generate that method, and then, the path to the solution became clear. (I'm guessing some of our more mathematically advanced readers have so internalized the solution process for this type of Diophantine equation that you don't have to travel with Pythagoras to get there!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on what you haven't used yet&lt;/strong&gt;. Many problems (particularly geometry problems) have a lot of moving parts. Look back at the problem, and the discoveries you have made so far, and ask yourself, &quot;What haven't I used yet in any constructive way?&quot; The answer to that question is often the key to your next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work backwards&lt;/strong&gt;. This is particularly useful when trying to discover proofs. Instead of starting from what you know and working towards what you want, start from what you want, and ask yourself what you need to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask for help&lt;/strong&gt;. This is hard for many outstanding students. You're so used to getting everything right, to being the one everyone else asks, that it's hard to admit you need help. When I first got to MOP my sophomore year, I was in way over my head. I understood very little of anything that happened in class. I asked for help from the professor once -- it was very hard to get up the courage to do so. I didn't understand anything he told me during the 15 minutes he worked privately with me. I just couldn't admit it and ask for more help, so I stopped asking. I could have learned much, much more had I just been more willing to admit to people that I just didn't understand. (This is part of why our classes now have a feature that allows students to ask questions anonymously.) Get over it. You will get stuck. You will need help. And if you ask for it, you’ll get much farther than if you don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start early&lt;/strong&gt;. This doesn't help much with timed tests, but with the longer-range assignments that are parts of college and of life, it's essential. Don't wait until the last minute -- hard problems are hard enough without having to deal with time pressure. Moreover, complex ideas take a long time to understand fully. The people you know who seem wicked smart, and who seem to come up with ideas much faster than you possibly could, are often people who have simply thought about the issues for much longer than you have. I used this strategy throughout college to great success -- in the first few weeks of each semester, I worked far ahead in all of my classes. Therefore, by the end of the semester, I had been thinking about the key ideas for a lot longer than most of my classmates, making the exams and such at the end of the course a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take a break&lt;/strong&gt;. Get away from the problem for a bit. When you come back to it, you may find that you haven't entirely gotten away from the problem at all -- the background processes of your brain have continued plugging away, and you'll find yourself a lot closer to the solution. Of course, it’s a lot easier to take a break if you start early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start over&lt;/strong&gt;. Put all your earlier work aside, get a fresh sheet of paper, and try to start from scratch. Your other work will still be there if you want to draw from it later, and it may have prepared you to take advantage of insights you make in your second go-round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give up&lt;/strong&gt;. You won't solve them all. At some point, it’s time to cut your losses and move on. This is especially true when you’re in training, and trying to learn new things. A single difficult problem is usually going to teach you more in the first hour or two than it will in the next six, and there are a lot more problems to learn from. So, set yourself a time limit, and if you’re still hopelessly stuck at the end of it, then read the solutions and move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be introspective&lt;/strong&gt;. If you do give up and read the solution, then read it actively, not passively. As you read it, think about what clues in the problem could have led you to this solution. Think about what you did wrong in your investigation. If there are math facts in the solution that you don't understand, then go investigate. I was completely befuddled the first time I saw a bunch of stuff about &quot;mod&quot;s in an olympiad solution -- we didn't have the internet then, so I couldn't easily find out how straightforward modular arithmetic is! You have the internet now, so you have no excuse. If you did solve the problem, don't just pat yourself on the back. Think about the key steps you made, and what the signs were to try them. Think about the blind alleys you explored en route to the solution, and how you could have avoided them. Those lessons will serve you well later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come back&lt;/strong&gt;. If you gave up and looked at the solutions, then come back and try the problem again a few weeks later. If you don't have any solutions to look at, keep the problem alive. Store it away on paper or in your mind. Richard Feynman once wrote that he would keep four or five problems active in the back of his mind. Whenever he heard a new strategy or technique, he would quickly run through his problems and see if he could use it to solve one of his problems. He credits this practice for some of the anecdotes that gave Feynman such a reputation for being a genius. It's further evidence that being a genius is an awful lot about effort, preparation, and being comfortable with challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Bitcoin is a Cult</title>
<link>https://adamcaudill.com/2018/06/21/bitcoin-is-a-cult/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://adamcaudill.com/2018/06/21/bitcoin-is-a-cult/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Bitcoin community has changed greatly over the years; from technophiles that could explain a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree&quot;&gt;Merkle tree&lt;/a&gt; in their sleep, to speculators driven by the desire for a quick profit &amp;amp; blockchain startups seeking billion dollar valuations led by people who don’t even know what a Merkle tree is. As the years have gone on, a zealotry has been building around Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies driven by people who see them as something far grander than they actually are; people who believe that normal (or fiat) currencies are becoming a thing of the past, and the cryptocurrencies will fundamentally change the world’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, their ranks grow, and their perception of cryptocurrencies becomes more grandiose, even as &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/how-crypto-kitties-disrupted-the-ethereum-network-845c22aa1e6e&quot;&gt;novel uses&lt;/a&gt; of the technology brings it to its knees. While I’m a firm believer that a well designed cryptocurrency could ease the flow of money across borders, and provide a stable option in areas of mass inflation, the reality is that we aren’t there yet. In fact, it’s the substantial instability in value that allows speculators to make money. Those that preach that the US Dollar and Euro are on their deathbed have utterly abandoned an objective view of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A little background…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read the Bitcoin white-paper the day it was released – an interesting use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree&quot;&gt;Merkle trees&lt;/a&gt; to create a public ledger and a fairly reasonable consensus protocol – it got the attention of many in the cryptography sphere for its novel properties. In the years since that paper was released, Bitcoin has become rather valuable, attracted many that see it as an investment, and a loyal (and vocal) following of people who think it’ll change everything. This discussion is about the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, someone on Twitter posted the hash of a recent Bitcoin block, the thousands of Tweets and other conversations that followed have convinced me that Bitcoin has crossed the line into true cult territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started with this Tweet by Mark Wilcox:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;und&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/00000000000000000021e800c1e8df51b22c1588e5a624bea17e9faa34b2dc4a?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#00000000000000000021e800c1e8df51b22c1588e5a624bea17e9faa34b2dc4a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Mark Wilcox (@mwilcox) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mwilcox/status/1009160832398262273?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 19, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value posted is the hash of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blockchain.info/block-height/528249&quot;&gt;Bitcoin block #528249&lt;/a&gt;. The leading zeros are a result of the mining process; to mine a block you combine the contents of the block with a nonce (and other data), hash it, and it has to have at least a certain number of leading zeros to be considered valid. If it doesn’t have the correct number, you change the nonce and try again. Repeat this until the number of leading zeros is the right number, and you now have a valid block. The part that people got excited about is what follows, 21e800.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some are claiming this is an intentional reference, that whoever mined this block actually went well beyond the current difficulty to not just bruteforce the leading zeros, but also the next 24 bits – which would require some serious computing power. If someone had the ability to bruteforce this, it could indicate something rather serious, such as a substantial breakthrough in computing or cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must be asking yourself, what’s so important about 21e800 – a question you would surely regret. Some are claiming it’s a reference to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Exceptionally_Simple_Theory_of_Everything&quot;&gt;E8 Theory&lt;/a&gt; (a widely criticized paper that presents a standard field theory), or to the 21,000,000 total Bitcoins that will eventually exist (despite the fact that &lt;code&gt;21 x 10^8&lt;/code&gt; would be 2,100,000,000). There are others, they are just too crazy to write about. Another important fact is that a block is mined on average on once a year that has 21e8 following the leading zeros – those were never seen as anything important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to where things get fun: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@coop__soup/00000000000000000021e800c1e8df51b22c1588e5a624bea17e9faa34b2dc4a-cd4b67d446be&quot;&gt;theories&lt;/a&gt; that are circulating about how this happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A quantum computer, that is somehow able to hash at unbelievable speed. This is despite the fact that there’s no indication in theories around quantum computers that they’ll be able to do this; hashing is one thing that’s considered safe from quantum computers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time travel. Yes, people are actually saying that someone came back from the future to mine this block. I think this is crazy enough that I don’t need to get into why this is wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Satoshi Nakamoto is back. Despite the fact that there has been no activity with his private keys, some theorize that he has returned, and is somehow able to do things that nobody can. These theories don’t explain how he could do it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;So basically (as i understand) Satoshi, in order to have known and computed the things that he did, according to modern science he was either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A) Using a quantum computer&lt;br/&gt;B) Fom the future&lt;br/&gt;C) Both&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Crypto Randy Marsh [REKT] (@nondualrandy) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nondualrandy/status/1009609117768605696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 21, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all this sounds like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerology&quot;&gt;numerology&lt;/a&gt; to you, you aren’t alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this discussion around special meaning in block hashes also reignited the discussion around something that is, at least somewhat, interesting. The Bitcoin genesis block, the first bitcoin block, does have an unusual property: the early Bitcoin blocks required that the first 32 bits of the hash be zero; however the genesis block had 43 leading zero bits. As the code that produced the genesis block was never released, it’s not known how it was produced, nor is it known what type of hardware was used to produce it. Satoshi had an academic background, so may have had access to more substantial computing power than was common at the time via a university. At this point, the oddities of the genesis block are a historical curiosity, nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A brief digression on hashing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hullabaloo started with the hash of a Bitcoin block; so it’s important to understand just what a hash is, and understand one very important property they have. A hash is a one-way cryptographic function that creates a &lt;em&gt;pseudo-random&lt;/em&gt; output based on the data that it’s given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means, for the purposes of this discussion, is that for each input you get a random output. Random numbers have a way of sometimes looking interesting, simply as a result of being random and the human brain’s affinity to find order in everything. When you start looking for order in random data, you find interesting things – that are yet meaningless, as it’s simply random. When people ascribe significant meaning to random data, it tells you far more about the mindset of those involved rather than the data itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cult of the Coin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let us define a couple of terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cult: a system of religious veneration and devotion directed toward a particular figure or object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Religion: a pursuit or interest to which someone ascribes supreme importance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cult of the Coin has many saints, perhaps none greater than Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym used by the person(s) that created Bitcoin. Vigorously defended, ascribed with ability and understanding far above that of a normal researcher, seen as a visionary beyond compare that is leading the world to a new economic order. When combined with Satoshi’s secretive nature and unknown true identify, adherents to the Cult view Satoshi as a truly venerated figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, of course, with the exception of adherents that follow a different saint, who is unquestionably correct, and any criticism is seen as not only an attack on their saint, but on themselves as well. Those that follow EOS for example, may see Satoshi has a hack that developed a failed project, yet will react fiercely to the slightest criticism of EOS, a reaction so strong that it’s reserved only for an attack on one’s deity. Those that follow IOTA react with equal fierceness; and there are many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These adherents have abandoned objectivity and reasonable discourse, and allowed their zealotry to cloud their vision. Any discussion of these projects and the people behind them that doesn’t include glowing praise inevitably ends with a level of vitriolic speech that is beyond reason for a discussion of technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is dangerous, for many reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Developers &amp;amp; researchers are blinded to flaws. Due to the vast quantities of praise by adherents, those involved develop a grandiose view of their own abilities, and begin to view criticism as unjustified attacks – as they couldn’t possibly have been wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real problems are attacked. Instead of technical issues being seen as problems to be solved and opportunities to improve, they are seen as attacks from people who must be motivated to destroy the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One coin to rule them all. Adherents are often aligned to one, and only one, saint. Acknowledging the qualities of another project means acceptance of flaws or deficiencies in their own, which they will not do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preventing real progress. Evolution is brutal, it requires death, it requires projects to fail and that the reasons for those failures to be acknowledged. If lessons from failure are ignored, if things that should die aren’t allowed to, progress stalls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussions around many of the cryptocurrencies and related blockchain projects are becoming more and more toxic, becoming impossible for well-intentioned people to have real technical discussions without being attacked. With discussions of real flaws, flaws that would doom a design in any other environment, being instantly treated as heretical without any analysis to determine the factual claims becoming routine, the cost for the well-intentioned to get involved has become extremely high. There are at least some that are aware of significant security flaws that have opted to remain silent due to the highly toxic environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was once driven by curiosity, a desire to learn and improve, to determine the viability of ideas, is now driven by blind greed, religious zealotry, self-righteousness, and self-aggrandizement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have precious little hope for the future of projects that inspire this type of zealotry, and its continuous spread will likely harm real research in this area for many years to come. These are technical projects, some projects succeed, some fail – this is how technology evolves. Those designing these systems are human, just as flawed as the rest of us, and so too are the projects flawed. Some are well suited to certain use cases and not others, some aren’t suited to any use case, none yet are suited to all. The discussions about these projects should be focused on the technical aspects, and done so to evolve this field of research; adding a religious to these projects harms all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Note: There are many examples of this behavior that could be cited, however in the interest of protecting those that have been targeted for criticizing projects, I have opted to minimize such examples. I have seen too many people who I respect, too many that I consider friends, being viciously attacked – I have no desire to draw attention to those attacks, and risk restarting them.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Teens Who Hacked Microsoft&amp;#039;s Xbox Empire and Went Too Far</title>
<link>https://www.wired.com/story/xbox-underground-videogame-hackers/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.wired.com/story/xbox-underground-videogame-hackers/</guid>
<description>&lt;section class=&quot;section-break-component&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;I. The Bumper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;section-break-component&quot; readability=&quot;95.318484176577&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;The trip to&lt;/span&gt; Delaware was only supposed to last a day. David Pokora, a bespectacled University of Toronto senior with scraggly blond hair down to his shoulders, needed to travel south to fetch a bumper that he’d bought for his souped-up Volks­wagen Golf R.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American seller had balked at shipping to Canada, so Pokora arranged to have the part sent to a buddy, Justin May, who lived in Wilmington. The young men, both ardent gamers, shared a fascination with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/tag/xbox&quot;&gt;inner workings of the Xbox&lt;/a&gt;; though they’d been chatting and collaborating for years, they’d never met in person. Pokora planned to make the eight-hour drive on a Friday, grab a leisurely dinner with May, then haul the metallic-blue bumper back home to Mississauga, Ontario, that night or early the next morning. His father offered to tag along so they could take turns behind the wheel of the family’s Jetta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An hour into their journey on March 28, 2014, the Pokoras crossed the Lewiston–Queenston Bridge and hit the border checkpoint on the eastern side of the Niagara Gorge. An American customs agent gently quizzed them about their itinerary as he scanned their passports in his booth. He seemed ready to wave the Jetta through when something on his monitor caught his eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s … Xenon?” the agent asked, stumbling over the pronunciation of the word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David, who was in the passenger seat, was startled by the question. Xenon was one of his online aliases, a pseudonym he often used—along with Xenomega and DeToX—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/tag/halo&quot;&gt;when playing &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or discussing his Xbox hacking projects with fellow programmers. Why would that nickname, familiar to only a handful of gaming fanatics, pop up when his passport was checked?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokora’s puzzlement lasted a few moments before he remembered that he’d named his one-man corporation Xenon Development Studios; the business processed payments for the Xbox service he operated that gave monthly subscribers the ability to unlock achievements or skip levels in more than 100 different games. He mentioned the company to the customs agent, making sure to emphasize that it was legally registered. The agent instructed the Pokoras to sit tight for just a minute longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he and his father waited for permission to enter western New York, David detected a flutter of motion behind the idling Jetta. He glanced back and saw two men in dark uniforms approaching the car, one on either side. “Something’s wrong,” his father said, an instant before a figure appeared outside the passenger-­side window. As a voice barked at him to step out of the vehicle, Pokora realized he’d walked into a trap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the detention area of the adjoining US Customs and Border Protection building, an antiseptic room with a lone metal bench, Pokora pondered all the foolish risks he’d taken while in thrall to his Xbox obsession. When he’d started picking apart the console’s software a decade earlier, it had seemed like harmless fun—a way for him and his friends to match wits with the corporate engineers whose ranks they yearned to join. But the Xbox hacking scene had turned sordid over time, its ethical norms corroded by the allure of money, thrills, and status. And Pokora had gradually become enmeshed in a series of schemes that would have alarmed his younger self: infiltrating game developers’ networks, counterfeiting an Xbox prototype, even abetting a burglary on &lt;a href=&quot;https://wired.com/tag/microsoft&quot;&gt;Microsoft’s main campus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokora had long been aware that his misdeeds had angered some powerful interests, and not just within the gaming industry; in the course of seeking out all things Xbox, he and his associates had wormed into American military networks too. But in those early hours after his arrest, Pokora had no clue just how much legal wrath he’d brought upon his head: For eight months he’d been under sealed indictment for conspiring to steal as much as $1 billion worth of intellectual property, and federal prosecutors were intent on making him the first foreign hacker to be convicted for the theft of American trade secrets. Several of his friends and colleagues would end up being pulled into the vortex of trouble he’d helped create; one would become an informant, one would become a fugitive, and one would end up dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokora could see his father sitting in a room outside the holding cell, on the other side of a thick glass partition. He watched as a federal agent leaned down to inform the elder Pokora, a Polish-born construction worker, that his only son wouldn’t be returning to Canada for a very long time; his father responded by burying his head in his calloused hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutted to have caused the usually stoic man such anguish, David wished he could offer some words of comfort. “It’s going to be OK, dad,” he said in a soft voice, gesturing to get his attention. “It’s going to be OK.” But his father couldn’t hear him through the glass.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;II. Kindergarten Security Mistakes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;section-break-component&quot; readability=&quot;68.518966577814&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;Well before he&lt;/span&gt; could read or write, David Pokora mastered the intricacies of first-person shooters. There is a grainy video of him playing &lt;em&gt;Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold&lt;/em&gt; in 1995, his 3-year-old fingers nimbly dancing around the keyboard of his parents’ off-brand PC. What captivated him about the game was not its violence but rather the seeming magic of its controls; he wondered how a boxy beige machine could convert his physical actions into onscreen motion. The kid was a born programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokora dabbled in coding throughout elementary school, building tools like basic web browsers. But he became wholly enamored with the craft as a preteen on a family trip to Poland. He had lugged his bulky laptop to the sleepy town where his parents’ relatives lived. There was little else to do, so as chickens roamed the yards he passed the time by teaching himself the Visual Basic .NET programming language. The house where he stayed had no internet access, so Pokora couldn’t Google for help when his programs spit out errors. But he kept chipping away at his code until it was immaculate, a labor-intensive process that filled him with unexpected joy. By the time he got back home, he was hooked on the psychological rewards of bending machines to his will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Pokora began to immerse himself in programming, his family bought its first Xbox. With its ability to connect to multiplayer sessions on the Xbox Live service and its familiar ­Windows-derived architecture, the machine made Pokora’s Super Nintendo seem like a relic. Whenever he wasn’t splattering aliens in &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, Pokora scoured the internet for technical information about his new favorite plaything. His wanderings brought him into contact with a community of hackers who were redefining what the Xbox could do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To divine its secrets, these hackers had cracked open the console’s case and eavesdropped on the data that zipped between the motherboard’s various components—the CPU, the RAM, the Flash chip. This led to the discovery of what the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/author/bruce-schneier/&quot;&gt;cryptography expert Bruce Schneier&lt;/a&gt; termed “lots of kindergarten security mistakes.” For example, Microsoft had left the decryption key for the machine’s boot code lying around in an accessible area of the machine’s memory. When an MIT graduate student named Bunnie Huang located that key in 2002, he gave his hacker compatriots the power to trick the Xbox into booting up homebrew programs that could stream music, run Linux, or emulate Segas and Nintendos. All they had to do first was tweak their consoles’ firmware, either by soldering a so-called modchip onto the motherboard or loading a hacked game-save file from a USB drive.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once Pokora hacked his family’s Xbox, he got heavy into tinkering with his cherished &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;. He haunted IRC channels and web forums where the best &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; programmers hung out, poring over tutorials on how to alter the physics of the game. He was soon making a name for himself by writing &lt;em&gt;Halo 2&lt;/em&gt; utilities that allowed players to fill any of the game’s landscapes with digitized water or change blue skies into rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hacking free-for-all ended with the release of the second-generation Xbox, the Xbox 360, in November 2005. The 360 had none of the glaring security flaws of its predecessor, to the chagrin of programmers like the 13-year-old Pokora who could no longer run code that hadn’t been approved by Microsoft. There was one potential workaround for frustrated hackers, but it required a rare piece of hardware: an Xbox 360 development kit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dev kits are the machines that Microsoft-approved developers use to write Xbox content. To the untrained eye they look like ordinary consoles, but the units contain most of the software integral to the game development process, including tools for line-by-line debugging. A hacker with a dev kit can manipulate Xbox software just like an authorized programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft sends dev kits only to rigorously screened game-development companies. In the mid-2000s a few kits would occasionally become available when a bankrupt developer dumped its assets in haste, but for the most part the hardware was seldom spotted in the wild. There was one hacker, however, who lucked into a mother lode of 360 dev kits and whose eagerness to profit off his good fortune would help Pokora ascend to the top of the Xbox scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III. The Only Education That Mattered&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;section-break-component&quot; readability=&quot;92&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;In 2006, while&lt;/span&gt; working as a Wells Fargo technology manager in Walnut Creek, California, 38-year-old Rowdy Van Cleave learned that a nearby recycling facility was selling Xbox DVD drives cheap. When he went to inspect the merchandise, the facility’s owners mentioned they received regular deliveries of surplus Microsoft hardware. Van Cleave, who’d been part of a revered Xbox-hacking crew called Team Avalaunch, volunteered to poke around the recyclers’ warehouse and point out any Xbox junk that might have resale value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After sifting through mountains of Xbox flotsam and jetsam, Van Cleave talked the recyclers into letting him take home five motherboards. When he jacked one of them into his Xbox 360 and booted it up, the screen gave him the option to activate debugging mode. “Holy shit,” Van Cleave thought, “this is a frickin’ dev motherboard!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aware that he had stumbled on the Xbox scene’s equivalent of King Tut’s tomb, Van Cleave cut a deal with the recyclers that let him buy whatever discarded Xbox hardware came their way. Some of these treasures he kept for his own sizable collection or handed out to friends; he once gave another Team Avalaunch member a dev kit as a wedding present. But Van Cleave was always on the lookout for paying customers he could trust to be discreet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 16-year-old Pokora became one of those customers in 2008, shortly after meeting Van Cleave through an online friend and impressing him with his technical prowess. In addition to buying kits for himself, Pokora acted as a salesman for Van Cleave, peddling hardware at significant markup to other &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; hackers; he charged around $1,000 per kit, though desperate souls sometimes ponied up as much as $3,000. (Van Cleave denies that Pokora sold kits on his behalf.) He befriended several of his customers, including a guy named Justin May who lived in Wilmington, Delaware.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now flush with dev kits, Pokora was able to start modifying the recently released &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; 3. He kept vampire hours as he hacked, coding in a trancelike state that he termed “hyperfocus” until he dropped from exhaustion at around 3 or 4 am. He was often late for school, but he shrugged off his slumping grades; he considered programming on his dev kit to be the only education that mattered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokora posted snippets of his &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; 3 work on forums like Halomods.com, which is how he came to the attention of a hacker in Whittier, California, named Anthony Clark. The 18-year-old Clark had experience disassembling Xbox games—reverse-engineering their code from machine language into a programming language. He reached out to Pokora and proposed that they join forces on some projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clark and Pokora grew close, talking nearly every day about programming as well as music, cars, and other adolescent fixations. Pokora sold Clark a dev kit so they could hack &lt;em&gt;Halo 3&lt;/em&gt; in tandem; Clark, in turn, gave Pokora tips on the art of the disassembly. They ­cowrote a &lt;em&gt;Halo 3&lt;/em&gt; tool that let them endow the protagonist, Master Chief, with special skills—like the ability to jump into the clouds or fire weird projectiles. And they logged countless hours playing their hacked creations on PartnerNet, a sandbox version of Xbox Live available only to dev kit owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they released bits and pieces of their software online, Pokora and Clark began to hear from engineers at Microsoft and Bungie, the developer behind the &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; series. The professional programmers offered nothing but praise, despite knowing that Pokora and Clark were using ill-gotten dev kits. &lt;em&gt;Cool, you did a good job of reverse-engineering this&lt;/em&gt;, they’d tell Pokora. The encouraging feedback convinced him that he was on an unorthodox path to a career in game development—perhaps the only path available to a construction worker’s son from Mississauga who was no classroom star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Pokora and Clark occasionally flirted with darker hijinks. By 2009 the pair was using PartnerNet not only to play their modded versions of &lt;em&gt;Halo 3&lt;/em&gt; but also to swipe unreleased software that was still being tested. There was one &lt;em&gt;Halo 3&lt;/em&gt; map that Pokora snapped a picture of and then shared too liberally with friends; the screenshot wound up getting passed around among &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; fans. When Pokora and Clark next returned to PartnerNet to play &lt;em&gt;Halo 3&lt;/em&gt;, they encountered a message on the game’s main screen that Bungie engineers had expressly left for them: “Winners Don’t Break Into PartnerNet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two hackers laughed off the warning. They considered their mischief all in good fun—they’d steal a beta here and there, but only because they loved the Xbox so much, not to enrich themselves. They saw no reason to stop playing cat and mouse with the Xbox pros, whom they hoped to call coworkers some day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;IV. I Mean, It's Just Videogames&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;section-break-component&quot; readability=&quot;63.665658509761&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;The Xbox 360&lt;/span&gt; remained largely invulnerable until late 2009, when security researchers finally identified a weakness: By affixing a modchip to an arcane set of motherboard pins used for quality-assurance testing, they managed to nullify the 360’s defenses. The hack came to be known as the JTAG, after the Joint Test Action Group, the industry body that had recommended adding the pins to all printed circuit boards in the mid-1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When news of the vulnerability broke, Xbox 360 owners rushed to get their consoles JTAGed by services that materialized overnight. With 23 million subscribers now on Xbox Live, multi­player gaming had become vastly more competitive, and a throng of gamers whom Pokora dubbed “spoiled kids with their parents’ credit cards” were willing to go to extraordinary lengths to humiliate their rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Pokora and Clark, it was an opportunity to cash in. They hacked the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/tag/call-of-duty/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/a&gt; of military-themed shooters to create so-called modded lobbies—places on Xbox Live where &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; players could join games governed by reality-bending rules. For fees that ranged up to $100 per half-hour, players with JTAGed consoles could participate in death matches while wielding superpowers: They could fly, walk through walls, sprint with Flash-like speed, or shoot bullets that never missed their targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an extra $50 to $150, Pokora and Clark also offered “infections”—powers that players’ characters would retain when they joined nonhacked games. Pokora was initially reluctant to sell infections: He knew his turbocharged clients would slaughter their hapless opponents, a situation that struck him as contrary to the spirit of gaming. But then the money started rolling in—as much as $8,000 on busy days. There were so many customers that he and Clark had to hire employees to deal with the madness. Swept up in the excitement of becoming an entrepreneur, Pokora forgot all about his commitment to fairness. It was one more step down a ladder he barely noticed he was descending.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Microsoft tried to squelch breaches like the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; cheats by launching an automated system that could detect JTAGed consoles and ban them. But Pokora reverse-engineered the system and devised a way to beat it: He wrote a program that hijacked Xbox Live’s security queries to an area of the console where they could be filled with false data, and thus be duped into certifying a hacked console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokora reveled in the perks of his success. He still lived with his parents, but he paid his tuition as he entered the University of Toronto in the fall of 2010. He and his girlfriend dined at upscale restaurants every night and stayed at $400-a-night hotels as they traveled around Canada for metal shows. But he wasn’t really in it for the money or even the adulation of his peers; what he most coveted was the sense of glee and power he derived from making $60 million games behave however he wished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokora knew there was a whiff of the illegal about his &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; business, which violated numerous copyrights. But he interpreted the lack of meaningful pushback from either Microsoft or Activision, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;’s developer, as a sign that the companies would tolerate his enterprise, much as Bungie had put up with his &lt;em&gt;Halo 3&lt;/em&gt; shenanigans. Activision did send a series of cease-and-desist letters, but the company never followed through on its threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I mean, it’s just videogames,” Pokora told himself whenever another Activision letter arrived. “It’s not like we’re hacking into a server or stealing anyone’s information.” That would come soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;V. Tunnels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;section-break-component&quot; readability=&quot;91.843083745523&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;Dylan Wheeler, a&lt;/span&gt; hacker in Perth, Australia, whose alias was SuperDaE, knew that something juicy had fallen into his lap. An American friend of his who went by the name Gamerfreak had slipped him a password list for the public forums operated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/tag/epic-games/&quot;&gt;Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;, a Cary, North Carolina, game developer known for its &lt;em&gt;Unreal&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Gears of War&lt;/em&gt; series. In 2010 Wheeler started poking around the forums’ accounts to see if any of them belonged to Epic employees. He eventually identified a member of the company’s IT department whose employee email address and password appeared on Gamerfreak’s list; rummaging through the man’s personal emails, Wheeler found a password for an internal EpicGames.com account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once he had a toehold at Epic, Wheeler wanted a talented partner to help him sally deeper into the network. “Who is big enough to be interested in something like this?” he wondered. Xenomega—David Pokora—whom he’d long admired from afar and was eager to befriend, was the first name that popped to mind. Wheeler cold-messaged the Canadian and offered him the chance to get inside one of the world’s preeminent game developers; he didn’t mention that he was only 14, fearing that his age would be a deal breaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Wheeler was proposing was substantially shadier than anything Pokora had attempted before: It was one thing to download &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; maps from the semipublic PartnerNet and quite another to break into a fortified private network where a company stores its most sensitive data. But Pokora was overwhelmed by curiosity about what software he might unearth on Epic’s servers and titillated by the prospect of reverse-engineering a trove of top-secret games. And so he rationalized what he was about to do by setting ground rules—he wouldn’t take any credit card numbers, for example, nor peek at personal information about Epic’s customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokora and Wheeler combed through Epic’s network by masquerading as the IT worker whose login credentials Wheeler had compromised. They located a plugged-in USB drive that held all of the company’s passwords, including one that gave them root access to the entire network. Then they pried into the computers of Epic bigwigs such as design director Cliff “CliffyB” Bleszinski; the pair chortled when they opened a music folder that Bleszinski had made for his Lamborghini and saw that it contained lots of Katy Perry and Miley Cyrus tunes. (Bleszinski, who left Epic in 2012, confirms the hackers’ account, adding that he’s “always been public and forthright about my taste for bubblegum pop.”)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To exfiltrate Epic’s data, Wheeler enlisted the help of Sanadodeh “Sonic” Nesheiwat, a New Jersey gamer who possessed a hacked cable modem that could obfuscate its location. In June 2011 Nesheiwat downloaded a prerelease copy of &lt;em&gt;Gears of War 3&lt;/em&gt; from Epic, along with hundreds of gigabytes of other software. He burned Epic’s source code onto eight Blu-ray discs that he shipped to Pokora in a package marked wedding videos. Pokora shared the game with several friends, including his dev kit customer Justin May; within days a copy showed up on the Pirate Bay, a notorious BitTorrent site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Gears of War 3&lt;/em&gt; leak triggered a federal investigation, and Epic began working with the FBI to determine how its security had been breached. Pokora and Wheeler found out about the nascent probe while reading Epic’s emails; they freaked out when one of those emails described a meeting between the company’s brain trust and FBI agents. “I need your help—I’m going to get arrested,” a panicked Pokora wrote to May that July. “I need to encrypt some hard drives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the email chatter between Epic and the FBI quickly died down, and the company made no apparent effort to block the hackers’ root access to the network—a sign that it couldn’t pinpoint their means of entry. Having survived their first brush with the law, the hackers felt emboldened—the brazen Wheeler most of all. He kept trespassing on sensitive areas of Epic’s network, making few efforts to conceal his IP address as he spied on high-level corporate meetings through webcams he’d commandeered. “He knowingly logs into Epic knowing that the feds chill there,” Nesheiwat told Pokora about their Australian partner. “They were emailing FBI people, but he still manages to not care.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Owning Epic’s network gave the hackers entrée to a slew of other organizations. Pokora and Wheeler came across login credentials for Scaleform, a so-called middleware company that provided technology for the engine at the heart of Epic’s games. Once they’d broken into Scaleform, they discovered that the company’s network was full of credentials for Silicon Valley titans, Hollywood entertainment conglomerates, and Zombie Studios, the developer of the &lt;em&gt;Spec Ops&lt;/em&gt; series of games. On Zombie’s network they uncovered remote-access “tunnels” to its clients, including branches of the American military. Wriggling through those poorly secured tunnels was no great challenge, though Pokora was wary of leaving behind too many digital tracks. “If they notice any of this,” he told the group, “they’re going to come looking for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the scale of their enterprise increased, the hackers discussed what they should do if the FBI came knocking. High off the feeling of omni­potence that came from burrowing into supposedly impregnable networks, Pokora proposed releasing all of Epic’s proprietary data as an act of revenge: “If we ever go disappearing, just, you know, upload it to the internet and say fuck you Epic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group also cracked jokes about what they should call their prison gang. Everyone dug Wheeler’s tongue-in-cheek suggestion that they could strike fear into other inmates’ hearts by dubbing themselves the Xbox Underground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;VI. How Do We End It?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;section-break-component&quot; readability=&quot;99.291756836514&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;Pokora was becoming&lt;/span&gt; ever more infatuated with his forays into corporate networks, and his old friends from the Xbox scene feared for his future. Kevin Skitzo, a Team Avalaunch hacker, urged him to pull back from the abyss. “Dude, just stop this shit,” he implored Pokora. “Focus on school, because this shit? I mean, I get it—it’s a high. But as technology progresses and law enforcement gets more aware, you can only dodge that bullet for so long.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Pokora was too caught up in the thrill of stockpiling forbidden software to heed this advice. In September 2011 he stole a prerelease copy of &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;: Modern Warfare 3. “Let’s get arrested,” he quipped to his friends as he started the download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though he was turning cocky as he swung from network to network without consequence, Pokora still took pride in how little he cared about money. After seizing a database that contained “a fuckton of PayPals,” Pokora sang his own praises to his associates for resisting the temptation to profit off the accounts. “We could already have sold them for Bitcoins which would have been untraceable if we did it right. It could have already been easily an easy fifty grand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with each passing week, Pokora became a little bit more mercenary. In November 2011, for example, he asked his friend May to broker a deal with a gamer who went by Xboxdevguy, who’d expressed an interest in buying prerelease games. Pokora was willing to deliver any titles Xboxdevguy desired for a few hundred dollars each.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Pokora’s close relationship with May made his hacker cohorts uneasy. They knew that May had been arrested at a Boston gaming convention in March 2010 for trying to download the source code for the first-person shooter Breach. A spokesperson for the game’s developer told the tech blog Engadget that, upon being caught after a brief foot chase, May had said he “could give us bigger and more important people and he could ‘name names.’” But Pokora trusted May because he’d watched him participate in many crooked endeavors; he couldn’t imagine that anyone in cahoots with law enforcement would be allowed to do so much dirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the spring of 2012, Pokora and Wheeler were focused on pillaging the network of Zombie Studios. Their crew now included two new faces from the scene: Austin “AAmonkey” Alcala, an Indiana high school kid, and Nathan “animefre4k” Leroux, the home­schooled son of a diesel mechanic from Bowie, Maryland. Leroux, in particular, was an exceptional talent: He’d cowritten a program that could trick &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/tag/electronic-arts/&quot;&gt;Electronic Arts&lt;/a&gt;’ soccer game FIFA 2012 into minting the virtual coins that players get for completing matches, and which are used to buy character upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While navigating through Zombie’s network, the group stumbled on a tunnel to a US Army server; it contained a simulator for the AH-64D Apache helicopter that Zombie was developing on a Pentagon contract. Ever the wild man, Wheeler downloaded the software and told his colleagues they should “sell the simulators to the Arabs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hackers were also busy tormenting Microsoft, stealing documents that contained specs for an early version of the Durango, the codename for the next-generation Xbox—a machine that would come to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2013/05/xbox-one/&quot;&gt;known as the Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than sell the documents to a Microsoft competitor, the hackers opted for a more byzantine scheme: They would counterfeit and sell a Durango themselves, using off-the-shelf components. Leroux volunteered to do the assembly in exchange for a cut of the proceeds; he needed money to pay for online computer science classes at the University of Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hackers put out feelers around the scene and found a buyer in the Seychelles who was willing to pay $5,000 for the counterfeit console. May picked up the completed machine from Leroux’s house and promised to ship it to the archipelago in the Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Durango never arrived at its destination. When the buyer complained, paranoia set in: Had the FBI intercepted the shipment? Were they now all under surveillance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wheeler was especially unsettled: He’d thought the crew was untouchable after the Epic investigation appeared to stall, but now he felt certain that everyone was about to get hammered by a racketeering case. “How do we end this game?” he asked himself. The answer he came up with was to go down in a blaze of glory, to do things that would ensure his place in Xbox lore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheeler launched his campaign for notoriety by posting a Durango for sale on eBay, using photographs of the one that Leroux had built. The bidding for the nonexistent machine reached $20,100 before eBay canceled the auction, declaring it fraudulent. Infuriated by the media attention the saga generated, Pokora cut off contact with Wheeler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, Leroux vanished from the scene; rumors swirled that he’d been raided by the FBI. Americans close to Pokora began to tell him they were being tailed by black cars with tinted windows. The hackers suspected there might be an informant in their midst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;VII. Person A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;section-break-component&quot; readability=&quot;131.4155597723&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;The relationship between&lt;/span&gt; Pokora and Clark soured as Pokora got deeper into hacking developers. The two finally fell out over staffing issues at their &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; business—for example, they hired some workers whom Pokora considered greedy, but Clark refused to call them out. Sick of dealing with such friction, both men drifted into other ventures. Pokora focused on Horizon, an Xbox cheating service that he built on the side with some friends; he liked that Horizon’s cheats couldn’t be used on Xbox Live, which meant fewer potential technical and legal headaches. Clark, meanwhile, refined Leroux’s &lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt; coin-minting technology and started selling the virtual currency on the black market. Austin Alcala, who’d participated in the hack of Zombie Studios and the Xbox One counterfeiting caper, worked for Clark’s new venture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the now 20-year-old Pokora split his energies between helping to run Horizon and attending university, Wheeler continued his kamikaze quest for attention. In the wake of his eBay stunt, Microsoft sent a private investigator named Miles Hawkes to Perth to confront him. Wheeler posted on Twitter about meeting “Mr. Microsoft Man,” who pressed him for information about his collaborators over lunch at the Hyatt. According to Wheeler, Hawkes told him not to worry about any legal repercussions, as Microsoft was only interested in going after “real assholes.” (Micro­soft denies that Hawkes said this.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2012 the FBI raided Sanadodeh Nesheiwat’s home in New Jersey. Nesheiwat posted an unredacted version of the search warrant online. Wheeler reacted by doxing the agents in a public forum and encouraging people to harass them; he also spoke openly about hiring a hitman to murder the federal judge who’d signed the warrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheeler’s bizarre compulsion to escalate every situation alarmed federal prosecutors, who’d been carefully building a case against the hackers since the &lt;em&gt;Gears of War&lt;/em&gt; leak in June 2011. Edward McAndrew, the assistant US attorney who was leading the investigation, felt he needed to accelerate the pace of his team’s work before Wheeler sparked real violence.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On the morning of February 19, 2013, Wheeler was working in his family’s home in Perth when he noticed a commotion in the yard below his window. A phalanx of men in light tactical gear was approaching the house, Glocks holstered by their sides. Wheeler scrambled to shut down all of his computers, so that whoever would be dissecting his hardware would at least have to crack his passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few hours, Australian police carted away what Wheeler estimated to be more than $20,000 worth of computer equipment; Wheeler was miffed that no one bothered to place his precious hard drives in antistatic bags. He wasn’t jailed that day, but his hard drives yielded a bounty of incriminating evidence: Wheeler had taken frequent screenshots of his hacking exploits, such as a chat in which he proposed running “some crazy program to fuck the fans up” on Zombie Studios’ servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That July, Pokora told Justin May he was about to attend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/tag/defcon/&quot;&gt;Defcon, the annual hacker gathering&lt;/a&gt; in Las Vegas—his first trip across the border in years. On July 23, ­McAndrew and his colleagues filed a sealed 16-count indictment against Pokora, Nesheiwat, and ­Leroux, charging them with crimes including wire fraud, identify theft, and conspiracy to steal trade secrets; Wheeler and Gamerfreak, the original source of the Epic password list, were named as unindicted coconspirators. (Alcala would be added as a defendant four months later.) The document revealed that much of the government’s case was built on evidence supplied by an informant referred to as Person A. He was described as a Delaware resident who had picked up the counterfeit Durango from Leroux’s house, then handed it over to the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors also characterized the defendants as members of the “Xbox Underground.” Wheeler’s prison-gang joke was a joke no longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;inset-left-component inset-left-component--pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;inset-left&quot; class=&quot;inset-left-component__el&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hackers cracked jokes about what they should call their prison gang. Everyone dug Wheeler's tongue-in-cheek suggestion that they could strike fear into the hearts of other inmates by dubbing themselves the Xbox Underground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though he knew nothing about the secret indictment, Pokora was too busy to go to Defcon and pulled out at the last minute. The FBI worried that arresting his American coconspirators would spur him to go on the lam, so the agency decided to wait for him to journey south before rolling up the crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two months later, Pokora went to the Toronto Opera House for a show by the Swedish metal band Katatonia. His phone buzzed as a warm-up act was tearing through a song—it was Alcala, now a high school senior in Fishers, Indiana. He was tittering with excitement: He said he knew a guy who could get them both the latest Durango prototypes—real ones, not counterfeits like the machine they’d made the summer before. His connection was willing to break into a building on Microsoft’s Redmond campus to steal them. In exchange, the burglar was demanding login credentials for Microsoft’s game developer network plus a few thousand dollars. Pokora was baffled by the aspiring burglar’s audacity. “This guy’s stupid,” he thought. But after years of pushing his luck, Pokora was no longer in the habit of listening to his own common sense. He told Alcala to put them in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The burglar was a recent high school graduate named Arman, known on the scene as ArmanTheCyber. (He agreed to share his story on the condition that his last name not be used.) A year earlier he’d cloned a Microsoft employee badge that belonged to his mother’s boyfriend; he’d been using the RFID card to explore the Redmond campus ever since, passing as an employee by dressing head to toe in Microsoft swag. (Microsoft claims he didn’t copy the badge but rather stole it.) The 18-year-old had already stolen one Durango for personal use; he was nervous about going back for more but also brimming with the recklessness of youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 9 pm on a late September night, Arman swiped himself into the building that housed the Durangos. A few engineers were still roaming the hallways; Arman dove into a cubicle and hid whenever he heard footsteps. He eventually climbed the stairs to the fifth floor, where he’d heard there was a cache of Durangos. As he started to make his way into the darkened floor, motion detectors sensed his presence and light flooded the room. Spooked, Arman bolted back downstairs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;He finally found what he was looking for in two third-floor cubicles. One of the Durangos had a pair of stiletto heels atop the case; Arman put the two consoles in his oversize backpack and left the fancy shoes on the carpet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week after he sent the stolen Durangos to Pokora and Alcala, Arman received some surprising news: A Microsoft vendor had finally reviewed an employment application he’d submitted that summer and hired him as a quality-­assurance tester. He lasted only a couple weeks on the job before investigators identified him as the Durango thief; a stairwell camera had caught him leaving the building. To minimize the legal fallout, he begged Pokora and Alcala to send back the stolen consoles. He also returned the Durango he’d taken for himself, and not a moment too soon: Jealous hackers had been scoping out his house online, as a prelude to executing a robbery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokora spent all winter hacking the Xbox 360’s games for Horizon. But as Toronto was beginning to thaw out in March 2014, he figured he could spare a weekend to drive down to Delaware and pick up the bumper he’d ordered for his Volkswagen Golf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Y’know, there’s a chance I could get arrested,” he told his dad as they prepared to leave. His father had no idea what he was talking about and cracked a thin smile at what was surely a bad joke.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;VIII. &quot;This Life Ain't For You&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;section-break-component&quot; readability=&quot;156&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;After an initial&lt;/span&gt; appearance at the federal courthouse in Buffalo and a few days in a nearby county jail, Pokora was loaded into a van alongside another federal inmate, a gang member with a powerlifter’s arms and no discernible neck. They were being transported to a private prison in Ohio, where Pokora would be held until the court in Delaware was ready to start its proceedings against him. For kicks, he says, the guards tossed the prisoners’ sandwiches onto the floor of the van, knowing that the tightly shackled men couldn’t reach them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the three-hour journey, the gang member, who was serving time for beating a man with a hammer, counseled Pokora to do whatever was necessary to minimize his time behind bars. “This life ain’t for you,” he said. “This life ain’t for nobody, really.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokora took those words to heart when he was finally brought to Delaware in early April 2014. He quickly accepted the plea deal that was offered, and he helped the victimized companies identify the vulnerabilities he’d exploited—for example, the lightly protected tunnels that let him hopscotch among networks. As he sat in rooms and listened to Pokora explain his hacks with professorial flair, McAndrew, the lead prosecutor, took a shine to the now 22-year-old Canadian. “He’s a very talented kid who started down a bad path,” he says. “A lot of times when you’re investigating these things, you have to have a certain level of admiration for the brilliance and creativity of the work. But then you kind of step back and say, ‘Here’s where it went wrong.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, on the way from jail to court, Pokora was placed in a marshal’s vehicle with someone who looked familiar—a pale 20-year-old guy with a wispy build and teeth marred by a Skittles habit. It was Nathan Leroux, whom Pokora had never met in person but recognized from a photo. He had been arrested on March 31 in Madison, Wisconsin, where he’d moved after the FBI raid that had scared him into dropping out of the Xbox scene. He’d been flourishing in his new life as a programmer at Human Head Studios, a small game developer, when the feds showed up to take him into custody.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As he and Leroux rode to court in shackles, Pokora tried to pass along the gang member’s advice. “Look, a lot of this was escalated because of DaE—DaE’s an asshole,” he said, using the shorthand of Wheeler’s nickname, SuperDaE. “You can rat on me or do whatever, because you don’t deserve this shit. Let’s just do what we got to do and get out of here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Pokora, Leroux was granted bail and was allowed to live with his parents as his case progressed. But as he lingered at his Maryland home, he grew convinced that, given his diminutive stature and shy nature, he was doomed to be raped or murdered if he went to prison. His fear became so overpowering that, on June 16, he clipped off his ankle monitor and fled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He paid a friend to try to smuggle him into Canada, nearly 400 miles to the north. But their long drive ended in futility: The Canadians flagged the car at the border. Rather than accept that his escape had failed, Leroux pulled out a knife and tried to sprint across the bridge onto Canadian soil. When officers surrounded him, he decided he had just one option left: He stabbed himself multiple times. Doctors at an Ontario hospital managed to save his life. Once he was released from intensive care and transported back to Buffalo, his bail was revoked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came time for Pokora’s sentencing, his attorney argued for leniency by contending that his client had lost the ability to differentiate play from crime. “David in the real world was something else entirely from David online,” he wrote in his sentencing memorandum. “But it was in this tenebrous world of anonymity, frontier rules, and private communication set at a remove from everyday life that David was incrementally desensitized to an online culture in which the line between playing a videogame and hacking into a computer network narrowed to the vanishing point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After pleading guilty, Pokora, Leroux, and Nesheiwat ultimately received similar punishments: 18 months in prison for Pokora and Nesheiwat, 24 months for Leroux. Pokora did the majority of his time at the Federal Detention Center in Philadelphia, where he made use of the computer room to send emails or listen to MP3s. Once, while waiting for a terminal to open up, a mentally unstable inmate got in his face, and Pokora defended himself so he wouldn’t appear weak; the brawl ended when a guard blasted him with pepper spray. After finishing his prison sentence, Pokora spent several more months awaiting deportation to Canada in an immigration detention facility in Newark, New Jersey. That jail had PCs in the law library, and Pokora got to use his hacker skills to find and play a hidden version of &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Solitaire&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he finally returned to Mississauga in October 2015, Pokora texted his old friend Anthony Clark, who was now facing a legal predicament of his own. Alcala had told the government all about Clark’s &lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt; coin-minting operation. The enterprise had already been on the IRS’s radar: One of Clark’s workers had come under suspicion for withdrawing as much as $30,000 a day from a Dallas bank account. Alcala connected the dots for the feds, explaining to them that the business could fool Electronic Arts’ servers into spitting out thousands of coins per second: The group’s code automated and accelerated &lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt;’s gameplay, so that more than 11,500 matches could be completed in the time it took a human to finish just one. The information he provided led to the indictment of Clark and three others for wire fraud; they had allegedly grossed $16 million by selling the &lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt; coins, primarily to a Chinese businessman they knew only as Tao.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Clark’s three codefendants had all pleaded guilty, he was intent on going to trial. He felt that he had done nothing wrong, especially since Electronic Arts’ terms of service state that its &lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt; coins have no real value. Besides, if Electronic Arts executives were really upset about his operation, why didn’t they reach out to discuss the matter like adults? Perhaps Electronic Arts was just jealous that he—not they—had figured out how to generate revenue from in-game currencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, I’m facing 8+ years,” Clark wrote in a text to Pokora. “And if I take the plea 3½. Either way fuck them. They keep trying to get me to plea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They roof you if you fail at trial,” Pokora warned. “My only concern is to educate you a bit about what it will be like. Because it’s a shitty thing to go through.” But Clark wouldn’t be swayed—he was a man of principle.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That Fourth of July, Pokora wrote to Clark again. He jokingly asked why Clark hadn’t yet sent him a custom video that he’d requested: Clark and his Mexican-American relatives dancing to salsa music beneath a Donald Trump piñata. “Where’s the salsa?” Pokora asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reply came back: “On my chips,” followed by the smiling-face-with-sunglasses emoji. It was the last time Pokora ever heard from his &lt;em&gt;Halo 3&lt;/em&gt; comrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clark’s trial in federal district court in Fort Worth that November did not go as he had hoped: He was convicted on one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. His attorneys thought he had excellent grounds for appeal, since they believed that the prosecution had failed to prove the &lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt; coin business had caused Electronic Arts any actual harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Clark’s legal team never got the chance to make that case. On February 26, 2017, about a month before he was scheduled to be sentenced, Clark died in his Whittier home. People close to his family insist that the death was accidental, the result of a lethal interaction between alcohol and medication. Clark had just turned 27 and left behind an estate valued at more than $4 million.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;IX. &quot;I Wanted to See How Far It Could Go&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;section-break-component&quot; readability=&quot;88.047722342733&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;The members of&lt;/span&gt; the Xbox Underground have readjusted to civilian life with varying degrees of success. In exchange for his coopera­tion, Alcala received no prison time; he enrolled at Ball State University and made the dean’s list. The 20-year-old brought his girlfriend to his April 2016 sentencing hearing—“my first real girlfriend”—and spoke about a talk he’d given at an FBI conference on infrastructure protection. “The world is your oyster,” the judge told him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leroux’s coworkers at Human Head Studios sent letters to the court on his behalf, commending his intelligence and kindness. “He has a very promising game development career ahead of him, and I wouldn’t think he’d ever again risk throwing that away,” one supporter wrote. On his release from prison, Leroux returned to Madison to rejoin the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nesheiwat, who was 28 at the time of his arrest, did not fare as well as his younger colleagues. He struggled with addiction and was ­rearrested last December for violating his probation by using cocaine and opiates; his probation officer said he’d “admitted to doing up to 50 bags of heroin per day” before his most recent stint in rehab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Wheeler had been a juvenile when most of the hacking occurred, the US decided to leave his prosecution to the Australian authorities. After being given 48 hours to turn in his passport, Wheeler drove straight to the airport and absconded to the Czech Republic, his mother’s native land. The Australians imprisoned his mother for aiding his escape, presumably to pressure him into returning home to face justice. (She has since been released.) But Wheeler elected to remain a fugitive, drifting through Europe on an EU passport before eventually settling in the UK. During his travels he tried to crowdfund the purchase of a $500,000 Ferrari, explaining that his doctor said he needed the car to cope with the anxiety caused by his legal travails. (The campaign did not succeed.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;inset-left-component inset-left-component--pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;inset-left&quot; class=&quot;inset-left-component__el&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I never meant for it to get as bad as it did,&quot; Pokora says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokora, who is now 26, was disoriented during his first months back in Canada. He feared that his brain had permanently rotted in prison, a place where intellectual stimulation is in short supply. But he reunited with his girlfriend, whom he’d begged to leave him while he was behind bars, and he reenrolled at the University of Toronto. He scraped together the tuition by taking on freelance projects programming user-interface automation tools; his financial struggles made him nostalgic for the days when he was rolling in &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he learned of Clark’s death, Pokora briefly felt renewed bitterness toward Alcala, who’d been instrumental to the government’s case against his friend. But he let the anger pass. There was nothing to be gained by holding a grudge against his onetime fellow travelers. He couldn’t even work up much resentment against Justin May, whom he and many others are certain was the Delaware-based FBI informant identified as Person A in the Xbox Underground indictment. (“Can’t comment on that, sorry,” May responded when asked whether he was Person A. He is currently being prosecuted in the federal district of eastern Pennsylvania for defrauding Cisco and Microsoft out of millions of dollars’ worth of hardware.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokora still struggles to understand how his love for programming warped into an obsession that knocked his moral compass so far askew. “As much as I consciously made the decisions I did, I never meant for it to get as bad as it did,” he says. “I mean, I wanted access to companies to read some source code, I wanted to learn, I wanted to see how far it could go—that was it. It was really just intellectual curiosity. I didn’t want money—if I wanted money, I would’ve taken all the money that was there. But, I mean, I get it—what it turned into, it’s regrettable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokora knows he’ll forever be persona non grata in the gaming industry, so he’s been looking elsewhere for full-time employment since finishing the classwork for his computer science degree last June. But he’s had a tough time putting together a portfolio of his best work: At the behest of the FBI, Canadian authorities seized all of the computers he’d owned prior to his arrest, and most of the software he’d created during his Xbox heyday was lost forever. They did let him keep his 2013 Volkswagen Golf, however, the car he adores so much that he was willing to drive to Delaware for a bumper. He keeps it parked at his parents’ house in Mississauga, the place where he played his first game at the age of 2, and where he’s lived ever since leaving prison.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://auphonic.com/blog/2012/09/26/opus-revolutionary-open-audio-codec-podcasts-and-internet-audio/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;previous blogpost&lt;/a&gt; we talked about the Opus codec, which offers very low bitrates. Another codec seeking to achieve even lower bitrates is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rowetel.com/?page_id=452&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Codec 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Codec 2 is designed for use with speech only, and although the bitrates are impressive the results aren’t as clear as Opus, as you can hear in the following &lt;a href=&quot;https://auphonic.com/blog/2018/06/01/codec2-podcast-on-floppy-disk/#codec2-examples&quot;&gt;audio examples&lt;/a&gt;. However, there is some interesting work being done with Codec 2 in combination with neural network (&lt;a href=&quot;https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WaveNets&lt;/a&gt;) that is yielding &lt;a href=&quot;https://auphonic.com/blog/2018/06/01/codec2-podcast-on-floppy-disk/#wavenet-examples&quot;&gt;great results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rowetel.com/?page_id=452&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Codec 2&lt;/a&gt; is an open source codec designed for speech, and aims for compression rates between 700bps and 3200bps (bits per seconds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man behind it, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rowetel.com/?page_id=434&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;David Rowe&lt;/a&gt;, is an electronic engineer currently living in South Australia. He started the project in September 2009, with the main aim of improving low-cost radio communication for people living in remote areas of the world. With this in mind, he set out to develop a codec that would significantly reduce file sizes and the bandwidth required when streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another motivation according to David, was to be &lt;strong&gt;free from patented technologies&lt;/strong&gt; used by closed source codes which he believes “require expensive and awkward licenses and are stifling innovation”. His belief is that this work can be done without requiring the use of patent protected codecs, so all his work is open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Potential Applications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rowe’s perceived applications include VOIP trunking, voice over low bandwidth HF/VHF digital radio, (especially for amateur radio, so as to avoid issues with the use of proprietary codecs), and developing world and remote area communications, including military, police and emergency services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why we’re interested here at Auphonic is for its potential for longer podcasts, presentations and audiobooks, allowing for &lt;strong&gt;low storage&lt;/strong&gt; and minimizing the effect of &lt;strong&gt;bad network connections&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How it Works&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve the lower rates sought, speech has to be reduced into the smallest possible information/data, and this means that the amount of redundant information that is transmitted has to be minimized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, Codec 2 uses &lt;strong&gt;harmonic sinusoidal speech coding&lt;/strong&gt;. This splits the speech into 10 - 30ms segments, called frames. Each frame is then analysed for the fundamental frequency (or pitch), and the number of harmonics that fit into a 4Khz bandwidth. Further, for each of the harmonics within the 4khz range, the amplitude and phase are recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This information is then coded, and the decoder reconstructs the audio based on this data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://auphonic.com/media/blog/Codec2_Enc_Dec_Diagram.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://auphonic.com/media/blog/Codec2_Enc_Dec_Diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;Codec 2 encoding and decoding process&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Codec 2 Block diagrams - Encoder (left) And decoder (right)&lt;br/&gt;Figure from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rowetel.com/?page_id=452#refs&quot;&gt;Rowtel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;codec2-examples&quot;&gt;Audio Examples and Comparison with other Codecs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst it all sounds great in theory, how does the reality match up? Let’s have a listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a short wav audio file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying Codec 2 (without the WaveNet decoder) at the different rates available, 3200bps, 2400bps,1600bps,1200bps and 700bps, we get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These examples show significantly reduced file sizes.&lt;br/&gt;Putting that information more meaningfully in terms of &lt;strong&gt;how much storage you would need for an hour of audio:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;At 3200bps, &lt;strong&gt;1 hour&lt;/strong&gt; of audio requires only &lt;strong&gt;1.37MB&lt;/strong&gt; (this would fit on one old 3½-inch floppy disk!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A rate of 2400bps equates to 1.03MB/h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A rate of 1600bps equates to 0.68MB/h (Or approximately &lt;strong&gt;2 hours of audio on one floppy disk&lt;/strong&gt;!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A rate of 1200bps equates to 0.51MB/h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A rate of 700bps equates to 0.3MB/h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So great compression, but the result is clearly not natural sounding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a comparison here is the same audio as a 8kb/s MP3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;MP3 at 8 kb/s - 23kb file size (&lt;a href=&quot;https://auphonic.com/media/audio-examples/codec2/intro-orig_8k.mp3&quot;&gt;download&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;The file size is significantly larger than Codec 2 and the quality is arguably still not useable. You can clearly hear what is sometimes called sizzle - the weird metallic sounds you hear on low quality MP3s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a final codec which is worth comparing, one that that seems to capture the two ideals of usable quality at low bitrates that we want: &lt;a href=&quot;https://auphonic.com/blog/2012/09/26/opus-revolutionary-open-audio-codec-podcasts-and-internet-audio/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Opus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;Because of it's convincing low-bitrate performance, Auphonic already offers Opus encoding all the way down to 6 kbps, the lowest bitrate that Opus supports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing Opus at this 6 kbps rate to the 8kbps MP3 shows a significant improvement - although slightly muffled, it still sounds natural:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to Codec 2, and purely as s a bit of fun, here are some &lt;strong&gt;samples of Codec 2 on music&lt;/strong&gt;! (Note that Codec 2 is not designed for music, it was only ever conceived for use on speech).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally couldn’t listen to the MP3 at this rate, so let’s listen to what Codec 2 does!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Codec 2 at different bitrates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can hear, it is not suitable for this application at all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;wavenet-examples&quot;&gt;Codec 2 and WaveNet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have heard, despite the impressive bitrates achieved, the end result is not very natural sounding.&lt;br/&gt;However, where it starts to get more interesting is the work done by W. Bastiaan Kleijn from Cornell University Library. He has been using with Codec 2 running at 2400bps on the coding side, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rowetel.com/?p=5966&quot;&gt;replaced the Codec 2 decoder with a WaveNet deep learning generative model&lt;/a&gt; (for more informationsee the paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01120.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wavenet based low rate speech coding&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some samples from &lt;a href=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/downloads.webmproject.org/icassp2018/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the authors&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Codec&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Male Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Original File&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Codec 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;With WaveNet Decoder&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Codec&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Female Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Original File&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Codec 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;With WaveNet Decoder&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing to Codec 2 you can hear a &lt;strong&gt;significant increase in quality&lt;/strong&gt;, and if you compare to the original, there is not a significant decrease in quality.&lt;/p&gt;
David Rowe himself has stated that he considers the result to be &lt;strong&gt;&quot;a game changer for low bit rate speech coding&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; and “as good an an 8000bps wideband speech codec”.
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst the (original) Codec 2 project represents very interesting work, it is limited, and the end result is not suited for podcasting. Also as we heard in the audio examples, it can only be used for voice recordings, and not music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Codec 2 in combination with a &lt;strong&gt;WaveNet decoder&lt;/strong&gt; improves the quality a lot and the low bitrate (2400bps) would be extremely interesting for &lt;strong&gt;podcasts and audiobooks distribution&lt;/strong&gt; as well: &lt;strong&gt;one hour of audio&lt;/strong&gt; would require only &lt;strong&gt;1.03MB&lt;/strong&gt; of storage!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auphonic will add support for Codec 2 &lt;a href=&quot;https://auphonic.com/help/web/production.html#output-files&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;output files&lt;/a&gt; when the WaveNet decoder is in a usable form. For now we have just added &lt;strong&gt;support for Codec 2 input files&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook JavaScript SDK is often illegal under GDPR</title>
<link>https://markssoftware.com/2018/06/23/facebook-javascript-sdk-is-often-illegal/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://markssoftware.com/2018/06/23/facebook-javascript-sdk-is-often-illegal/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.facebook.com/docs/javascript/&quot;&gt;Facebook JavaScript SDK&lt;/a&gt; is often included in websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It provides feature to help integrate with Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It provides Facebook with tracking capabilities that assist with audience data and their advertising targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a privacy perspective, under GDPR, this is a consent nightmare and although it may be possible to get legitimate explicit consent to send data to Facebook, is it still legal to be given when there is a second problem… security and access control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a website loads third party JavaScript into a page using a &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; tag then by default it loads with a security context of same-origin – this means that it often it can do whatever JavaScript hosted from the websites’ server can do, so likely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Read any content on the page it is loaded
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Read your user details and often session cookies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modify (add/change/remove) any content on the page
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add a username and password field, capture the values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make network requests to the websites’ servers
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;POST form data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send ajax requests to backend servers as you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make network requests elsewhere
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Append data read to image or script links and add them to the page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make an AJAX call to its own servers or elsewhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access any webpage on your site and do all of the above&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If Facebook is loaded on /about, it can iframe /user/account&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Default security context of iframes in the same domain is that it can access the child iframe and execute scripts in that iframe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are various security mechanisms that may reduce this risk, but the problem with these, is that they are very complex to implement: adding in security contexts to ban eval(), SRI, CORS headers  and more, requires a lot of security review: but also it negates much if not all of the Facebook functionality if you ban Facebook from receiving data, so why load it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put this all together and you can demonstrate to organisations that they need to remove Facebook.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So I got Facebook removed from RBS’s online banking landing page because it could access the account pages (which it was not loaded on).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I got it removed off of a noticeable amount of nhs.uk because when loaded on pages offering advice (like about Flu) it could access data about your GP and your account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ls08tSt-Dko?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/IhrpWhOnVQE?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why is it illegal?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially in regulated contexts (finance, healthcare, etc) there are typically requirements that companies must maintain control of their systems (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/SYSC/3/1.html&quot;&gt;https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/SYSC/3/1.html&lt;/a&gt;) and this cannot mean providing an advertising company with unaudited, uncontrolled access to do whatever it likes. This isn’t like self-hosted JS that would have gone through QA processes to validate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But GDPR and similar privacy laws internationally, also demand that companies have access controls. Not just for what they want to give companies (that’s a consent/legitimate interest problem), but to make sure they cannot access other data they don’t have rights to. So should Facebook have access to do whatever they like without any control?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should Facebook get access to your account data, be able to do anything on a page or more? Whether you believe Facebook is safe or not is not important. Whatever you justify here for Facebook to have access to, you justify for any organisation, (so gambling, religious, policing, political, etc: why is an advertising company any better?) in any jurisdiction that the UK has a data protection relationship with and when it comes to the USA, that relationship is pretty terrible: the ICO rarely if ever does anything (beyond getting ‘promises’) when it comes to US  companies and in dialogue with them appears to not be able to regulate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For NHS users, please check this petition: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.change.org/p/uk-parliament-nhs-should-respect-privacy-online&quot;&gt;https://www.change.org/p/uk-parliament-nhs-should-respect-privacy-online&lt;/a&gt; as Facebook is not completely removed from their online services, only from some areas.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A world of free movement would be $78T richer</title>
<link>https://www.economist.com/the-world-if/2017/07/13/a-world-of-free-movement-would-be-78-trillion-richer</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.economist.com/the-world-if/2017/07/13/a-world-of-free-movement-would-be-78-trillion-richer</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A HUNDRED-DOLLAR BILL is lying on the ground. An economist walks past it. A friend asks the economist: “Didn’t you see the money there?” The economist replies: “I thought I saw something, but I must have imagined it. If there had been $100 on the ground, someone would have picked it up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If something seems too good to be true, it probably is not actually true. But occasionally it is. Michael Clemens, an economist at the Centre for Global Development, an anti-poverty think-tank in Washington, DC, argues that there are “trillion-dollar bills on the sidewalk”. One seemingly simple policy could make the world twice as rich as it is: open borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workers become far more productive when they move from a poor country to a rich one. Suddenly, they can join a labour market with ample capital, efficient firms and a predictable legal system. Those who used to scrape a living from the soil with a wooden hoe start driving tractors. Those who once made mud bricks by hand start working with cranes and mechanical diggers. Those who cut hair find richer clients who tip better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Labour is the world’s most valuable commodity—yet thanks to strict immigration regulation, most of it goes to waste,” argue Bryan Caplan and Vipul Naik in “A radical case for open borders”. Mexican labourers who migrate to the United States can expect to earn 150% more. Unskilled Nigerians make 1,000% more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Making Nigerians stay in Nigeria is as economically senseless as making farmers plant in Antarctica,” argue Mr Caplan and Mr Naik. And the non-economic benefits are hardly trivial, either. A Nigerian in the United States cannot be enslaved by the Islamists of Boko Haram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential gains from open borders dwarf those of, say, completely free trade, let alone foreign aid. Yet the idea is everywhere treated as a fantasy. In most countries fewer than 10% of people favour it. In the era of Brexit and Donald Trump, it is a political non-starter. Nonetheless, it is worth asking what might happen if borders were, indeed, open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To clarify, “open borders” means that people are free to move to find work. It does not mean “no borders” or “the abolition of the nation-state”. On the contrary, the reason why migration is so attractive is that some countries are well-run and others, abysmally so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workers in rich countries earn more than those in poor countries partly because they are better educated but mostly because they live in societies that have, over many years, developed institutions that foster prosperity and peace. It is very hard to transfer Canadian institutions to Cambodia, but quite straightforward for a Cambodian family to fly to Canada. The quickest way to eliminate absolute poverty would be to allow people to leave the places where it persists. Their poverty would thus become more visible to citizens of the rich world—who would see many more Liberians and Bangladeshis waiting tables and stacking shelves—but much less severe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If borders were open, how many people would up sticks? Gallup, a pollster, estimated in 2013 that 630m people—about 13% of the world’s population—would migrate permanently if they could, and even more would move temporarily. Some 138m would settle in the United States, 42m in Britain and 29m in Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gallup’s numbers could be an overestimate. People do not always do what they say they will. Leaving one’s homeland requires courage and resilience. Migrants must wave goodbye to familiar people, familiar customs and grandma’s cooking. Many people would rather not make that sacrifice, even for the prospect of large material rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wages are twice as high in Germany as in Greece, and under European Union rules Greeks are free to move to Germany, but only 150,000 have done so since the beginning of the economic crisis in 2010, out of a population of 11m. The weather is awful in Frankfurt, and hardly anyone speaks Greek. Even very large disparities combined with open borders do not necessarily lead to a mass exodus. Since 1986 the citizens of Micronesia have been allowed to live and work without a visa in the United States, where income per person is roughly 20 times higher. Yet two-thirds remain in Micronesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these caveats, it is a fair bet that open borders would lead to very large flows of people. The gap between rich and poor countries globally is much wider than the gap between the richest and less-rich countries within Europe, and most poor countries are not Pacific-island paradises. Many are violent as well as poor, or have oppressive governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, migration is, in the jargon, “path-dependent”. It starts with a trickle: the first person to move from country A to country B typically arrives in a place where no one speaks his language or knows the right way to cook noodles. But the second migrant—who may be his brother or cousin—has someone to show him around. As word spreads on the diaspora grapevine that country B is a good place to live, more people set off from country A. When the 1,000th migrant arrives, he finds a whole neighbourhood of his compatriots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the Gallup numbers could just as well be too low. Today there are 1.4bn people in rich countries and 6bn in not-so-rich ones. It is hardly far-fetched to imagine that, over a few decades, a billion or more of those people might emigrate if there were no legal obstacle to doing so. Clearly, this would transform rich countries in unpredictable ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voters in destination states typically do not mind a bit of immigration, but fret that truly open borders would lead to them being “swamped” by foreigners. This, they fear, would make life worse, and perhaps threaten the political system that made their country worth moving to in the first place. Mass migration, they worry, would bring more crime and terrorism, lower wages for locals, an impossible strain on welfare states, horrific overcrowding and traumatic cultural disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;xhead&quot;&gt;Open questions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If lots of people migrated from war-torn Syria, gangster-plagued Guatemala or chaotic Congo, would they bring mayhem with them? It is an understandable fear (and one that anti-immigrant politicians play on), but there is little besides conjecture and anecdotal evidence to support it. Granted, some immigrants commit crimes, or even headline-grabbing acts of terrorism. But in America the foreign-born are only a fifth as likely to be incarcerated as the native-born. In some European countries, such as Sweden, migrants are more likely to get into trouble than locals, but this is mostly because they are more likely to be young and male. A study of migration flows among 145 countries between 1970 and 2000 by researchers at the University of Warwick found that migration was more likely to reduce terrorism than increase it, largely because migration fosters economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would large-scale immigration make locals worse off economically? So far, it has not. Immigrants are more likely than the native-born to bring new ideas and start their own businesses, many of which hire locals. Overall, migrants are less likely than the native-born to be a drain on public finances, unless local laws make it impossible for them to work, as is the case for asylum-seekers in Britain. A large influx of foreign workers may slightly depress the wages of locals with similar skills. But most immigrants have different skills. Foreign doctors and engineers ease skills shortages. Unskilled migrants care for babies or the elderly, thus freeing the native-born to do more lucrative work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would open borders cause overcrowding? Perhaps, in popular cities like London. But most Western cities could build much higher than they do, creating more space. And mass migration would make the world as a whole less crowded, since fertility among migrants quickly plunges until it is much closer to the norm of their host country than their country of origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would mass immigration change the culture and politics of rich countries? Undoubtedly. Look at the way America has changed, mostly for the better, as its population soared from 5m mainly white folks in 1800 to 320m many-hued ones today. Still, that does not prove that future waves of immigration will be benign. Newcomers from illiberal lands might bring unwelcome customs, such as political corruption or intolerance for gay people. If enough of them came, they might vote for an Islamist government, or one that raises taxes on the native-born to pamper the newcomers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;xhead&quot;&gt;Eyes on the prize&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are certainly risks if borders are opened suddenly and without the right policies to help absorb the inflow. But nearly all these risks could be mitigated, and many of the most common objections overcome, with a bit of creative thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the worry is that immigrants will outvote the locals and impose an uncongenial government on them, one solution would be not to let immigrants vote—for five years, ten years or even a lifetime. This may seem harsh, but it is far kinder than not letting them in. If the worry is that future migrants might not pay their way, why not charge them more for visas, or make them pay extra taxes, or restrict their access to welfare benefits? Such levies could also be used to regulate the flow of migrants, thus avoiding big, sudden surges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds horribly discriminatory, and it is. But it is better for the migrants than the status quo, in which they are excluded from rich-world labour markets unless they pay tens of thousands of dollars to people-smugglers—and even then they must work in the shadows and are subject to sudden deportation. Today, millions of migrants work in the Gulf, where they have no political rights at all. Despite this, they keep coming. No one is forcing them to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Open borders would make foreigners trillions of dollars richer,” observes Mr Caplan. A thoughtful voter, even if he does not care about the welfare of foreigners, “should not say...‘So what?’ Instead, he should say, ‘Trillions of dollars of wealth are on the table. How can my countrymen get a hefty piece of the action?’ Modern governments routinely use taxes and transfers to redistribute from young to old and rich to poor. Why not use the same policy tools to redistribute from foreign to native?” If a world of free movement would be $78trn richer, should not liberals be prepared to make big political compromises to bring it about?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Web Assembly and Go: A look to the future</title>
<link>https://brianketelsen.com/web-assembly-and-go-a-look-to-the-future</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://brianketelsen.com/web-assembly-and-go-a-look-to-the-future</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It's no secret that I'm resistant to learning Javascript and frontend development. I learned HTML back before CSS was even a thing, and even Javascript came long after I started doing web development. When I look at modern web development I shudder; the ecosystem is so confusing for someone who has been out of touch as long as I have. Node, webpack, yarn, npm, frameworks, UMD, AMD, arghhh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been watching Web Assembly with anticipation for quite some time, with the hope that it would allow me to write web applications without the typical Javascript build process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Web Assembly(wasm) support &lt;a href=&quot;https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/102835&quot;&gt;landed&lt;/a&gt; in Go recently, I knew that the time was ripe for some experimentation. And I couldn't wait to dive in and try it. I read a few &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.owulveryck.info/2018/06/08/some-notes-about-the-upcoming-webassembly-support-in-go.html&quot;&gt;good&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/131vjr4DH6JFnb-blm_uRdaC0_Nv3OUwjEY5qVCxCup4/preview#heading=h.mjo1bish3xni&quot;&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; before diving in. This post will chronicle my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started with wasm in Go you need to checkout Go from source and build it. Web Assembly support will be released in Go 1.11, which isn't out yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find instructions &lt;a href=&quot;https://golang.org/doc/install/source&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on building Go from source. Because Go requires a working &lt;code&gt;go&lt;/code&gt; installation to bootstrap itself, you'll end up with two different installations of Go when you're done. &lt;em&gt;Caution - this could surprise you in ways you won't like if you don't remember that you've got two installs of Go. I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://direnv.net&quot;&gt;direnv&lt;/a&gt; to manage my path for each project so I can specify which Go installation I want to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After installing the latest Go, you're ready to experiment with Web Assembly. You'll need an HTML file, and a Javascript shim to load the wasm files that you produce. These are included in the &lt;code&gt;misc/wasm&lt;/code&gt; directory of your new Go installation. You can copy them into any new project and modify the HTML file to load your wasm output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first project was a bit ambitious, I wanted to build something that looks roughly like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webcomponents.org/&quot;&gt;Web Component&lt;/a&gt; in Go, compiled to Web Assembly. I didn't get that whole thing done, because I got distracted and excited by how well everything worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, I copied the HTML and Javascript files from &lt;code&gt;GOROOT/misc/wasm&lt;/code&gt; into a new directory and added a &lt;code&gt;main.go&lt;/code&gt; file. I started with the preconcieved notion that I would render my HTML into an existing node in the DOM that I declared in the HTML file. So I created an HTML &lt;code&gt;section&lt;/code&gt; tag with the ID of &lt;code&gt;thing&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    &amp;lt;section class=&quot;main&quot; id=&quot;thing&quot; &amp;gt;Please wait...&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I inserted this right above the script tags at the bottom of the HTML file. Next, I knew I would want to replace this node programatically, so I looked up the syntax to interact with the DOM from Go's wasm libraries. Go added a &lt;code&gt;syscall/js&lt;/code&gt; package that allows interaction with the DOM. I got a reference to the HTML node with the ID of &lt;code&gt;thing&lt;/code&gt; using this Go code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;     el := js.Global.Get(&quot;document&quot;).Call(&quot;getElementById&quot;, &quot;thing&quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I have a reference to the empty DOM node that I can populate with my rendered HTML. So the next step is to actually create some HTML and stuff it in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the famous TodoMVC app as my inspiration. I started by creating two files: &lt;code&gt;todo.go&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;todolist.go&lt;/code&gt;. These files contain Go structures that represent Todo items, and a list of Todo items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;type Todo struct {
        Title     string
        Completed bool
        //Root      js.Value
        tree *vdom.Tree
}

type TodoList struct {
        Todos []Todo
        Component
}

type Component struct {
        Name     string
        Root     js.Value
        Tree     *vdom.Tree
        Template string
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got a little cocky and started extracting things out into a &lt;code&gt;Component&lt;/code&gt; type thinking that I would be embedding it in my custom types to give them Web Component functionality. &lt;em&gt;I never finished this thought... you'll see why later in the article&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these custom Go types has a &lt;code&gt;Render()&lt;/code&gt; method and a template:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;var todolisttemplate = `&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
{{range $i, $x := $.Todos}} 
        {{$x.Render}} 
{{end}}
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;`
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;func (todoList *TodoList) Render() error {

        tmpl, err := template.New(&quot;todolist&quot;).Parse(todoList.Template)
        if err != nil {
                return err
        }
        // Execute the template with the given todo and write to a buffer
        buf := bytes.NewBuffer([]byte{})
        if err := tmpl.Execute(buf, todoList); err != nil {
                return err
        }
        // Parse the resulting html into a virtual tree
        newTree, err := vdom.Parse(buf.Bytes())
        if err != nil {
                return err
        }

        if todoList.Tree != nil {
                // Calculate the diff between this render and the last render
                //      patches, err := vdom.Diff(todo.tree, newTree)
}               //      if err != nil {
                //              return err
                //      }

                // Effeciently apply changes to the actual DOM
                //              if err := patches.Patch(todo.Root); err != nil {
                //                      return err
                //              }
        } else {

                todoList.Tree = newTree
        }
        // Remember the virtual DOM state for the next render to diff against
        todoList.Tree = newTree

        todoList.Root.Set(&quot;innerHTML&quot;, string(newTree.HTML()))
        return nil
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My idea was that I'd use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/albrow/vdom&quot;&gt;vdom&lt;/a&gt; package I found to do rendering so that the rendering would be more efficient. That's where I ran into my first snag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;differencesbetweengopherjsandgowasm&quot;&gt;Differences Between GopherJS and Go/wasm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vdom package was written for &lt;a href=&quot;https://gopherjs.org&quot;&gt;GopherJS&lt;/a&gt; which is a transpiler from Go to Javascript. GopherJS uses a type called &lt;code&gt;js.Object&lt;/code&gt; as the base of all its conversions. Go's new wasm library &lt;code&gt;syscall/js&lt;/code&gt; uses a type called &lt;code&gt;js.Value&lt;/code&gt;. They're similar in spirit, but very different in implementation. This meant that my vdom rendering idea was dead in the water until I ported vdom to use the new &lt;code&gt;js.Value&lt;/code&gt; type instead of &lt;code&gt;js.Object&lt;/code&gt;. The vdom's &lt;code&gt;tree.HTML()&lt;/code&gt; method did work without modification, though, so I was able to set the inner HTML of my HTML node to the output of the vdom's parsing. The Render() method parses the Go struct's template, passing an instance of the Go struct as the context. Then it uses the vdom library to create a parsed dom tree, and renders that tree in the last line of the method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;     todoList.Root.Set(&quot;innerHTML&quot;, string(newTree.HTML()))
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I had a working Go/wasm prototype that didn't have any events wired up. But it DID render to the dom and display in the browser. That was a huge first step; I was pretty excited at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built a Makefile so I wouldn't have to keep typing long build commands over and over:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;wasm2:
        GOROOT=~/gowasm GOARCH=wasm GOOS=js ~/gowasm/bin/go build -o example.wasm markdown.go

wasm:
        GOROOT=~/gowasm GOARCH=wasm GOOS=js ~/gowasm/bin/go build -o example.wasm .

build-server:
        go build -o server-app server/server.go

run: build-server wasm
        ./server-app
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The make file also points out a critical problem with the state of Web Assembly today. Modern browsers will ignore WASM files unless they're served with the proper MIME type. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.owulveryck.info/2018/06/08/some-notes-about-the-upcoming-webassembly-support-in-go.html&quot;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; had a simple HTTP file server that sets the right MIME type for web assembly files. I copied it into my project and use it to serve the app. If your web server does the right thing for &lt;code&gt;.wasm&lt;/code&gt; files, you don't need a custom server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;nerdsniped&quot;&gt;Nerd Sniped&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was at this point that I realized that Web Assembly worked really well, and maybe more importantly: much of the code for GopherJS would work with little or no modifications in Web Assembly. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/356/&quot;&gt;nerd sniped&lt;/a&gt; myself. The next thing I attempted was to take a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gopherjs/vecty&quot;&gt;vecty&lt;/a&gt; application and compile it. It failed pretty hard because vecty is written for GopherJS, and uses the &lt;code&gt;js.Object&lt;/code&gt; types instead of &lt;code&gt;js.Value&lt;/code&gt;. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gowasm/vecty&quot;&gt;forked vecty&lt;/a&gt; and made some modifications, some hacks, and commented out too much code to make vecty compile in wasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result was that the live markdown editor in the &lt;code&gt;vecty/examples&lt;/code&gt; folder runs beautifully in Web Assembly. This post is getting a little wordy, so I'll let you read the source &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bketelsen/wasmplay/tree/master/markdownvecty&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. TL;DR: it's almost exactly the same as the GopherJS version, but web assembly exits when main() exits, so I added an empty channel receive at the end of main() to prevent the exit and keep the app running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;events&quot;&gt;Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;syscall/js&lt;/code&gt; in Go uses a very different method of registering events. I had to modify vecty's &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gowasm/vecty/blob/wasm-wip/dom.go#L231&quot;&gt;event registration&lt;/a&gt; code to use the new wasm method of callback registration. It took me far too long to figure this out, but it works really well now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After playing with this for a few hours over the course of several evenings, I've decided that Web Assembly is the future of web development. It enables any language that can compile to wasm to be a &quot;frontend&quot; language. That's huge for old people like me who never really wanted to get into the Javascript ecosystem, and it's huge for all the languages that aren't Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can find the source code for these demo applications &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bketelsen/wasmplay&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Use at your own risk, it may destroy your computer, and it's definitely hacky code!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;byline byline--article&quot;&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencemag.org/author/lizzie-wade&quot;&gt;Lizzie Wade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;time&gt;Jun. 21, 2018 , 2:00 PM&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;The priest quickly sliced into the captive's torso and removed his still-beating heart. That sacrifice, one among thousands performed in the sacred city of Tenochtitlan, would feed the gods and ensure the continued existence of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death, however, was just the start of the victim's role in the sacrificial ritual, key to the spiritual world of the Mexica people in the 14th to the 16th centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priests carried the body to another ritual space, where they laid it face-up. Armed with years of practice, detailed anatomical knowledge, and obsidian blades sharper than today's surgical steel, they made an incision in the thin space between two vertebrae in the neck, expertly decapitating the body. Using their sharp blades, the priests deftly cut away the skin and muscles of the face, reducing it to a skull. Then, they carved large holes in both sides of the skull and slipped it onto a thick wooden post that held other skulls prepared in precisely the same way. The skulls were bound for Tenochtitlan's &lt;em&gt;tzompantli&lt;/em&gt;, an enormous rack of skulls built in front of the Templo Mayor—a pyramid with two temples on top. One was dedicated to the war god, Huitzilopochtli, and the other to the rain god, Tlaloc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, after months or years in the sun and rain, a skull would begin to fall to pieces, losing teeth and perhaps even its jaw. The priests would remove it to be fashioned into a mask and placed in an offering, or use mortar to add it to two towers of skulls that flanked the &lt;em&gt;tzompantli.&lt;/em&gt; For the Aztecs—the larger cultural group to which the Mexica belonged—those skulls were the seeds that would ensure the continued existence of humanity. They were a sign of life and regeneration, like the first flowers of spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Spanish conquistadors who marched into Tenochtitlan in 1519 saw them differently. For them, the skulls—and the entire practice of human sacrifice—evinced the Mexica's barbarism and justified laying waste to the city in 1521. The Spanish tore down the Templo Mayor and the &lt;em&gt;tzompantli&lt;/em&gt; in front of it, paved over the ruins, and built what would become Mexico City. And the great rack and towers of skulls passed into the realm of historical mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A codex written after the conquest by a Spanish priest depicts Tenochtitlan's enormous skull rack, or &lt;em&gt;tzompantli.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;1587 AZTEC MANUSCRIPT, THE CODEX TOVAR/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some conquistadors wrote about the &lt;em&gt;tzompantli&lt;/em&gt; and its towers, estimating that the rack alone contained 130,000 skulls. But historians and archaeologists knew the conquistadors were prone to exaggerating the horrors of human sacrifice to demonize the Mexica culture. As the centuries passed, scholars began to wonder whether the &lt;em&gt;tzompantli&lt;/em&gt; had ever existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists at the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) here can now say with certainty that it did. Beginning in 2015, they discovered and excavated the remains of the skull rack and one of the towers underneath a colonial period house on the street that runs behind Mexico City's cathedral. (The other tower, they suspect, lies under the cathedral's back courtyard.) The scale of the rack and tower suggests they held thousands of skulls, testimony to an industry of human sacrifice unlike any other in the world. Now, archaeologists are beginning to study the skulls in detail, hoping to learn more about Mexica rituals and the postmortem treatment of the bodies of the sacrificed. The researchers also wonder who the victims were, where they lived, and what their lives were like before they ended up marked for a brutal death at the Templo Mayor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a world of information,&quot; says archaeologist Raùl Barrera Rodríguez, director of INAH's Urban Archaeology Program and leader of the team that found the &lt;em&gt;tzompantli.&lt;/em&gt; &quot;It's an amazing thing, and just the kind of discovery many of us had hoped for,&quot; agrees John Verano, a bioarchaeologist at Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana, who studies human sacrifice. He and other researchers hope the skulls will clarify the role of large-scale human sacrifice in Mexica religion and culture—and whether, as scholars suspect, it played a key part in building their empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of the &lt;em&gt;tzompantli&lt;/em&gt; began the same way all the Urban Archaeology Program's digs do: with a planned construction project in the heart of downtown Mexico City. Whenever someone wants to build in a seven-block area around the Templo Mayor, Barrera Rodríguez's team must excavate first, salvaging whatever remains of the colonial and especially Mexica city beneath. The finds are often significant and surprisingly intact. The Templo Mayor itself came to light in the 1970s, when INAH archaeologists were called in after city electrical workers stumbled on an imposing circular statue of the goddess Coyolxauhqui, who was killed and dismembered by her brother Huitzilopochtli.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists have now discovered and excavated the remains of &lt;em&gt;tzompantli&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;RAÚL BARRERA RODRÍGUEZ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the temple had survived to be discovered. The Mexica built it in seven phases between 1325 and 1521, each corresponding to the reign of a king. Each phase was built over and around the earlier ones, embedding the Templo Mayor's history within it like a set of Russian nesting dolls. Although the Spanish destroyed the temple's final phase, the smaller temples from earlier reigns were paved over but left relatively unscathed. Those ruins are now part of the Templo Mayor Museum. But many structures that surrounded the ruins remained hidden beneath the dense colonial city—and now, the modern megalopolis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when Barrera Rodríguez got the call to excavate a site just a few buildings down from where Guatemala Street dead-ends into the Templo Mayor complex, he knew the dig could lead to a major discovery. Starting in February 2015, his team dug about 20 test pits, unearthing modern debris, colonial porcelain, and, finally, the basalt slabs of a Mexica period floor. Then, he remembers, &quot;Hundreds of skull fragments began to appear.&quot; In more than 2 decades of excavating in downtown Mexico City, he had never seen anything like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barrera Rodríguez and INAH archaeologist and field supervisor Lorena Vázquez Vallín knew from colonial maps of Tenochtitlan that the &lt;em&gt;tzompantli&lt;/em&gt;, if it existed, could be somewhere near their dig. But they weren't sure that's what they were seeing until they found the postholes for the skull rack. The wooden posts themselves had long since decayed, and the skulls once displayed on them had shattered—or been purposely crushed by the conquistadors. Still, the size and spacing of the holes allowed them to estimate the &lt;em&gt;tzompantli&lt;/em&gt;'s size: an imposing rectangular structure, 35 meters long and 12 to 14 meters wide, slightly larger than a basketball court, and likely 4 to 5 meters high. From their knowledge of the eras of the Templo Mayor, archaeologists estimate that the particular phases of the &lt;em&gt;tzompantli&lt;/em&gt; they found were likely built between 1486 and 1502, although human sacrifice had been practiced in Tenochtitlan since its founding in 1325.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;figure__hed&quot;&gt;Sacrifice city&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Mexica, human sacrifice was key to the health of the world. Recent finds show that a vast rack of skulls (reconstruction below) stood in a temple at the heart of their capital, Tenochtitlan.&lt;/p&gt;

At its apex, the city had a population of about 250,000 and was the seat of an empire that stretched to southern Mexico. The temple complex in the middle of the island was the political and religious heart of the city state. The island capital of Tenochtitlan Most sacrifices in Tenochtitlan were performed inpublic at the top of the Templo Mayor. The sacrificesplayed a vital role in the Mexica’s cosmology,and may have also helped the young empire control conquered populations. 1 Templo Mayor Built from skulls and mortar, towers at least 1.7 meters tall and likely taller flanked the tzompantli.

&lt;p&gt;Nearby, the researchers also found skulls apparently stuck together with mortar—remnants of one of the towers flanking the &lt;em&gt;tzompantli&lt;/em&gt;, where most skulls once exhibited on its posts ended their postmortem journey. The team spent a second season, from October 2016 to June 2017, excavating the &lt;em&gt;tzompantli&lt;/em&gt; and the tower. At its largest, the tower was nearly 5 meters in diameter and at least 1.7 meters tall. Combining the two historically documented towers and the rack, INAH archaeologists now estimate that several thousand skulls must have been displayed at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Mesoamerican cultures also engaged in human sacrifice and built &lt;em&gt;tzompantlis.&lt;/em&gt; But, &quot;The Mexica certainly brought this to an extreme,&quot; says Vera Tiesler, a bioarchaeologist at the Autonomous University of Yucatán in Mérida, Mexico. In her work at the Mayan city of Chichen Itza, founded some 700 years before Tenochtitlan and more than 1000 kilometers away, she found six skulls with holes in their sides that she suspects were once displayed on the posts of a &lt;em&gt;tzompantli.&lt;/em&gt; However, the holes in each skull were less regular and uniform than those in the Tenochtitlan skulls. &quot;That makes me think it was not a standardized practice yet,&quot; she says. &quot;Tenochtitlan was the maximum expression [of the &lt;em&gt;tzompantli&lt;/em&gt; tradition].&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human sacrifice occupied a particularly important place in Mesoamerica. Many of the region's cultures, including the Maya and the Mexica, believed that human sacrifice nourished the gods. Without it, the sun would cease to rise and the world would end. And sacrificial victims earned a special, honored place in the afterlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/336/6083/834&quot;&gt;Ritual killings in traditional cultures elsewhere in the world, including Asia and Europe, point to additional roles for the practice&lt;/a&gt;, and may help explain why the Mexica took it to such an extreme. &quot;All premodern societies make some kind of offering,&quot; Verano says. &quot;And in many societies, if not all, the most valuable sacrifice is human life.&quot; Social scientists who study religion have shown that costly offerings and painful rituals, such as the bloodletting ceremonies the Mexica also practiced, &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/918&quot;&gt;can help define and strengthen group identity&lt;/a&gt;—especially in societies that have grown too large for everyone to know everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the skulls displayed on the &lt;em&gt;tzompantli&lt;/em&gt; were transformed into masks; this one's nose is an obsidian blade like those used in human sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;MOSTARDI PHOTOGRAPHY/ALAMY STOCK PHOTO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some researchers also argue that killing captives or subjects both establishes and reinforces hierarchy in large, complex societies. A 2016 &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; paper, for example, linked human sacrifice to the development of social stratification in dozens of traditional Austronesian cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many researchers say that, for the Mexica, political power as well as religious belief is likely key to understanding the scale of the practice. Theirs was a relatively young empire; during their 200-year reign, they conquered territory all over central and southern Mexico, sometimes facing tremendous resistance from local communities (some of which would later ally with the Spanish against the empire). &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6330/1114&quot;&gt;Spanish chronicles describe Tenochtitlan's sacrificial victims as captives brought back from wars&lt;/a&gt;, such as those fought with their archenemy, the nearby republic of Tlaxcala. Subject peoples in the Mexica Empire were also sometimes required to send individuals as tribute. &quot;The killing of captives, even in a ritual context, is a strong political statement,&quot; Verano says. &quot;It's a way to demonstrate power and political influence—and, some people have said, it's a way to control your own population.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The more powerful a state was, the more victims it could dedicate,&quot; says Ximena Chávez Balderas, an INAH bioarchaeologist who spent years studying the remains of sacrificial victims in offerings in the Templo Mayor; she is now Verano's doctoral student at Tulane. The religious significance and political messaging of human sacrifice &quot;go hand in hand,&quot; she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over two seasons of excavations, INAH archaeologists collected 180 mostly complete skulls from the tower as well as thousands of skull fragments. Now, those finds sit in a lab next to the Templo Mayor ruins, being painstakingly examined by a team led by INAH anthropologist Jorge Gómez Valdés. Cut marks on the skulls leave no doubt they were defleshed after death, and the decapitation technique appears clean and uniform. &quot;[Mexica priests] had extremely impressive anatomical knowledge, which was passed down from generation to generation,&quot; Chávez Balderas says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) archaeologists collected nearly 200 skulls from the tower flanking the &lt;em&gt;tzompantli&lt;/em&gt;. Isotope and DNA studies, now underway, are expected to reveal that victims came from all over Mesoamerica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;HÉCTOR MONTAÑO/INAH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gomóz Valdás found that about 75% of the skulls examined so far belonged to men, most between the ages of 20 and 35—prime warrior age. But 20% were women, and 5% belonged to children. Most victims seemed to be in relatively good health before they were sacrificed. &quot;If they are war captives, they aren't randomly grabbing the stragglers,&quot; Gómez Valdés says. The mix of ages and sexes also supports another Spanish claim, that many victims were slaves sold in the city's markets expressly to be sacrificed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chávez Balderas identified a similar distribution of sex and age in her studies of victims in smaller offerings within the Templo Mayor itself, which often contained skulls from the &lt;em&gt;tzompantli&lt;/em&gt; that had been decorated and turned into eerie masks. Her colleagues also analyzed isotopes of strontium and oxygen that the teeth and bones had absorbed. The isotopes in teeth reflect the geology of a person's surroundings during childhood, whereas isotopes in bones show where a person lived before death. The results confirmed that the victims were born in various parts of Mesoamerica but had often spent significant time in Tenochtitlan before they were sacrificed. &quot;They aren't foreigners who were brought into the city and directly to the ritual,&quot; Chávez Balderas says. &quot;They were assimilated into the society of Tenochtitlan in some way.&quot; Barrera Rodríguez says some historical accounts record cases of captive warriors living with the families of their captors for months or years before being sacrificed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samples for isotopic analysis as well as ancient DNA studies have already been taken from many of the &lt;em&gt;tzompantli&lt;/em&gt; skulls, Gómez Valdés says. He, too, expects to find a diversity of origins, especially because the &lt;em&gt;tzompantli&lt;/em&gt; skulls display a variety of intentional dental and cranial modifications, which were practiced by different cultural groups at different times. If so, the skulls could yield information that extends far beyond how the victims died. &quot;Hypothetically, in this &lt;em&gt;tzompantli&lt;/em&gt;, you have a sample of the population from all over Mesoamerica,&quot; Vázquez Vallín says. &quot;It's unparalleled.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bioarchaeologist Tiffiny Tung of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, who studies human sacrifice in the Andes, says she is excited to see what the INAH team can learn from the skulls about sacrificial rituals and the genetic diversity of Mesoamerica just before the conquest. &quot;We can go down literally to the individual person and tell that person's story. And then we can pull back and tell the story … about these big communities,&quot; she says. Once imbued with a sacred, but silent, role in the city where they died, those victims may finally speak again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Sleep Foundation recommends &lt;a href=&quot;https://sleepfoundation.org/press-release/national-sleep-foundation-recommends-new-sleep-times&quot;&gt;an average of eight hours&lt;/a&gt; of sleep per night for adults, but sleep scientist Matthew Walker says that too many people are falling short of the mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Human beings are the only species that deliberately deprive themselves of sleep for no apparent gain,&quot; Walker says. &quot;Many people walk through their lives in an underslept state, not realizing it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walker is the director of the Center for Human Sleep Science at the University of California, Berkeley. He points out that lack of sleep — defined as six hours or fewer — can have serious consequences. Sleep deficiency is associated with problems in concentration, memory and the immune system, and may even shorten life span.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Every disease that is killing us in developed nations has causal and significant links to a lack of sleep,&quot; he says. &quot;So that classic maxim that you may [have] heard that you can sleep when you're dead, it's actually mortally unwise advice from a very serious standpoint.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walker discusses the importance of sleep — and offers strategies for getting the recommended eight hours — in his new book, &lt;em&gt;Why We Sleep.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interview Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On what you should do if you can't sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should not actually stay in bed for very long awake, because your brain is this remarkably associative device and it quickly learns that the bed is about being awake. So you should go to another room — a room that's dim. Just read a book — no screens, no phones — and only when you're sleepy return to the bed. And that way your brain relearns the association with your bedroom being about sleep rather than wakefulness. ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing that people can do if you don't want to get up and go to a different room is actually try meditating. ... Being quite a stoic, hard-nosed scientist, I actually didn't really believe the data [about meditation as a sleep aid], even though the data is very strong. And I started doing it myself, particularly when I was traveling with jet lag, and I found it to be very effective. ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just quiets the mind and it dampens down what we call the &quot;fight or flight&quot; branch of the nervous system, which is one of the key features of insomnia. And that can really have some efficacious benefits too. So that's another solution if people would choose not to go to a different room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On whether you can make up for a sleep deficit by sleeping longer another day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're trying to sleep off a debt that you've lumbered your brain and body with during the week, and wouldn't it be lovely if sleep worked like that? Sadly it doesn't. Sleep is not like the bank, so you can't accumulate a debt and then try and pay it off at a later point in time. And the reason is this: We know that if I were to deprive you of sleep for an entire night — take away eight hours — and then in the subsequent night I give you all of the sleep that you want, however much you wish to consume, you never get back all that you lost. You will sleep longer, but you will never achieve that full eight-hour repayment, as it were. So the brain has no capacity to get back that lost sleep that you've been lumbering it with during the week in terms of a debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On letting teenagers sleep on weekends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res558086309&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage429933655&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/08/06/429933655/states-havent-embraced-later-school-start-times-for-teens&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/health-shots\/2015\/08\/06\/429933655\/states-havent-embraced-later-school-start-times-for-teens&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2015/08/06/istock_000022330868large_sq-04c95933f6af0f8f9c4cf94313d32cd9f9bbeb7e-s100-c15.jpg&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2015/08/06/istock_000022330868large_sq-04c95933f6af0f8f9c4cf94313d32cd9f9bbeb7e-s100.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;States Haven't Embraced Later School Start Times For Teens&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents will often pull the covers off their teenager [on] weekends and say, &quot;It's daylight out! It's noon! You're wasting the day!&quot; And that's wrong for two reasons. ... It's not their fault; it's their biology that wants them to be asleep at that time. But it's more than that, because it also turns out that they are trying to sleep off a debt that we have actually saddled them with by way of this incessant model of early school start times. We have to abandon that attitude and we also have to change the educational practice as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On how the quantity and quality of sleep decreases with age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of sleep — the total amount of sleep that you get — starts to decrease the older that we get. I think one of the myths out there is that we simply need less sleep as we age, and that's not true, in fact. We need just as much sleep in our 60s, 70s [and] 80s, as we do when we're in our 40s. It's simply that the brain is not capable of generating that sleep, which it still needs, and the body still needs. So, total amount of sleep actually decreases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res558088139&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage460620606&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/01/04/460620606/lack-of-deep-sleep-may-set-the-stage-for-alzheimers&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/health-shots\/2016\/01\/04\/460620606\/lack-of-deep-sleep-may-set-the-stage-for-alzheimers&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2015/12/23/mri-alzheimers-2_sq-e8361516c7e24530ce35e3e4aac355cd37bf1310-s100-c15.jpg&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2015/12/23/mri-alzheimers-2_sq-e8361516c7e24530ce35e3e4aac355cd37bf1310-s100.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;Lack Of Deep Sleep May Set The Stage For Alzheimer's&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also know that the continuity of sleep also starts to fall apart. Sleep becomes much more fragmented. There are many more awakenings throughout the night — pain, bathroom trips, etc. But we also know that it's not the quantity of sleep that changes with aging, it's also the quality of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to be particularly the deepest stage of sleep — something that we call non-rapid-eye-movement sleep, or non-REM sleep, the very deepest stages of non-REM sleep — those are selectively eroded by the aging process. By the time you're in your 50s, you've perhaps lost almost 40 to 50 percent of that deep sleep you were having, for example, when you were a teenager. By age 70, you may have lost almost 90 percent of that deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On using sleeping pills, like&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/tags/169044285/ambien&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambien&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, to sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the current set or classes of sleeping pills that we have do not produce naturalistic sleep. So they are all a broad set of chemicals that we call the sedative hypnotics, and sedation is not sleep, it's very different. It doesn't give you the restorative natural benefits of sleep. ... If you look at the electrical signature of sleep that you have when you're taking those medications, it's not the same as a normal night of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On how caffeine affects sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res558086590&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage513060769&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/02/02/513060769/not-getting-enough-sleep-camping-in-february-might-help&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/health-shots\/2017\/02\/02\/513060769\/not-getting-enough-sleep-camping-in-february-might-help&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/02/02/camping_sq-5fd4d7d9b20cf1fca205df6a79872e96601078d6-s100-c15.jpg&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/02/02/camping_sq-5fd4d7d9b20cf1fca205df6a79872e96601078d6-s100.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;Not Getting Enough Sleep? Camping In February Might Help&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, and most obvious for some people, is that it stops you falling asleep. Some people, however, say, &quot;I can have a cup of coffee after dinner and I fall asleep just fine, so I'm not one of those people that is sensitive to caffeine.&quot; And that's quite dangerous, because we also know that even if you can fall asleep, the depth of the sleep that you have when caffeine is swilling around within the brain is not going to be as deep anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So people may wake up the next morning, they'll feel unrefreshed. They'll start to reach for the coffeepot earlier. They'll drink more caffeine, never having realized that it was the cup of coffee last night that has left you feeling underslept, because they didn't wake up during the night, they didn't have problems falling asleep, but caffeine can still have that deleterious impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On alcohol's effect on sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol ... is a sedative drug, and what you're doing there is simply knocking yourself out. You are removing consciousness quickly from the brain by way of having alcohol, but you're not putting yourself into naturalistic sleep. The other issue is that alcohol will fragment your sleep — it will litter it and punctuate it with many more awakenings throughout the night, so short ... that you tend not to remember them. So, once again, you're not quite aware of how bad your sleep was when you had alcohol in the system. The final aspect of alcohol is that it is very good at blocking your REM sleep, or your dream sleep, which is critical for aspects of mental health within the brain and emotional restitution too. So alcohol [is a] very misunderstood drug when it comes to sleep — not helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Filezilla installer is suspicious again</title>
<link>https://forum.filezilla-project.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=48441</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://forum.filezilla-project.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=48441</guid>
<description>I'm seeing hits on this file as well from advanced security tools in an enterprise environment. This appears to be a bit more than just a few false hits on VirusTotal. The installation of filezilla_3.29.0_win64-setup_bundled.exe file with MD5 of 9f405c266c883305537c11246bdb1d42 shows signs of malicious activity in the form of IDS/IPS bypass techniques to copy and append .dat files behind the scenes. This activity can sometimes be a false positive, but this does not appear to be a false hit.&lt;p&gt;The most suspicious part of the install we see is the spawning of an unsigned, unidentified process called tofufeti.exe which then spawns dozens of cmd.exe prompts to append these .dat files together after itself being put together by .dat file copy and appends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See attached screenshot for the process chain we see spawning off of filezilla_3.29.0_win64-setup_bundled.exe. Each cmd.exe process expands into another chain of cmd.exe and conhost.exe processes to perform cleanup of the temp .dat files. None of this seems necessary for a simple FileZilla installation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you comment on what exactly tofufeti.exe is and why this unique unsigned process is seen connecting to multiple IP's with no real content when installing the &quot;clean&quot; version of this software downloaded directly from the source?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IP's and domains we see tofufeti.exe connecting to are:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;54.225.173.220 on tcp/80 (goquc.com)&lt;br/&gt;52.84.25.26 on tcp/80 (d39ievd5spb5kl.cloudfront.net)&lt;br/&gt;34.208.177.52 on tcp/80 (gubuh.com)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Random unsigned processes reaching out to random sites with no content over port 80 is typically a sign of malware beaconing.&lt;p&gt;Running the install without choosing any of the bundled adware shows no signs of this activity and is a simple and clean install that one would expect for a lightweight tool like FileZilla. So i don't think this is FileZilla's doing exactly, more that the bundled software in this bundle download appears to be typical adware garbage, but with a serious risk of turning into something far more severe via the ability to download other malicious files in small chunks and put them together after bypassing perimeter defenses. This technique is discussed in depth here: (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.carbonblack.com/2016/09/23/security-advisory-variants-well-known-adware-families-discovered-include-sophisticated-obfuscation-techniques-previously-associated-nation-state-attacks/&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot;&gt;https://www.carbonblack.com/2016/09/23/ ... e-attacks/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd appreciate any comments that could shed light on what we're seeing as this does not appear to be a misunderstanding of VirusTotal scanners, but an actual advanced attack by the bundled adware in this install package, although I'd love to be proven wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

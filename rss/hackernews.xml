<title>NYC Mesh – community-owned network to replace your current internet connection</title>
<link>https://nycmesh.net/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://nycmesh.net/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Our network consists of Wi-Fi router “nodes”, “supernodes” and fiber spread throughout the city. The network connects directly to the internet backbone, so we do not rely on an ISP. All of our network nodes cooperate in the distribution of data, and the network can also function independently in case of emergencies or internet shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NYC Mesh is a neutral network that does not block or discriminate content. NYC Mesh does not collect, store, monitor, or log any user traffic or content that passes through our network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can connect whole buildings by wireless for speeds between 80 Mbps up to 1 Gbps, or by fiber at 20 Gbps (20,000 Mbps). The buildings we are currently planning include co-ops, a school and housing association buildings. Fiber involves an install fee and a monthly rental. For a quote, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:install@nycmesh.net&quot;&gt;email us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a network operator, please consider peering with our open network to provide bandwidth! (&lt;a href=&quot;https://nycmesh.net/peering&quot;&gt;Our peering policy&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our mission&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aim to create an open, resilient, neutral network that serves both for daily internet use, and for emergency use during power outages or internet disruption, running software that helps our community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=glW_S9bKAHk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://nycmesh.net/assets/images/connect_thumb02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;How to connect to NYC Mesh&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;312&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>DuckDuckGo Raises $10M</title>
<link>https://news.crunchbase.com/news/while-google-is-attacked-over-privacy-concerns-and-perceived-bias-duckduckgo-raised-10m/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://news.crunchbase.com/news/while-google-is-attacked-over-privacy-concerns-and-perceived-bias-duckduckgo-raised-10m/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;entry-content herald-entry-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early hours of the morning, Google found itself in President Trump’s timeline being &lt;a href=&quot;https://money.cnn.com/2018/08/28/technology/donald-trump-google-rigged/index.html&quot;&gt;accused of biased search results&lt;/a&gt;. While the search giant denies those claims, Google has also faced criticism over privacy concerns. For &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/duck-duck-go&quot;&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt;, it represents yet another opportunity to convert users, and now it has a tidy amount of cash from investors to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow Crunchbase News on&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/crunchbasenews&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the only private search alternatives to Google, the privacy-focused DuckDuckGo quietly raised $10 million from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/omers-ventures#section-overview&quot;&gt;OMERS Ventures&lt;/a&gt; last week, a Canadian pension fund that has invested &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organizations/num_investments/omers-ventures&quot;&gt;in a number of startups&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.searchenginejournal.com/duckduckgo-receives-10m-financing-to-expand-global-impact/266199/&quot;&gt;Search Engine Journal,&lt;/a&gt; there was little need for the company to raise more money. DuckDuckGo, which had a last known &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/duck-duck-go-series-unknown--5d9c6644&quot;&gt;raise of $3 million in 2011&lt;/a&gt;, has been profitable since 2014. However, the new funding could help DuckDuckGo expand its education-based campaigns concerning the privacy of search engines. The company has also developed a privacy app that &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/QNfnevM3gf&quot;&gt;blocks scripts from tracking visitors&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s possible more privacy-focused applications are in the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, $10 million is not a substantial amount of money when competing against Google. But for those looking for alternatives to Google, DuckDuckGo appears healthy and quite content with making &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-revenue-generation-model-for-DuckDuckGo/answer/Gabriel-Weinberg&quot;&gt;money off of keyword-based ads&lt;/a&gt; alone.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Go 2 Draft Designs</title>
<link>https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/go2draft.md</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/go2draft.md</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;As part of the Go 2 design process, we’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.golang.org/go2draft&quot;&gt;published these draft designs&lt;/a&gt; to start community discussions about three topics: generics, error handling, and error value semantics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These draft designs are not proposals in the sense of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://golang.org/s/proposal&quot;&gt;Go proposal process&lt;/a&gt;. They are starting points for discussion, with an eventual goal of producing designs good enough to be turned into actual proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the draft designs is accompanied by a “problem overview” (think “cover letter”). The problem overview is meant to provide context; to set the stage for the actual design docs, which of course present the design details; and to help frame and guide discussion about the designs. It presents background, goals, non-goals, design constraints, a brief summary of the design, a short discussion of what areas we think most need attention, and comparison with previous approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, these are draft designs, not official proposals. There are not associated proposal issues. We hope all Go users will help us improve them and turn them into Go proposals. We have established a wiki page to collect and organize feedback about each topic. Please help us keep those pages up to date, including by adding links to your own feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Error handling&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Error values&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generics&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Insured, but Still Owing $109K for a Heart Attack</title>

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;nosyndication&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;em&gt;UPDATE: This story has an addendum reflecting the hospital’s latest settlement offer.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drew Calver took out his trash cans and then waved goodbye to his wife, Erin, as she left for the grocery store the morning that upended his picture-perfect life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minutes later, the popular high school history teacher and swim coach in Austin, Texas, collapsed in his bedroom from a heart attack. He pounded his fist on the bed frame, violent chest pains pinning him to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I thought I was dying,” the 44-year-old father recalled. He called out to the only other person in the house, his oldest daughter, Eleanor, now 7. Using his voice, he texted his wife, who was at the store with their youngest, Emory, now 6. A neighbor rushed him to the nearby emergency room at St. David’s Medical Center on April 2, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ER doctors confirmed the trauma to Calver’s heart and admitted him to the hospital’s cardiac unit. The next day, doctors implanted stents in his clogged “widow-maker” artery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heart attack was a shock for Calver, an avid swimmer who had competed in an Ironman triathlon just five months before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the surprise, even from his hospital bed, Calver asked whether his health insurance would cover all of this, a financial worry that accompanies nearly every American hospital stay. He was concerned because St. David’s is out-of-network on his school district health plan. The hospital told him not to worry and that they would accept his insurance, Calver said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hospital charged $164,941 for his surgery and four days in the hospital. Aetna, which administers health benefits for the Austin Independent School District, paid the hospital $55,840, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4777762-Calver-BOTM-Hospital-Charges.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;records show&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the difference of more than $100,000, with the hospital’s prior assurance, Calver believed he would not bear much, if any, out-of-pocket payment for his life-threatening emergency and the surgery that saved him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the bills came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patient:&lt;/strong&gt; Drew Calver, 44, a high school history teacher and father of two in Austin, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Bill:&lt;/strong&gt; $164,941 for a four-day hospital stay, including $42,944 for four stents and $10,920 for room charges. Calver’s insurer paid $55,840. The hospital billed Calver for the unpaid balance of $108,951.31.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service Provider:&lt;/strong&gt; St. David’s HealthCare, a large hospital system in central Texas. It’s run by HCA Healthcare, the nation’s largest for-profit hospital chain, and two nonprofit foundations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical Treatment:&lt;/strong&gt; Emergency room treatment followed by four days in the hospital, most of it spent in the cardiac unit. During surgery, four stents were implanted to clear a blockage in his left anterior descending artery, the source of so-called widow-maker heart attacks, because they are so frequently deadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Gives:&lt;/strong&gt; St. David’s Medical Center is billing Calver for the $109,000 balance — an amount nearly twice his annual pay as a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hospital’s billing company sent a notice June 26, urging him to take advantage of this “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4777829-Calver-BOTM-June-2018-Letter.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;FINAL opportunity to settle your balance.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re going to give me another heart attack stressing over this bill,” Calver said. “I can’t pay this bill on my teacher salary, and I don’t want this to go to a debt collector.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of his heart attack, Calver fell victim to twin medical billing practices that increasingly bedevil many Americans, even as legislators have tried to protect them: surprise bills and balance billing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprise bills occur when a patient goes to a hospital in his insurance network but receives treatment from a doctor that does not participate in the network, resulting in a direct bill to the patient. They can also occur in cases like Calver’s, where insurers will pay for needed emergency care at the closest hospital — even if it is out-of-network — but the hospital and the insurer may not agree on a reasonable price. The hospital then demands that patients pay the difference, in a practice called balance billing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;side-by-side&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;alignleft wp-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;770&quot; height=&quot;513&quot; src=&quot;https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/botm_aug_06_1350.jpg?w=770&amp;amp;h=513&amp;amp;crop=1&quot; class=&quot;attachment-khn-article-large size-khn-article-large&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;The total bill for Drew Calver’s four-day hospital stay at St. David’s Medical Center in April 2017 was $164,941.&lt;span class=&quot;photo-credit&quot;&gt;(Callie Richmond for KHN)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;alignright wp-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;770&quot; height=&quot;513&quot; src=&quot;https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/botm_aug_08_13501.jpg?w=770&amp;amp;h=513&amp;amp;crop=1&quot; class=&quot;attachment-khn-article-large size-khn-article-large&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;His insurer paid $55,840, leaving Calver responsible for the unpaid balance of $108,951.31.&lt;span class=&quot;photo-credit&quot;&gt;(Callie Richmond for KHN)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several states, including Texas (as well as New York, California and New Jersey) have passed laws to help shield consumers from surprise bills and balance billing, particularly for emergency care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://californiahealthline.org/news/for-millions-of-insured-californians-state-health-laws-dont-apply/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a huge loophole&lt;/a&gt;: Those state-mandated protections don’t apply to people, like the Calver family, who get their health coverage from employers that are self-insured, meaning the companies or public employers pay claims out of their own funds.  Federal law governs those health plans — and it does not include such protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kff.org/report-section/ehbs-2017-section-10-plan-funding/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;60 percent&lt;/a&gt; of people with employer health benefits are covered by self-insured plans, but many don’t even know it, since employers typically hire an insurer to administer the plan and employees carry a card bearing the name of Blue Cross Blue Shield or another major insurer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_866039&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-866039&quot; src=&quot;https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/botm_aug_01_1350.jpg?w=450&amp;amp;h=675&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;675&quot; srcset=&quot;https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/botm_aug_01_1350.jpg?w=450&amp;amp;h=675 450w, https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/botm_aug_01_1350.jpg?w=900&amp;amp;h=1350 900w, https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/botm_aug_01_1350.jpg?w=100&amp;amp;h=150 100w, https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/botm_aug_01_1350.jpg?w=333&amp;amp;h=500 333w, https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/botm_aug_01_1350.jpg?w=768&amp;amp;h=1151 768w, https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/botm_aug_01_1350.jpg?w=847&amp;amp;h=1270 847w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Drew Calver sits with his wife, Erin, and daughters Eleanor (left) and Emory (middle) in their Austin, Texas, home where he had a heart attack on April 2, 2017.&lt;span class=&quot;photo-credit&quot;&gt;(Callie Richmond for KHN)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case “illustrates the dangers that even insured people face,” said Carol Lucas, an attorney in Los Angeles with experience in health care payment disputes. “The unfairness is especially acute when there is an emergency and the patient, who might ordinarily be completely compliant, has no say about the facility he winds up in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/botm-hospital-statement.pdf&quot;&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;, St. David’s HealthCare defended its handling of Calver’s bill and sought to blame the school district and Aetna for offering such a narrow network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While we did everything right in this particular situation, the structure of the patient’s insurance plan as a narrow network product placed a large portion of the financial responsibility directly on the patient because our hospital was not in-network,” the hospital said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients experiencing an emergency are particularly at risk of landing at an out-of-network hospital. St. David’s said once ER patients are deemed stable, it tries to transfer them to an in-network facility. “However, this is not always possible because the patient’s health must come first,” the hospital said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case also raises questions about the validity of the hospital’s charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry analysts and consumer advocates say St. David’s has a reputation for exorbitant billing and for trying to collect big payouts as an out-of-network provider. “This is a well-known, problematic provider. We’ve seen multiple bills from them and they are always highly inflated,” said Dr. Merrit Quarum, chief executive of WellRithms, which scrutinizes medical bills for self-funded employers and other clients nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WellRithms reviewed Calver’s bill in detail at the request of Kaiser Health News and determined that a reasonable reimbursement would have been $26,985. That’s less than half &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4777764-Calver-BOTM-Aetna-EOB.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;what Aetna paid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthcare Bluebook, which offers cost estimates for medical tests and treatments, arrived at a similar conclusion. It said a fair price for a hospitalization in Austin involving four heart stents would be about $36,800. St. David’s Medical Center charged four times that amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quarum and other analysts who reviewed the bill said several charges stood out, especially on the four stents, which were billed at $42,944. Coronary stents are typically metal mesh tubes implanted in arteries to improve blood flow. Most are coated with drugs to assist in healing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;St. David’s charged $19,708 apiece for two Synergy stents made by device giant Boston Scientific. Two other stents used were far cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $20,000 price tag represents a significant markup of what U.S. hospitals typically pay themselves for stents. The median price paid by hospitals for the Synergy stent was $1,153 over the past year, according to the nonprofit research firm ECRI Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“St. David’s charge of over $19,000 for those stents is absolutely outrageous,” Quarum said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St. David’s declined to comment on its markup for the stents or what it actually paid the manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolution:&lt;/strong&gt; For now, Calver still faces a bill for $108,951.31, with none of the parties involved in his treatment or coverage providing significant redress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the hospital’s debt collector &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4777791-Calver-BOTM-August-2018-Letter.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;sent the Calvers a letter Aug. 3&lt;/a&gt; demanding payment in full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a reporter made inquiries, St. David’s said collection efforts were put on hold, and a hospital representative called Calver, offering to help him apply for a discount based on his income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, St. David’s said “we work with all patients needing financial assistance to help determine their eligibility for this discount.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calver said that approach doesn’t address the balance billing or whether the charges were appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Aetna said “we are actively working to rectify the situation on behalf of the member.” But the health plan hasn’t shared any further details. The Austin school district declined to discuss this specific case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calver said the whole ordeal has been incredibly stressful for him and his wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am stuck in the middle of this convoluted, flawed system,” he said. “I’ve never owed a large amount like this or had credit card debt. What does it mean if this goes on my credit report?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_866064&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-866064&quot; src=&quot;https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/calver_hospital.jpg?w=1003&amp;amp;h=752&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1003&quot; height=&quot;752&quot; srcset=&quot;https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/calver_hospital.jpg 1003w, https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/calver_hospital.jpg?w=150&amp;amp;h=112 150w, https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/calver_hospital.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=375 500w, https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/calver_hospital.jpg?w=768&amp;amp;h=576 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1003px) 100vw, 1003px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Drew Calver’s daughters visit him at the hospital in April 2017 after his heart attack and resulting emergency surgery.&lt;span class=&quot;photo-credit&quot;&gt;(Courtesy of the Calver family)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Takeaway:&lt;/strong&gt; Faced with a surprise bill or a balance-billing situation, don’t rush to pay any medical bills you receive. First, let the insurance process play out completely so you’re sure what the health plan is paying the hospital and doctors — and what you ultimately might be responsible for, in terms of coinsurance or copayments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask for an itemized bill. Review the charges carefully and talk to your insurer, your employer and the hospital if the prices seem out of line. Arm yourself with estimates you can find online of the average prices charged in your area as you negotiate with all the players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the bills keep coming, talk to your employer’s benefits department or the state insurance department about your legal protections. The situation will vary depending on the type of health insurance you have and the state you live in. Tell any debt collection agencies that may contact you that you are contesting the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With any of these entities, you can always appeal to reason, with this argument: You had no choice but to go to an out-of-network hospital in the case of a life-threatening emergency, so the insurer and the hospital should work out payment and hold you harmless from financially crippling bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bill of the Month is a crowdsourced investigation by &lt;a href=&quot;https://khn.org/news/tag/bill-of-the-month/&quot;&gt;Kaiser Health News&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/02/16/585549568/share-your-medical-bill-with-us&quot;&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt; that dissects and explains medical bills.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;story-update&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UPDATE: Monday, shortly after publication and broadcast of this story by Kaiser Health News and NPR, St. David’s said it was now willing to accept $782.29 to resolve the $108,951 balance because Drew Calver qualifies for its “financial assistance discount.” In a statement, the hospital said this offer was contingent on Calver submitting his application for a discount based on his household finances. Calver disputed that he owes any additional money to St. David’s and said this situation should have been resolved long before now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>We are rewriting CodeMirror</title>
<link>https://codemirror.net/6/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://codemirror.net/6/</guid>
<description>
We are rewriting &lt;a href=&quot;https://codemirror.net&quot;&gt;CodeMirror&lt;/a&gt;, the open-source code editor for the browser. The new code will provide solid accessibility, touchscreen support, and a modern interface, while matching the existing code in features and performance. This work is currently in the prototype stage, and we're looking for financial support to complete it.
&lt;div class=&quot;progress&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;progress-amount&quot;&gt;5090&lt;/span&gt; € raised of 80000 € goal

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;donate&quot;&gt;Back the project&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://codemirror.net&quot;&gt;CodeMirror&lt;/a&gt;, as an open source project, has been going for over ten years. Since 2011, for versions 2 to 5, its architecture and programming interface have been more or less stable. In 2011 IE6 had a significant market share, Chrome was just getting started, and jQuery was considered the gold standard of interface design. It was a different time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While CodeMirror's architecture has held up pretty well, its age is starting to show. Issues related to touchscreen support, accessibility, and bidirectional text have been piling up in the bug tracker because, with the current architecture, they are extremely hard to address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, the JavaScript community's approach to modularity and taste in interfaces has matured a lot in this time. With another project—&lt;a href=&quot;https://prosemirror.net&quot;&gt;ProseMirror&lt;/a&gt;—we've seen how well a modular system and linear data flow architecture can work for an editor. From a current perspective, CodeMirror's current programming interface feels outdated and clunky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Next Generation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are happy to announce something we've been working on for the past months: a prototype for CodeMirror 6, a new architecture intending to address the current system's shortcomings from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This being at the &lt;em&gt;prototype&lt;/em&gt; stage, it's going to take a while more before it can be used in production. But it's already showing great promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;18.389880952381&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's accessible. Because browsers have come a long way, we can leave more to the browser, and don't have to &quot;fake&quot; the editing process by implementing it in JavaScript. This makes the editor much more transparent to screen readers and other accessibility tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works on your phone. Again, not having to fake things pays off. Instead of showing a bunch of DOM elements that look like a selection, you are now working with the native selection, so you can manipulate it in a touchscreen interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gets out of the way and leaves handling of complicated Unicode features such a bidirectional text to the browser, which tends to be better at this than we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It allows more ambitious extensions. The existing system, in which you registered callbacks to respond to editor events, quickly got messy when you needed to keep non-trivial state in sync with the document or selection. By moving to a more disciplined system based on transactions, we're making it easier to build extensions like collaborative editing or incremental code analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's modular. Improvements to the core editor's programming interface allow us to move many things that used to be in the core, such as syntax highlighting, into separate modules. There &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be an easy-to-use base module that gives you a complete editor, but if you want to, you can take that apart and build something very different from the pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is still fast, and can load large documents without significantly slowing down, by only drawing the visible content and painstakingly avoiding doing work that doesn't need to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0.89583333333333&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is written in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.typescriptlang.org/&quot;&gt;TypeScript&lt;/a&gt;, and exposes a well-considered, cleanly typed programming interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're curious about the details, we've written more about the new architecture in &lt;a href=&quot;https://codemirror.net/6/design.html&quot;&gt;the design document&lt;/a&gt;. The current code is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/codemirror/codemirror.next&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the good news. It does come with some bad news. Firstly, the programming interface for the editor is going to change radically, so when the time comes to upgrade, that might be quite a bit of work. We do have plans to write a compatibility wrapper which will allow &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt; setups to just drop that in, but it probably won't cover the whole old interface, and might turn out to be too slow if you're using the interface intensively. Additionally, the browser DOM structure of the editor will necessarily change, so you'll have to adjust your styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, we need money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Work Ahead&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our work so far has been generously funded by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://prototypefund.de/&quot;&gt;Prototype Fund&lt;/a&gt; program. That funding runs out next month. There's a lot to do still, and we are looking for corporate sponsors to help sustain our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your business relies on CodeMirror, or would be helped by having a solid, accessible, mobile-friendly code editor, please chip in and help us build this thing. We're looking to collect enough for another year of (part-time) work for a team of two, in the range of 80 000 euros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buttons on this page can be used for immediate low-friction credit card donations. If you have other needs, or want to arrange for a support contract as part of your backing, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://codemirror.net/6/marijn@haverbeke.nl&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;. Donations of 500 euros or more will be displayed on the project page—with a logo and a link—for at least two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;donate&quot;&gt;Back the project&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main areas of work that need to be addressed for this project to become a success are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;11.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finish and stabilize the core modules. Getting a design right requires experiments, much testing, outside feedback, and a lot of iterations. To avoid churn in the future, we want to invest in this before we declare the library to be stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Port the essential plugins that people want in a code editor. This includes things like autocompletion infrastructure, bracket matching and autoclosing, linter integration, code folding, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make it possible to run language highlighters written for CodeMirror 5 in the new editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design an improved system for language highlighters which makes it easier to write highlighters for new languages and avoids some of the design mistakes of the old system, such as the fact that it uses lines as the smallest unit of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write that compatibility wrapper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Document the system (more throughly than we are currently doing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handle the tall stack of bug reports that will no doubt come in once the community starts testing and deploying the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are two programmers from Berlin, &lt;a href=&quot;https://marijnhaverbeke.nl&quot;&gt;Marijn Haverbeke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://adrianheine.de/id&quot;&gt;Adrian Heine&lt;/a&gt;. Marijn originally wrote the library, and we've been collaborating on maintaining it, along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://prosemirror.net/&quot;&gt;ProseMirror&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/acornjs/acorn/&quot;&gt;Acorn&lt;/a&gt;, for the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Demo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The editor below shows off the current state of our work. It is the new editor core, with the old JavaScript highligher wired in and some plugins enabled, such as the undo history and a line number gutter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this is a first version, not a fully finished piece of software. If you find something that's broken, we're grateful for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/codemirror/codemirror.next/issues&quot;&gt;bug reports&lt;/a&gt;. For other feedback, please use &lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.codemirror.net/t/announcing-work-has-started-on-codemirror-6/1817&quot;&gt;this forum thread&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Sen. Wyden Confirms Cell-Site Simulators Disrupt Emergency Calls</title>
<link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/08/blog-post-wyden-911-disruption-css</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/08/blog-post-wyden-911-disruption-css</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sen. Ron Wyden &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/08/24/fbi-surveillance-devices-may-interfere-with-calls-us-senator-says/&quot;&gt;has sent a letter&lt;/a&gt; to the U.S. Department of Justice concerning disruptions to 911 emergency services caused by law enforcement’s use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://eff.org/document/eff-one-pager-cell-site-simulators&quot;&gt;cell-site simulators&lt;/a&gt; (CSS, also known as IMSI catchers or Stingrays). In the letter, Sen. Wyden states that:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Senior officials from the Harris Corporation—the manufacturer of the cell-site simulators used most frequently by U.S. law enforcement agencies—have confirmed to my office that Harris’ cell-site simulators completely disrupt the communications of targeted phones for as long as the surveillance is ongoing. According to Harris, targeted phones cannot make or receive calls, send or receive text messages, or send or receive any data over the Internet. Moreover, while the company claims its cell-site simulators include a feature that detects and permits the delivery of emergency calls to 9-1-1, its officials admitted to my office that this feature has not been independently tested as part of the Federal Communication Commission’s certification process, nor were they able to confirm this feature is capable of detecting and passing-through 9-1-1 emergency communications made by people who are deaf, hard of hearing, or speech disabled using Real-Time Text technology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The full text of the letter &lt;a href=&quot;https://eff.org/files/2018/08/27/wyden-stingray-jamming-letter-to-doj.pdf&quot;&gt;can be read here&lt;/a&gt; [PDF].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers of CSS technology have long suspected that using such technologies, even professionally designed and marketed CSS’s, would have a detrimental effect on emergency services, and now—for the first time—we have confirmation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is striking, but unfortunately not surprising, that law enforcement has been allowed to use these technologies and has continued to use them despite the significant and undisclosed risk to public safety posed by disabling 911 service, not to mention the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/node/89287&quot;&gt;myriad privacy concerns&lt;/a&gt; related to CSS use. What’s more, a cell-site simulator wouldn’t just disrupt service for the specific person or persons being tracked but would likely disrupt service for every mobile device in the area as it tricks every phone in the area into connecting to the fake base station in search of the target phone. This could be especially dangerous during a natural disaster when IMSI catchers are being used to locate missing persons in damaged buildings or other infrastructure, cutting off 911 service at a time like that could be a grave danger to others trapped in dangerous situations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Harris Corporation claims that they have the ability to detect and deliver calls to 911, but they admit that this feature hasn’t been tested. Put bluntly, there is no way for the public or policy makers to know if this technology works as intended.  Thanks to the onerous non-disclosure agreements that customers of Harris Corp and other CSS vendors’ customers have regularly been required to enter into there is very little public information about how CSS work and what their capabilities are. Even if a security researcher did audit a CSS, the results would be unlikely to ever see the light of day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Furthermore, even if Harris’ technology works the way they claim it does, they are far from the only manufacturer of CSS devices. There are several other companies that manufacture such technology and we know even less about the workings of their technologies or whether they have any protections against blocking 911 calls. Cell-site simulators are now easy to acquire or build, with homemade devices costing less than $1000 in parts. Criminals, spies, and anyone else with malicious intent could easily build a CSS specifically to disrupt phone service, or use it without caring whether it disrupts 911 service.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The only way to stop the public safety and public privacy threats that cell-site simulators pose is to increase the security of our mobile communications infrastructure at every layer. All companies involved in mobile communications from the network layer (AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon, etc.) to the hardware layer (Qualcomm, Samsung, Intel), to the software layer (Apple, Google) need to work together to ensure that our cellular infrastructure is safe, secure, and private from attacks by spys, criminals, and rogue law enforcement.  For their part, policymakers such as Sen. Wyden can help by continuing to provide transparency on how IMSI catchers work and are used, and funds to upgrade our aging cellular infrastructure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For more information about cell-site simulators please consult our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/pages/cell-site-simulatorsimsi-catchers&quot;&gt;Street-Level Surveillance guides&lt;/a&gt; on law enforcement surveillance technology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Sen. Wyden Confirms Cell-Site Simulators Disrupt Emergency Calls</og:title>
<og:url>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/08/blog-post-wyden-911-disruption-css</og:url>
<og:description>Sen. Ron Wyden has sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice concerning disruptions to 911 emergency services caused by law enforcement’s use of cell-site simulators (CSS, also known as IMSI catchers or Stingrays). In the letter, Sen. Wyden states that:Senior officials from the Harris...</og:description>

<title>Long-sought decay of Higgs boson observed at CERN</title>
<link>https://home.cern/about/updates/2018/08/long-sought-decay-higgs-boson-observed</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://home.cern/about/updates/2018/08/long-sought-decay-higgs-boson-observed</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Six years after its discovery, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://home.cern/topics/higgs-boson&quot;&gt;Higgs boson&lt;/a&gt; has at last been observed decaying to fundamental particles known as bottom quarks. The finding, presented today at CERN by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://home.cern/about/experiments/atlas&quot;&gt;ATLAS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://home.cern/about/experiments/cms&quot;&gt;CMS&lt;/a&gt; collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), is consistent with the hypothesis that the all-pervading quantum field behind the Higgs boson also gives mass to the bottom quark. Both teams have submitted their results for publication today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://home.cern/about/physics/standard-model&quot;&gt;Standard Model of particle physics&lt;/a&gt; predicts that about 60% of the time a Higgs boson will decay to a pair of bottom quarks, the second-heaviest of the six flavours of quarks. Testing this prediction is crucial because the result would either lend support to the Standard Model – which is built upon the idea that the Higgs field endows quarks and other fundamental particles with mass – or rock its foundations and point to new physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotting this common Higgs-boson decay channel is anything but easy, as the six-year period since the &lt;a href=&quot;https://press.cern/press-releases/2012/07/cern-experiments-observe-particle-consistent-long-sought-higgs-boson&quot;&gt;discovery of the boson&lt;/a&gt; has shown. The reason for the difficulty is that there are many other ways of producing bottom quarks in proton–proton collisions. This makes it hard to isolate the Higgs-boson decay signal from the background “noise” associated with such processes. By contrast, the less-common Higgs-boson decay channels that were observed at the time of discovery of the particle, such as the decay to a pair of photons, are much easier to extract from the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To extract the signal, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations each combined data from the first and second runs of the LHC, which involved collisions at energies of 7, 8 and 13 TeV. They then applied complex analysis methods to the data. The upshot, for both ATLAS and CMS, was the detection of the decay of the Higgs boson to a pair of bottom quarks with a significance that exceeds 5 standard deviations. Furthermore, both teams measured a rate for the decay that is consistent with the Standard Model prediction, within the current precision of the measurement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://home.cern/sites/home.web.cern.ch/files/image/inline-images/abelchio/zeeevent_aug21_v5.png&quot;/&gt;A CMS candidate event for the Higgs boson (H) decaying to two bottom quarks (b), in association with a Z boson decaying to an electron (e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) and an antielectron (e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). (Image: CMS/CERN)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;This observationis a milestone in the exploration of the Higgs boson. It shows that the ATLAS and CMS experiments have achieved deep understanding of their data and a control of backgrounds that surpasses expectations. ATLAS has now observed all couplings of the Higgs boson to the heavy quarks and leptons of the third generation as well as all major production modes,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;” &lt;/em&gt;said Karl Jakobs, spokesperson of the ATLAS collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Since the first single-experiment observation of the Higgs boson decay to tau-leptons one year ago, CMS, along with our colleagues in ATLAS, has observed the coupling of the Higgs boson to the heaviest fermions: the tau, the top quark, and now the bottom quark. The superb LHC performance and modern machine-learning techniques allowed us to achieve this result earlier than expected,” &lt;/em&gt;said Joel Butler, spokesperson of the CMS collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more data, the collaborations will improve the precision of these and other measurements and probe the decay of the Higgs boson into a pair of much-less-massive fermions called muons, always watching for deviations in the data that could point to physics beyond the Standard Model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The experiments continue to home in on the Higgs particle, which is often considered a portal to new physics. These beautiful and early achievements also underscore our plans for upgrading the LHC to substantially increase the statistics. The analysis methods have now been shown to reach the precision required for exploration of the full physics landscape, including hopefully new physics that so far hides so subtly,&lt;/em&gt;” said CERN Director for Research and Computing Eckhard Elsen.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why Static Websites Need HTTPS</title>
<link>https://www.troyhunt.com/heres-why-your-static-website-needs-https/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.troyhunt.com/heres-why-your-static-website-needs-https/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It was Jan last year that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/https-adoption-has-reached-the-tipping-point/&quot;&gt;I suggested HTTPS adoption had passed the &quot;tipping point&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, that is, it had passed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tipping_Point&quot;&gt;the moment of critical mass&lt;/a&gt; and as I said at the time, &quot;will very shortly become the norm&quot;. Since that time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/stats/&quot;&gt;the percentage of web pages loaded over a secure connection has rocketed from 52% to 71%&lt;/a&gt; whilst the proportion of the world's top 1 million websites redirecting people to HTTPS has gone &lt;a href=&quot;https://scotthelme.co.uk/alexa-top-1-million-analysis-feb-2017/&quot;&gt;from 20%&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://scotthelme.co.uk/alexa-top-1-million-analysis-february-2018/&quot;&gt;to about half&lt;/a&gt; (projected). The rapid adoption has been driven by a combination of ever more visible browser warnings (it was Chrome and Firefox's changes which prompted the aforementioned tipping point post), more easily accessible certificates via both Let's Encrypt and Cloudflare and a growing awareness of the risks that unencrypted traffic presents. Even the government has been pushing to drive adoption of HTTPS for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; sites, for example in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/serve-websites-over-https-always&quot;&gt;this post by the National Cyber Security Centre in the UK&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;all websites should use HTTPS, even if they don't include private content, sign-in pages, or credit card details&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there remains an undercurrent of dissent; &lt;a href=&quot;https://scotthelme.co.uk/https-anti-vaxxers/&quot;&gt;Scott Helme recently wrote about this and dispelled many of the myths people have for not securing their traffic&lt;/a&gt;. I shared some thoughts on what I suspect the real objection is in the tweet thread beginning with this one just a few days ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;6.6888888888889&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I'm forming a theory on those who are decrying the broad adoption of HTTPS: I suspect they're pushing back because they feel like they've lost control; they're being &quot;forced&quot; to move due to impending changes in Chrome in particular&lt;/p&gt;
— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1016077946291752960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;July 8, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of many robust internet debates (as is prone to happen on Twitter), the discussion turned to the value proposition of HTTPS on a static website. Is it needed? Does it do any good? What's it actually protecting? I'd been looking for an opportunity to put together some material on precisely this topic so when a discussion eventually led to just such an offer, it seemed like the perfect time to write this post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;7.5270935960591&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Actually, that’s perfect, I was looking for someone willing to have a static site they think is immune from transport layer risks used in a video on this. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1014736960542289922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;July 5, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just to be extra, extra sure this was Jacob's intention, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jacob_baytelman/status/1014735497447510017?s=11&quot;&gt;he did later extend the same offer to another party&lt;/a&gt; and also (quite rightly in my opinion) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jacob_baytelman/status/1014748927957065729?s=11&quot;&gt;observed that permission really isn't necessary to man in the middle your own traffic&lt;/a&gt;! So that's precisely what I've done - intercepted my own traffic passed over an insecure connection and put together a string of demos in a 24-minute video explaining why HTTPS is necessary on a static website. Here's the video and there's references and code samples for all the demos used immediately after that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_BNIkw4Ao9w&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;httpsiseasy&quot;&gt;HTTPS Is Easy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://httpsiseasy.com/&quot;&gt;HTTPS Is Easy video series&lt;/a&gt; is 4 short videos of about 5 minutes each that make it dead simple to serve almost any site over a secure connection. Not only is the video series awesome (IMHO), the awesome community of people who've watched this have translated closed captions into 16 different languages already making HTTPS more accessible to more people than ever!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;wifipineapple&quot;&gt;WiFi Pineapple&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wifipineapple.com/&quot;&gt;The Wifi Pineapple&lt;/a&gt; is a super-easy little device made by Hak5 that's not only easy stand up as a wireless hotspot, but can trick devices into thinking it's a known network that they automatically connect to without any user interaction whatsoever. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/tag/wifi-pineapple/&quot;&gt;I've done a heap of writing on this little device&lt;/a&gt; and regularly use it at conferences and training events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;clippyjs&quot;&gt;ClippyJS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody loves a bit of Clippy, just so long as it's in jest! I did this demo with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smore.com/clippy-js&quot;&gt;ClippyJS&lt;/a&gt; and if you really want to relive the memories of days gone by, you can also embed Merlin, Rover and Links then orchestrate their behaviour via a set of actions invoked in the JS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cornify&quot;&gt;Cornify&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who doesn't love unicorns, right?! &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cornify.com/&quot;&gt;Cornify&lt;/a&gt; will help you liven up those otherwise dull pages with magical beasts and rainbows. Comes complete with Cornify buttons to add to your website (or someone else's).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;harlemshake&quot;&gt;Harlem Shake&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's actually a bit more to this than just entertainment value, the Harlem Shake has regularly been used as a &quot;proof&quot; for running script on a vulnerable site. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLDCI0PVbsg&quot;&gt;check out how it's used when embedded in the TXT record of a DNS entry which is then loaded into a WHOIS service which doesn't properly output encode the results&lt;/a&gt;. There's also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0noqLisW_c&quot;&gt;Brenno de Winter's excellent example of XSS flaws in Dutch banks&lt;/a&gt;, again, demonstrated via a lot of shaking. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pastebin.com/aJna4paJ&quot;&gt;Grab the entire script&lt;/a&gt; and then inject as required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cryptominer&quot;&gt;Cryptominer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://coinhive.com/&quot;&gt;Coinhive&lt;/a&gt; which offers to &quot;Monetise Your Business With Your Users' CPU Power&quot;. Frankly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://scotthelme.co.uk/coinhive-need-to-tidy-up-their-act/&quot;&gt;it's a pretty shady service&lt;/a&gt; regularly abused for malicious purposes but that was precisely what was required in this situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;routercsrfexploit&quot;&gt;Router CSRF Exploit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-12529/&quot;&gt;CVE-2018-12529&lt;/a&gt; and the sample exploit was taken from &lt;a href=&quot;https://securitywarrior9.blogspot.com/2018/06/cross-site-request-forgery-intex-router.html&quot;&gt;the SecurityResearch101 blog&lt;/a&gt;. We've often seen CSRF attacks against routers result in DNS hijacking which, of course, is yet another risk that HTTPS protects against. We've known about this for years, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/10/01/hacked-routers-brazil-vb2012/&quot;&gt;how the proceeds of this crime have been used to pay for Brazilian prostitutes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dnshijacking&quot;&gt;DNS Hijacking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was done with just a few lines of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telerik.com/blogs/understanding-fiddlerscript&quot;&gt;FiddlerScript&lt;/a&gt; in the OnBeforeRequest event:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;if (oSession.HostnameIs(&quot;btlr.com&quot;)){
  oSession.hostname = &quot;scripting.com&quot;;  
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were you using a device such as the Wifi Pineapple you can could achieve the same result using &lt;a href=&quot;https://scotthelme.co.uk/wifi-pineapple-karma-dnsspoof/&quot;&gt;DNSspoof&lt;/a&gt;. The outcome is identical - traffic going to one insecure address results in traffic from a totally different address being returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;chinasgreatcannon&quot;&gt;China's Great Cannon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was &lt;a href=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/2015/04/chinas-great-cannon/&quot;&gt;the attack back in 2015 that sought to take down GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, or at least the repository &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.greatfire.org/&quot;&gt;greatfire.org&lt;/a&gt; maintains there. I showed the de-obfuscated version in the video &lt;a href=&quot;https://pastebin.com/embed_js/NM7ij09e&quot;&gt;which you can find on Pastebin&lt;/a&gt;. The original version and a more detailed technical writeup on the incident can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&amp;amp;month=2015-03&amp;amp;post=China%27s-Man-on-the-Side-Attack-on-GitHub&quot;&gt;this piece from Netresec&lt;/a&gt;. Incidentally, Baidu &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; doesn't serve their homepage over HTTPS by default (although the can serve a valid cert if explicitly requested over HTTPS) which gives the service the unenviable title of being the world's largest website not to do so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alexa.com/topsites&quot;&gt;according to Alexa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;beef&quot;&gt;BeEF&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, to me, was the most impactful demo not just because it resulted in pushing malware and phishing attacks to the target website, but because it shows just how much control an attacker can take over the browsing experience of victims on that site. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://beefproject.com/&quot;&gt;the BeEF project website&lt;/a&gt; for more background on that and if you want to implement the demo I ran, &lt;a href=&quot;https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/kali-linux.kali-linux?tab=Overview&quot;&gt;go and grab Kali Linux from VMDepot&lt;/a&gt; (now rolled into the Azure Marketplace) and deploy it directly into an Azure VM (I used the smallest size and it worked fine). I allowed inbound requests on port 80 as well as port 22 so I could SSH in. I then changed the port from 3000 to 80 in the config.yaml file (refer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/beefproject/beef/wiki/Configuration&quot;&gt;the BeEF config documentation&lt;/a&gt;), included a script file from [vm ip]/hook.js in the victim site an browsed over to [vm ip]/ui/panel and logged in with &quot;beef&quot; and &quot;beef&quot;. That's it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;rickroll&quot;&gt;Rick Roll&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one needs no introduction, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&quot;&gt;going on half a &lt;em&gt;billion&lt;/em&gt; views on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, it's the surprise gift that keeps on giving!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>EU wants to require platforms to filter uploaded content, including code</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.github.com/2018-03-14-eu-proposal-upload-filters-code/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;language-console highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;10.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; git push 
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (2/2), completed with 2 local objects.

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt; ! [remote rejected] patch-1 -&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; patch-1 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;push declined due to article 13 filters&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU is considering a copyright proposal that &lt;a href=&quot;https://savecodeshare.eu/&quot;&gt;would require code-sharing platforms&lt;/a&gt; to monitor all content that users upload for potential copyright infringement (see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/proposal-directive-european-parliament-and-council-copyright-digital-single-market&quot;&gt;EU Commission’s proposed Article 13 of the Copyright Directive&lt;/a&gt;). The proposal is aimed at music and videos on streaming platforms, based on a theory of a “value gap” between the profits those platforms make from uploaded works and what copyright holders of some uploaded works receive. However, the way it’s written captures many other types of content, including code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d like to make sure developers in the EU who understand that automated filtering of code would make software less reliable and more expensive—and can explain this to EU policymakers—participate in the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-you-should-care-about-upload-filters&quot;&gt;Why you should care about upload filters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upload filters (“&lt;a href=&quot;https://re-publica.com/en/session/stop-censorship-machines-how-can-we-prevent-mandatory-upload-filters-eu&quot;&gt;censorship machines&lt;/a&gt;”) are one of the most controversial elements of the copyright proposal, raising a number of concerns, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy&lt;/strong&gt;: Upload filters are a form of surveillance, effectively a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/02/eu-court-justice-social-networks&quot;&gt;“general monitoring obligation”&lt;/a&gt; prohibited by EU law&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free speech&lt;/strong&gt;: Requiring platforms to monitor content contradicts &lt;a href=&quot;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0031:en:HTML&quot;&gt;intermediary liability protections&lt;/a&gt; in EU law and creates incentives to remove content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ineffectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/571681753c44d835a440c8b5/t/58d058712994ca536bbfa47a/1490049138881/FilteringPaperWebsite.pdf&quot;&gt;Content detection tools are flawed&lt;/a&gt; (generate false positives, don’t fit all kinds of content) and overly burdensome, especially for small and medium-sized businesses that might not be able to afford them or the resulting litigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upload filters are especially concerning for software developers given that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Software developers create copyrightable works—their code—and those who choose an open source license want to allow that code to be shared&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;False positives (and negatives) are especially likely for software code because code often has many contributors and layers, often with different licensing for different components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requiring code-hosting platforms to scan and automatically remove content could drastically impact software developers when their dependencies are removed due to false positives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU Parliament continues to introduce new proposals for Article 13 but these issues remain. &lt;a href=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/2018/02/voss-upload-filters/&quot;&gt;MEP Julia Reda explains further&lt;/a&gt; in a recent proposal from Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;eu-policymakers-want-and-need-to-hear-from-developers&quot;&gt;EU policymakers want and need to hear from developers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of our ongoing collaboration with others affected, GitHub will help represent developers at an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.communia-association.org/2018/03/06/join-us-european-copyright-action-days-19-21-march-brussels/&quot;&gt;upcoming breakfast in Parliament&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, March 20, intended to show the human impact of this copyright proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU policymakers have told us it would be very useful to hear directly from more developers. In particular, developers at European companies can make a significant impact.&lt;/p&gt;

Please explain how important the ability to freely share code is for software developers and how important open source software is to the software industry and the EU economy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;ulink&quot; href=&quot;http://git-scm.com/&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; is a version control Swiss army knife. A reliable versatile multipurpose revision control tool whose extraordinary flexibility makes it tricky to learn, let alone master.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Arthur C. Clarke observed, any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. This is a great way to approach Git: newbies can ignore its inner workings and view Git as a gizmo that can amaze friends and infuriate enemies with its wondrous abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than go into details, we provide rough instructions for particular effects. After repeated use, gradually you will understand how each trick works, and how to tailor the recipes for your needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;48&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m humbled that so many people have worked on translations of these pages. I greatly appreciate having a wider audience because of the efforts of those named above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dustin Sallings, Alberto Bertogli, James Cameron, Douglas Livingstone, Michael Budde, Richard Albury, Tarmigan, Derek Mahar, Frode Aannevik, Keith Rarick, Andy Somerville, Ralf Recker, Øyvind A.

&lt;p&gt;François Marier maintains the Debian package originally created by Daniel Baumann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My gratitude goes to many others for your support and praise. I’m tempted to quote you here, but it might raise expectations to ridiculous heights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I’ve left you out by mistake, please tell me or just send me a patch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's no secret that &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/category/siri/&quot;&gt;Siri&lt;/a&gt; is way behind other voice assistants like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/category/google-assistant/&quot;&gt;Google Assistant&lt;/a&gt; and Amazon's &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/category/alexa/&quot;&gt;Alexa&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to comprehension and total number of skills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has drastically improved Siri over the years, adding new features and upgrading its voice to sound more human-like, but its ongoing shortcomings really revealed themselves in the recent launch of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/2018/02/12/apple-homepod-review/&quot;&gt;HomePod&lt;/a&gt;, the company's first product that's almost entirely controlled by the voice assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how did Apple screw up Siri so badly when it was released so far in advance of the competition? A new report from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-seven-year-itch-how-apples-marriage-to-siri-turned-sour?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJyYXltb25kQG1hc2hhYmxlLmNvbSIsImV4cCI6MTU1MjYxMTc3NSwibiI6Ikd1ZXN0Iiwic2NvcGUiOlsic2hhcmUiXX0.CHDSvD11CgG9W1yeOeG0zuHSdng2B4BgOCUyFNuV06w&amp;amp;unlock=c55324f945d95741&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Information&lt;/a&gt; reveals how years of missteps left Siri eating dust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the report, after acquiring the original Siri app in 2010 for $200 million, Apple proceeded to quickly integrate the digital assistant into the iPhone 4S in 2011. There was so much potential for Siri, and Apple promised to bring voice controls to the masses just as it did multi-touch on the original iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except the voice-controlled computing revolution never quite happened the way Apple predicted. iPhones users quickly realized that Siri couldn't do a lot of things. And even after Apple opened Siri up with SiriKit in 2016, it still isn't as intelligent as the Google Assistant or Alexa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what the heck happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According The Information, it all went downhill after Steve Jobs died in 2011. Jobs' death marked the beginning of Siri's downfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of continuously updating Siri so that it would get smarter faster, Richard Williamson, one of the former iOS chief Scott Forstall's deputies, reportedly only wanted to update the assistant annually to coincide with new iOS releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull-quotes&quot; data-fragment=&quot;frustrated-by-all-the&quot; data-description=&quot;Frustrated by all the patching they were doing to Siri, engineers reportedly batted around the idea of starting over.&quot; data-micro=&quot;1&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frustrated by all the patching they were doing to Siri, engineers reportedly batted around the idea of starting over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, of course, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; how a digital assistant should be treated. As Google and Amazon have demonstrated, digital assistants need to constantly be updated in the background in order to keep up with the ever-changing demands of its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Williamson denies the accusations that he slowed Siri development down and instead cast blame on Siri's creators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was slow, when it worked at all,&quot; Williamson said. &quot;The software was riddled with serious bugs. Those problems lie entirely with the original Siri team, certainly not me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other problems over the years included layering new elements on top of Siri using technologies culled from new acquisitions. For example, the Siri team had issues integrating new search features from Apple's acquisition of Topsy in 2013 and natural language features from the VocalIQ acquisition in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Members of the Topsy team expressed a reluctance to work with a Siri team they viewed as slow and bogged down by the initial infrastructure that had been patched up but never completely replaced since it launched.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frustrated by all the patching they were doing to Siri, engineers reportedly considered starting over from scratch. Instead of building on top of Siri's reportedly bad infrastructure, they would rebuild Siri from the ground up — correctly on the second time around. Of course, when you're serving hundreds of millions of users across all of Apple's devices, that's a tall task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most revealing part of the report exposes how Apple didn't even have plans to integrate Siri into HomePod until &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the Amazon Echo launched:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sign of how unprepared Apple was to deal with a rivalry, two Siri team members told The Information that their team didn’t even learn about Apple’s HomePod project until 2015—after Amazon unveiled the Echo in late 2014. One of Apple’s original plans was to launch its speaker without Siri included, according to a source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, it looks like Siri won't be blown up and a rebuilt. And if Apple wants to transform its assistant into a true competitor to the Google Assistant and Alexa, it'll need to sort out its internal management issues and decide what it really wants Siri to be. For all users, we hope it's more intelligence and deeper integration with third-party apps and services.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>False memories, or why we’re so sure of things we’re wrong about</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt;Felipe De Brigard is an assistant professor of philosophy at Duke, where he runs the Imagination and Modal Cognition Lab. That may not sound like philosophy in the traditional sense; De Brigard’s work is at the intersection of philosophy and neuroscience, and is supported right now by a $500,000 grant from the Office of Naval Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Felipe De Brigard&quot; class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;https://today.duke.edu/sites/default/files/styles/story_body/public/debrigard.jpg?itok=P0ENwfcY&quot; title=&quot;Felipe De Brigard&quot;/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Professor De Brigard: You explore how the imagination and memory interact. How did you become interested in this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt;I’ve been interested in memory for as long as I can remember. In college, I studied neuropsychology in addition to philosophy, and interacted with patients suffering from memory deficits. One such deficit, known as confabulation, involved patients coming up with fantastic stories about absurd scenarios as if they were autobiographical memories. What intrigued me about this phenomenon is not what these patients got wrong -- which was a lot -- but rather what they got right. Despite being false, there was an air of plausibility to their confabulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are you working on now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt;My main interest is memory, and in particular the fact that we have false memories. We think we’re so sure that we remember something that happened – but it didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt;In trying to understand how we generate these false memories, I was struck by this model in which memory reconstructs a scene. You have pieces and gaps, and those gaps are filled with something like the most likely way in which they could be filled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mean, what you want to be true?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt;Not necessarily. You almost never have control over the process of filling up or reconstructing your memories. Unbeknownst to you, the process operates probabilistically. Given your past experiences and knowledge, your memory system gives you the most likely thing that could have happened to help you fill any gaps at the time of retrieval. Most of the time the final product coincides with what actually happened, so it is true. But sometimes it does not, in which case we talk about false memories. I think most of our memories are reconstructed in this way, and many of them are false, we just don’t notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt;All of this made me think that when we imagine things, we also imagine how things could have occurred in the past. Say you were crossing the street and almost got hit by a car. You can’t help but imagine what would have happened if you did get hit by the car. We just slip into that kind of imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt;Those two things are closely linked – the counter-factual ‘what-if’ imagination, and the way memory recollects things. My lab works a lot on that connection, between memory retrieval and imagining hypothetical scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PFIJ1lNGaK8&quot; width=&quot;800&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt;The (Navy) grant has to do with causation. People make judgments about causes all the time. Sometimes, what we think is the cause of something is the failure of something to act. If I ask you to water my plants over the weekend while I’m on vacation, and then you forget and my plants die, I’d say your failing to water my plants caused them to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt;Those sorts of causal judgments are really weird because the absence of an event is what causes something to happen. Something didn’t happen, and as a result, there was an effect. That’s called an omissive causation, because something was omitted. Trying to understand that is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt;My graduate student Paul Henne and I are interested in understanding how people make judgments about omissions. The nonexistence of an event led to the plants dying. I blame you; why don’t I blame something else? The President of the United States didn’t water my plants, but I’m not blaming him. So why do I choose you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, but in this case, I agreed to water your plants.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt;That’s right. We had an agreement. We both know that you were supposed to water the plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt;But in a lot of cases, there isn’t a clear agreement. The grant I’m working on explores how people decide what the cause is where the options are less clear. Our suggestion is that this process is dependent on how people generate counter-factual thoughts, and we want to understand how that psychological process works. Ultimately, we want to understand the psychological mechanisms underlying these kinds of cognitive processes to generate models that can contribute to computer programs and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is artificial intelligence?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt;There is a very uncontroversial way of defining it: AI is a discipline of computer science that seeks to generate computer programs and algorithms to solve complex problems for which we thought human intelligence was required. Period. Some people, I think without much reason, think of AI as a discipline that seeks to manufacture minds and conscious entities. This may or may not happen, but such an outcome is neither its objective nor the best way to define it, in my opinion. It is like saying that medical science is the discipline that seeks to make us immortal. This may or may not happen, but in reality what medical science aims is to prevent us from dying of diseases, accidents, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you do this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt;In our lab, we do a lot of behavioral and neuroimaging experiments using magnetic resonance imaging. We scan people’s brains while they’re doing a task – like thinking about events that could have occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You create scenarios for people to think about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt;Yes, sometimes. In one, I ask people to imagine better and worse outcomes of events. We measure the brain activity to see if we can find patterns and see what parts of the brain are more active or more important for certain tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It sounds like work than can help you fundamentally understand a bit better just how we think.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text&quot;&gt;Yes, that’s true. We specifically are working on how people imagine, and how memory both constrains and guides our imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Key Git Concepts Explained the Hard Way</title>
<link>https://zwischenzugs.com/2018/03/14/five-key-git-concepts-explained-the-hard-way/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://zwischenzugs.com/2018/03/14/five-key-git-concepts-explained-the-hard-way/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever read a git man page, you’ll know that trying to understand git can be an intimidating experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s even a &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net/&quot;&gt;git man page generator&lt;/a&gt; that produces joke git pages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;If &amp;lt;upstream&amp;gt; is not specified, the upstream configured in
branch.&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;.remote and branch.&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;.merge options will be used 
(see &lt;strong&gt;git-config&lt;/strong&gt;(1) for details) and the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--fork-point&lt;/strong&gt; option is 
assumed. If you are currently not on any branch or if the current
branch does not have a configured upstream, the rebase will abort.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git-land-remote&lt;/code&gt; lands some applied remotes over the packed applied
branches, and it is in various cases a possibility that a
filter-branched error must prevent staged cleaning of some named
stages.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the above extracts is a joke, one is real…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here’s five core git concepts explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully after reading this the man pages will start to make more sense. If you’re confused by one I’ve missed, contact me to write it up for you (@ianmiell or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-miell-694496/&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post uses the ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://learncodethehardway.org/&quot;&gt;hard way&lt;/a&gt;‘ method to teach the concepts by having you type out the commands and think through what’s going on, without having to worry about breaking anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I use the same method to teach git in my book &lt;a href=&quot;https://leanpub.com/learngitthehardway&quot;&gt;Learn Git the Hard Way&lt;/a&gt;.    &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;https://leanpub.com/learngitthehardway&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-4278&quot; src=&quot;https://zwischenzugs.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/learngitthehardway.png?w=94&amp;amp;h=150&quot; alt=&quot;learngitthehardway&quot; width=&quot;94&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; srcset=&quot;https://zwischenzugs.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/learngitthehardway.png?w=94&amp;amp;h=150 94w, https://zwischenzugs.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/learngitthehardway.png?w=188&amp;amp;h=300 188w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 94px) 100vw, 94px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1) Reference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many will know this already, but I need to make sure you know it because it’s so fundamental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ‘reference’ is a string that points to a commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four main types of reference: &lt;strong&gt;HEAD, Tag, Branch, and Remote Reference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;HEAD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HEAD is a special reference that &lt;strong&gt;always points to where the git repository is&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you checked out a branch, it’s pointed to the last commit in that branch. If you checked out a specific commit, it’s pointed to that commit. If you check out at a tag, it’s pointed to the commit of that tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time you commit, the HEAD reference/pointer is moved from the old to the new commit. This happens automatically, but it’s all going on under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A tag is a reference that points to a specific commit.&lt;/strong&gt; Whatever else happens (and unlike the HEAD), that tag will stay pointed at the commit it was originally pointed at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Branch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A branch is &lt;strong&gt;like a tag, but will move when the HEAD moves.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can only be on one branch at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type out&lt;/strong&gt; these commands and explain what’s going on. Take your time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$ mkdir lgthw_origin
$ cd lgthw_origin
$ git init
$ echo 1 &amp;gt; afile
$ git add afile
$ git commit -m firstcommit
$ git log --oneline --decorate --all --graph
$ git branch otherbranch
$ git tag firstcommittag
$ git log --oneline --decorate --all --graph
$ echo 2 &amp;gt;&amp;gt; afile
$ git commit -am secondcommit
$ git checkout otherbranch
$ git log --oneline --decorate --all --graph
$ echo 3 &amp;gt;&amp;gt; afile
$ git commit -am thirdcommit
$ git log --oneline --decorate --all --graph&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now do it again and explain to someone else what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Remote Reference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A remote reference is a reference to code that’s from another repository. See below for more on that…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2)  ‘Detached Head’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you know what HEAD is, then understanding what a ‘detached head’ is will be &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ‘detached head’ is a git repository that’s checked out but has no branch associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing from the above listing, type this in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$ git checkout firstcommittag&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get that scary message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Note: checking out 'firstcommit'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

git checkout -b &amp;lt;new-branch-name&amp;gt;

HEAD is now at 1b1499c... firstcommit
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but if you follow the instructions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;$ git log --oneline --decorate --all --graph
$ git checkout -b firstcommitbranch
$ git log --oneline --decorate --all --graph
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you can figure out what’s going on. There was a tag, but no branch at that commit, so the &lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt; was detached from a branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3) Remote Reference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A remote reference is a reference to a commit on &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; git repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$ cd ..
$ git clone lgthw_origin lgthw_cloned
$ cd lgthw_cloned
$ git remote -v
$ git log --oneline --decorate --all --graph&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The log graph looks different doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare that to the ​&lt;code&gt;git log&lt;/code&gt; output in the other folder and think about how they differ. What word do you see multiple times in the output that you didn’t see before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cloned repo has its own copy of the branch (&lt;code&gt;firstcommitbranch&lt;/code&gt;) and tag (&lt;code&gt;firstcommit&lt;/code&gt;) because that’s where the repository’s &lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt; was when you cloned it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$ git branch -a&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shows all the branches visible in this repository, both local and remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare that to the output of the same command in the original folder. How does it differ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now check out your local master:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$ git checkout master&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and you get a message saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Switched to a new branch 'master'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you’ve got a local reference &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; which ‘tracks’ the master in the remote repository. The local reference is &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;, and the remote reference is &lt;code&gt;origin/master&lt;/code&gt;. Git assumed you meant your local master to track the remote master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two branches look the same, but they are linked only by the configuration of this repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$ cd ../lgthw_origin
$ git checkout master
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$ echo origin_change &amp;gt;&amp;gt; afile
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$ git commit -am 'Change on the origin'&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then go back to the cloned repository and fetch the changes from the origin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$ cd ../lgthw_cloned&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$ git fetch origin&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$ &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;git log --oneline --decorate --all --graph&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you see what happened to your local master branch, and what happened to the origin’s? Why are they now separate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that you didn’t&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt; the change. &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt; does a fetch &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a merge, and we don’t want to confuse here by skipping steps and making it look like magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt; is best avoided when you are learning git…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you like this post, you’ll like my book &lt;a href=&quot;https://leanpub.com/learngitthehardway&quot;&gt;Learn Git the Hard Way&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It covers all this and much more in a similar style.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://leanpub.com/learngitthehardway&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; size-medium wp-image-4278 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://zwischenzugs.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/learngitthehardway.png?w=188&amp;amp;h=300&quot; alt=&quot;learngitthehardway&quot; width=&quot;188&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; srcset=&quot;https://zwischenzugs.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/learngitthehardway.png?w=188&amp;amp;h=300 188w, https://zwischenzugs.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/learngitthehardway.png?w=376&amp;amp;h=600 376w, https://zwischenzugs.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/learngitthehardway.png?w=94&amp;amp;h=150 94w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 188px) 100vw, 188px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4) Fast Forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your git log graph should have looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;* 90694b9 (origin/master) Change on the origin&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;* d20fc9a (HEAD -&amp;gt; master) secondcommit&lt;/strong&gt;
| * 2e7ae21 (origin/otherbranch) thirdcommit
|/ 
* 6c14f2f (tag: firstcommittag, origin/firstcommitbranch, origin/HEAD, firstcommitbranch) firstcommit
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Your ids may differ from the above – otherwise it should be the same.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, do you see how the &lt;code&gt;Change on the origin&lt;/code&gt; commit is not branched from your local &lt;code&gt;HEAD/master&lt;/code&gt; commit &lt;code&gt;secondcommit&lt;/code&gt; – it’s in a ‘straight line’ from the &lt;code&gt;firstcommit&lt;/code&gt; tag?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that if you ‘merge’ &lt;code&gt;origin/master&lt;/code&gt; into your local master, git can figure out that all it needs to do is move the &lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; reference to where the &lt;code&gt;origin/master&lt;/code&gt; branch is and its ‘merge’ job is done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$ git merge origin/master
$ git log --oneline --decorate --all --graph&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all a ‘fast forward’ is: git saw that there’s no need to do any merging, it can just ‘fast forward’ the references to the point you are merging to. Or if you prefer, it just moves the pointers along rather than create a new merge commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We just did a &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt;, by the way. A &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt; consists of a &lt;code&gt;git fetch&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;git merge&lt;/code&gt;. Breaking it down into these two steps helps reduce the mystery of why things can go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As an exercise, after finishing this article do the whole exercise again, but make a change to both origin/master and master and then do the fetch and merge to see what happens when a fast-forward is not possible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5) Rebase&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;origin/master&lt;/code&gt; are now in sync, so now run these commands to see what a rebase is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$ cd ../lgthw_origin 
&lt;/strong&gt;$ git status
&lt;strong&gt;$ echo origin_change_rebase &amp;gt;&amp;gt; afile &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$ git commit -am 'origin change rebase' &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$ git log --oneline --decorate --all --graph &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK so far? You’ve made a change on master on the origin repo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$ cd ../lgthw_cloned &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$ echo cloned_change_rebase &amp;gt;&amp;gt; anewfile &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$ git add anewfile &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$ git commit -m 'cloned change rebase in anewfile' &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$ git log --oneline --decorate --all --graph &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$ git fetch origin &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$ git log --oneline --decorate --all --graph &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$ git rebase origin/master &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$ git log --oneline --decorate --all --graph&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you see what’s happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If not, have a close look at the last two &lt;code&gt;git log&lt;/code&gt; outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what a rebase is – it takes a set of commits and moves (or ‘re-bases’) them to another commit.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Theranos, CEO Holmes, and Former President Balwani Charged with Fraud</title>
<link>https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-41</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-41</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Silicon Valley-based private company Theranos Inc., its founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes, and its former President Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani with raising more than $700 million from investors through an elaborate, years-long fraud in which they exaggerated or made false statements about the company’s technology, business, and financial performance.  Theranos and Holmes have agreed to resolve the charges against them.  Importantly, in addition to a penalty, Holmes has agreed to give up majority voting control over the company, as well as to a reduction of her equity which, combined with shares she previously returned, materially reduces her equity stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaints allege that Theranos, Holmes, and Balwani made numerous false and misleading statements in investor presentations, product demonstrations, and media articles by which they deceived investors into believing that its key product – a portable blood analyzer – could conduct comprehensive blood tests from finger drops of blood, revolutionizing the blood testing industry.  In truth, according to the SEC’s complaint, Theranos’ proprietary analyzer could complete only a small number of tests, and the company conducted the vast majority of patient tests on modified and industry-standard commercial analyzers manufactured by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaints further charge that Theranos, Holmes, and Balwani claimed that Theranos’ products were deployed by the U.S. Department of Defense on the battlefield in Afghanistan and on medevac helicopters and that the company would generate more than $100 million in revenue in 2014.  In truth, Theranos’ technology was never deployed by the U.S. Department of Defense and generated a little more than $100,000 in revenue from operations in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investors are entitled to nothing less than complete truth and candor from companies and their executives,” said Steven Peikin, Co-Director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division.  “The charges against Theranos, Holmes, and Balwani make clear that there is no exemption from the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws simply because a company is non-public, development-stage, or the subject of exuberant media attention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a result of Holmes’ alleged fraudulent conduct, she is being stripped of control of the company she founded, is returning millions of shares to Theranos, and is barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for 10 years,” said Stephanie Avakian, Co-Director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division.  “This package of remedies exemplifies our efforts to impose tailored and meaningful sanctions that directly address the unlawful behavior charged and best remedies the harm done to shareholders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Theranos story is an important lesson for Silicon Valley,” said Jina Choi, Director of the SEC’s San Francisco Regional Office.  “Innovators who seek to revolutionize and disrupt an industry must tell investors the truth about what their technology can do today, not just what they hope it might do someday.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theranos and Holmes have agreed to settle the fraud charges levied against them.  Holmes agreed to pay a $500,000 penalty, be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for 10 years, return the remaining 18.9 million shares that she obtained during the fraud, and relinquish her voting control of Theranos by converting her super-majority Theranos Class B Common shares to Class A Common shares.  Due to the company’s liquidation preference, if Theranos is acquired or is otherwise liquidated, Holmes would not profit from her ownership until – assuming redemption of certain warrants – over $750 million is returned to defrauded investors and other preferred shareholders.  The settlements with Theranos and Holmes are subject to court approval.  Theranos and Holmes neither admitted nor denied the allegations in the SEC’s complaint.  The SEC will litigate its claims against Balwani in federal district court in the Northern District of California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Jessica Chan, Rahul Kolhatkar, and Michael Foley and supervised by Monique Winkler and Erin Schneider in the San Francisco Regional Office.  The SEC’s litigation will be led by Jason Habermeyer and Marc Katz of the San Francisco office.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Suing Equifax in Small Claims Court</title>
<link>https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/people-are-suing-equifax-in-small-claims-court-its-totally-brilliant-heres-why.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/people-are-suing-equifax-in-small-claims-court-its-totally-brilliant-heres-why.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Last September, Christian Haigh learned he was one of the 143 million people in the U.S. whose information was hacked in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/white-house-says-after-equifax-lets-get-rid-of-social-security-numbers.html&quot;&gt;Equifax breach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might recall, Equifax issued an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/17-worst-apologies-of-2017-ranked-in-increasing-order-of-utter-despicableness-and-worst-one-isnt-even-what-you-thought.html&quot;&gt;apology that was almost laughable&lt;/a&gt;. Lawyers started class-action lawsuits. But Haigh, who is a co-founder and CTO of litigation finance startup &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.legalist.com&quot;&gt;Legalist&lt;/a&gt;, had a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He filed suit against the credit reporting giant in small-claims court in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a brilliant idea. I imagine it's unlikely Equifax thought it would be dealing with individual plaintiffs, suing for fairly small dollar amounts, in very informal courtrooms across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I have to &quot;imagine&quot; this, to be clear, because I haven't heard back after emailing the three top U.S. media contacts listed on Equifax's website asking for any comment on this story.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Haigh won an $8,000 judgment against the credit reporting giant--later reduced to $5,500 on appeal. In the process, his company started funding other people's small claims suits against Equifax, too. (Legalist pays lawyers in plaintiff's suits on an hourly basis, and takes a contingency fee if the case is successful.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I interviewed Haigh and his co-founder, CEO Eva Shang, after reading two blog posts in which Haigh described his experience (&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.legalist.com/i-won-8-000-from-equifax-in-small-claims-court-heres-how-you-can-too-f0ce6925c079&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.legalist.com/i-fought-equifaxs-lawyer-in-court-and-won-here-s-how-a16930c53af3&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). The two co-founders, both in their early 20s, were friends at Harvard who left before graduating for Y Combinator, and who raised a $10 million investment round last summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;I think the theme our company really&lt;/span&gt; believes &lt;span&gt;in is that the justice system should be &lt;/span&gt;reoriented &lt;span&gt;to help the underd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;og,&quot; Shang said. &quot;A lot of people... believe it's so &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;stacked in&lt;/span&gt; favor &lt;span&gt;of peopl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;e who&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;have money&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;and power.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I learned more about Haigh's case and the company, I kept seeing certain principles emerge--principles I think can help &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/3-things-people-get-wrong-about-david-vs-goliath.html&quot;&gt;David beat Goliath&lt;/a&gt; in almost any situation. Here's the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fortune favors the bold.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the timeline: The breach happened in July; Equifax disclosed it on September 7. Haigh filed suit on September 19. That's rocket-speed in litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, many lawyers seem to wait until the last day before the statute of limitations expires on a claim before filing. Not Haigh, and none of this would have worked out for him if he hadn't raced to the courthouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Since we heard about [the Equifax breach] and&lt;/span&gt; realized I'd been impacted, I wanted to do something about it,&quot; Haigh told me. &quot;And if I didn't do something then, I would have never done it. I would have waited until the class actions and forgotten. I wanted to do something.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Choose your battlefield.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your data was breached, you may choose not to fight, but that only means that you've conceded easily. If you are going to fight, it's best if you can be the one to choose where the fight takes place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, that meant small-claims court. Doing battle with Equifax there resulted in a &quot;much more relaxed situation,&quot; Haigh said. As we'll see, it worked to his advantage. Contrast that to the many who simply logged into Equifax's website for a year of free credit monitoring--or else, did nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Turn weaknesses into strengths.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is when things start to get graceful; when you can find a way to turn something that should be working against you into an advantage. Haigh isn't a lawyer, and this was his first time in court. But as Shang pointed out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When you're showing up in small claims court, it's not a literal battle between you and the other side. It might feel like it, but you're really trying to impress the judge. It's an arena for regular people to settle grievances. So Christian's weakness--no law degree--became his strength.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Turn strengths into weaknesses.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haigh won, but Equifax appealed the judgment, and it sent a high-powered lawyer from the law firm of King &amp;amp; Spalding to oppose him--along with an in-house lawyer and a company vice president. It would have been natural to be intimidated, but Haigh said he realized this could actually be a good thing for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Equifax, being a large national corporation, part of their litigation strategy is to hire the best people, so they hire King &amp;amp; Spalding. But they're not really thinking through the fact that King &amp;amp; Spalding probably doesn't go to small-claims court very often,&quot; he told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, Haigh writes in his blog post, this benefited him when the company's lead lawyer didn't know (or seemed not to know) that in small claims court, hearsay evidence is admissible. Thus, he wasted time and effort arguing that Haigh shouldn't be allowed to use a report about the Equifax breach from Senator Elizabeth Warren as evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Show up. &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the great philosopher Wayne Gretzky once put it, you miss 100 percent of the shots you don't take. And I guess you lose 100 percent of the small-claims court cases you never get around to filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a no-brainer,&quot; Haigh wrote in his blog post, &quot;but I looked up the woman who came after me as well as the man who preceded me. They both got similar awards, in the $8,000 range. Just showing up to court could mean a significant judgment.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keep showing up.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as I'm punctuating these principles with quotes, how about one supposedly from Winston Churchill: &quot;Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious example of this principle here is the extra effort that Haigh put into winning the appeal--along with his increased &quot;confidence that no matter how stacked the odds are against you, the better case will prevail.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Eat your own dog food.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly don't know if Haigh and Shang filed this suit expecting to fund other people's small-claims cases against Equifax, or if they came up with the idea only afterward. But Shang told me that not long after the data breach story broke, &quot;we actually started getting applications&quot; for funding these kinds of cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's not our main business--our main business is funding business claims, usually,&quot; she said. But she added that with Equifax, &quot;we realized if they pursued their cases in small-claims court, it might be a good opportunity. So we put out an announcement that we would fund Equifax cases, and they really started coming in.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>All disk galaxies rotate once every billion years: study</title>
<link>http://www.astronomy.com/news/2018/03/all-galaxies-rotate-once-every-billion-years</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.astronomy.com/news/2018/03/all-galaxies-rotate-once-every-billion-years</guid>
<description>In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/476/2/1624/4925565&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published March 9 in &lt;em&gt;The Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society&lt;/em&gt;, astronomers announced the discovery that all disk galaxies rotate about once every billion years, no matter their size or mass.&lt;p&gt;“It’s not Swiss watch precision,” said Gerhardt Meurer, an astronomer from the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR), in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icrar.org/cosmic-clocks/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. “But regardless of whether a galaxy is very big or very small, if you could sit on the extreme edge of its disk as it spins, it would take you about a billion years to go all the way round.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Discovering such regularity in galaxies really helps us to better understand the mechanics that make them tick,” he said. “You won’t find a dense galaxy rotating quickly, while another with the same size but lower density is rotating more slowly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To carry out the study, the researchers measured the radial velocities of neutral hydrogen in the outer disks of a plethora of galaxies — ranging from small dwarf irregulars to massive spirals. These galaxies differed in both size and rotational velocity by up to a factor of 30. With these radial velocity measurements, the researchers were able to calculate the rotational period of their sample galaxies, which led them to conclude that the outer rims of all disk galaxies take roughly a billion years to complete one rotation. However, the researchers note that further research is required to confirm the clock-like spin rate is a universal trait of disk galaxies and not just a result of selection bias.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on theoretical models, the researchers also expected to find only sparse populations of young stars and interstellar gas on the outskirts of these galaxies. But instead, they discovered a significant population of much older stars mingling with the young stars and gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is an important result because knowing where a galaxy ends means we astronomers can limit our observations and not waste time, effort, and computer processing power on studying data from beyond that point,” said Meurer. “So because of this work, we now know that galaxies rotate once every billion years, with a sharp edge that’s populated with a mixture of interstellar gas [and] both old and young stars.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering new generations of radio telescopes — like the long-anticipated &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.astronomy.com/news/2017/11/looking-ahead-to-the-square-kilometer-array&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Square Kilometer Array&lt;/a&gt; (SKA) — will produce massive amounts of data, the fact that researchers now have a good idea where a galaxy’s edge lies should also help them significantly reduce the power required to sort through such data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When the SKA comes online in the next decade,” Meurer said, “we’ll need as much help as we can get to characterize the billions of galaxies these telescopes will soon make available to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UX0o9x3c2P4?ecver=1&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;small&gt;Astronomers discovered that all disk galaxies rotate once every billion years, no matter their size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;lbexHangWithMargin&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lbexSectionlevelOLC&quot;&gt;SECTION 1.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;lbexSectionlevelOLC&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lbexAllcap&quot;&gt;Short title&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lbexIndent&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Act may be cited as the “Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act” or the “CLOUD Act”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;lbexHangWithMargin&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lbexSectionlevelOLC&quot;&gt;SEC. 2.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;lbexSectionlevelOLC&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lbexAllcap&quot;&gt;Congressional findings&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lbexIndent&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress finds the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;lbexIndentParagraph&quot;&gt;(1) Timely access to electronic data held by communications-service providers is an essential component of government efforts to protect public safety and combat serious crime, including terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;lbexIndentParagraph&quot;&gt;(2) Such efforts by the United States Government are being impeded by the inability to access data stored outside the United States that is in the custody, control, or possession of communications-service providers that are subject to jurisdiction of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;lbexIndentParagraph&quot;&gt;(3) Foreign governments also increasingly seek access to electronic data held by communications-service providers in the United States for the purpose of combating serious crime.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;lbexIndentParagraph&quot;&gt;(4) Communications-service providers face potential conflicting legal obligations when a foreign government orders production of electronic data that United States law may prohibit providers from disclosing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;lbexIndentParagraph&quot;&gt;(5) Foreign law may create similarly conflicting legal obligations when &lt;a href=&quot;http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title18-chapter121-front&amp;amp;num=0&amp;amp;edition=prelim&quot;&gt;chapter 121&lt;/a&gt; of title 18, United States Code (commonly known as the “Stored Communications Act”), requires disclosure of electronic data that foreign law prohibits communications-service providers from disclosing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;lbexIndentParagraph&quot;&gt;(6) International agreements provide a mechanism for resolving these potential conflicting legal obligations where the United States and the relevant foreign government share a common commitment to the rule of law and the protection of privacy and civil liberties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;lbexIndent&quot;&gt;(a) &lt;span class=&quot;lbexSectionLevelOLCnuclear&quot;&gt;Required preservation and disclosure of communications and records&lt;/span&gt;.— &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;lbexIndentParagraph&quot;&gt;(1) &lt;span&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lbexSmallText&quot;&gt;MENDMENT&lt;/span&gt;.—&lt;a href=&quot;http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title18-chapter121-front&amp;amp;num=0&amp;amp;edition=prelim&quot;&gt;Chapter 121&lt;/a&gt; of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A provider of electronic communication service or remote computing service shall comply with the obligations of this chapter to preserve, backup, or disclose the contents of a wire or electronic communication and any record or other information pertaining to a customer or subscriber within such provider’s possession, custody, or control, regardless of whether such communication, record, or other information is located within or outside of the United States.”.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;lbexIndentParagraph&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lbexIndent&quot;&gt;(2) &lt;span&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lbexSmallText&quot;&gt;ABLE OF SECTIONS&lt;/span&gt;.—The table of sections for &lt;a href=&quot;http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title18-chapter121-front&amp;amp;num=0&amp;amp;edition=prelim&quot;&gt;chapter 121&lt;/a&gt; of title 18, United States Code, is amended by inserting after the item relating to &lt;a href=&quot;http://uscode.house.gov/quicksearch/get.plx?title=18&amp;amp;section=2712&quot;&gt;section 2712&lt;/a&gt; the following:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;lbexIndent&quot;&gt;(b) &lt;span class=&quot;lbexSectionLevelOLCnuclear&quot;&gt;Comity analysis of legal process seeking contents of wire or electronic communication&lt;/span&gt;.—Section 2703 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;lbexIndentParagraph&quot;&gt;“(1) &lt;span&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lbexSmallText&quot;&gt;EFINITIONS&lt;/span&gt;.—In this subsection— &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;lbexIndentClause&quot;&gt;“(ii) the laws of which provide to electronic communication service providers and remote computing service providers substantive and procedural opportunities similar to those provided under paragraphs (2) and (5); and&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;lbexIndentSubpar&quot;&gt;“(B) the term ‘United States person’ has the meaning given the term in section 2523.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;lbexIndentSubpar&quot;&gt;“(i) that the customer or subscriber is not a United States person and does not reside in the United States; and&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;lbexIndentSubpar&quot;&gt;“(ii) that the required disclosure would create a material risk that the provider would violate the laws of a qualifying foreign government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;lbexNonIndentSubpar&quot;&gt;Such a motion shall be filed not later than 14 days after the date on which the provider was served with the legal process, absent agreement with the government or permission from the court to extend the deadline based on an application made within the 14 days. The right to move to quash is without prejudice to any other grounds to move to quash or defenses thereto, but it shall be the sole basis for moving to quash on the grounds of a conflict of law related to a qualifying foreign government.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;lbexIndentParagraph&quot;&gt;“(B) Upon receipt of a motion filed pursuant to subparagraph (A), the court shall afford the governmental entity that applied for or issued the legal process under this section the opportunity to respond. The court may modify or quash the legal process, as appropriate, only if the court finds that— &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;lbexIndentSubpar&quot;&gt;“(i) the required disclosure would cause the provider to violate the laws of a qualifying foreign government;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;lbexIndentSubpar&quot;&gt;“(ii) based on the totality of the circumstances, the interests of justice dictate that the legal process should be modified or quashed; and&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;lbexIndentSubpar&quot;&gt;“(iii) the customer or subscriber is not a United States person and does not reside in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;lbexIndentSubpar&quot;&gt;“(A) the interests of the United States, including the investigative interests of the governmental entity seeking to require the disclosure;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;lbexIndentSubpar&quot;&gt;“(C) the likelihood, extent, and nature of penalties to the provider or any employees of the provider as a result of inconsistent legal requirements imposed on the provider;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;lbexIndentSubpar&quot;&gt;“(D) the location and nationality of the subscriber or customer whose communications are being sought, if known, and the nature and extent of the subscriber or customer’s connection to the United States, or if the legal process has been sought on behalf of a foreign authority pursuant to section 3512, the nature and extent of the subscriber or customer’s connection to the foreign authority’s country;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;lbexIndentSubpar&quot;&gt;“(E) the nature and extent of the provider’s ties to and presence in the United States;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;lbexIndentSubpar&quot;&gt;“(F) the importance to the investigation of the information required to be disclosed;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;lbexIndentSubpar&quot;&gt;“(G) the likelihood of timely and effective access to the information required to be disclosed through means that would cause less serious negative consequences; and&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;lbexIndentSubpar&quot;&gt;“(H) if the legal process has been sought on behalf of a foreign authority pursuant to section 3512, the investigative interests of the foreign authority making the request for assistance.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;lbexIndentParagraph&quot;&gt;“(4) &lt;span&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lbexSmallText&quot;&gt;ISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS DURING PENDENCY OF CHALLENGE&lt;/span&gt;.—A service provider shall preserve, but not be obligated to produce, information sought during the pendency of a motion brought under this subsection, unless the court finds that immediate production is necessary to prevent an adverse result identified in section 2705(a)(2).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;lbexIndentParagraph&quot;&gt;“(5) &lt;span&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lbexSmallText&quot;&gt;ISCLOSURE TO QUALIFYING FOREIGN GOVERNMENT&lt;/span&gt;.— (A) It shall not constitute a violation of a protective order issued under section 2705 for a provider of electronic communication service to the public or remote computing service to disclose to the entity within a qualifying foreign government, designated in an executive agreement under section 2523, the fact of the existence of legal process issued under this section seeking the contents of a wire or electronic communication of a customer or subscriber who is a national or resident of the qualifying foreign government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;lbexIndentParagraph&quot;&gt;“(B) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to modify or otherwise affect any other authority to make a motion to modify or quash a protective order issued under section 2705.”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Assessing gender differences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-2&quot;&gt;What contributes to gender-associated differences in preferences such as the willingness to take risks, patience, altruism, positive and negative reciprocity, and trust? Falk and Hermle studied 80,000 individuals in 76 countries who participated in a Global Preference Survey and compared the data with country-level variables such as gross domestic product and indices of gender inequality. They observed that the more that women have equal opportunities, the more they differ from men in their preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Structured Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;sec-1&quot; class=&quot;subsection&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-5&quot;&gt;Understanding determinants of gender differences in economic and social domains has been of interest, both in academic and public debates. Previous research has shown that gender differences in fundamental economic preferences are important in explaining gender differences in economic outcomes, such as for occupational choice, financial investment, or educational decisions, among many others. However, gaps remain in understanding the sources of gender differences in preferences and their variation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;sec-2&quot; class=&quot;subsection&quot; readability=&quot;28&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;RATIONALE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-6&quot;&gt;We contrasted and tested two hypotheses that make opposite predictions concerning the cross-country association of gender differences in preferences with economic development and gender equality. On one hand, the attenuation of gender-specific social roles that arises in more developed and gender-egalitarian countries may alleviate differences in preferences between women and men. As a consequence, one would expect gender differences in preferences to be negatively associated with higher levels of economic development and gender equality (social role hypothesis). On the other hand, greater availability of material and social resources removes the gender-neutral goal of subsistence, which creates the scope for gender-specific ambitions and desires. In addition, more gender-equal access to those resources may allow women and men to express preferences independently from each other. As a consequence, one would expect gender differences in preferences to be positively associated with higher levels of economic development and gender equality (resource hypothesis).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-7&quot;&gt;We tested these competing predictions using data on experimentally validated measures of willingness to take risks, patience, altruism, positive and negative reciprocity, and trust for 80,000 individuals in 76 representative country samples. So that the data would be geographically representative, the dataset was chosen so as to include all continents and a broad range of cultures and economic development levels. In total, the data represent about 90% of both the world population and global income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;sec-3&quot; class=&quot;subsection&quot; readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-8&quot;&gt;The data revealed substantial cross-country variation in gender differences in preferences. Gender differences were found to be strongly positively associated with economic development as well as gender equality. These relationships held for each preference separately as well as for a summary index of differences in all preferences jointly. Quantitatively, this summary index exhibited correlations of 0.67 (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) with log GDP per capita and 0.56 (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) with a Gender Equality Index (a joint measure of four indices of gender equality), respectively. To isolate the separate impacts of economic development and gender equality, we conducted a conditional analysis, finding a quantitatively large and statistically significant association between gender differences and log GDP per capita conditional on the Gender Equality Index, and vice versa. These findings remained robust in several validation tests, such as accounting for potential culture-specific survey response behavior, aggregation bias, and nonlinear relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;sec-4&quot; class=&quot;subsection&quot; readability=&quot;21.814647377939&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-9&quot;&gt;The reported evidence indicates that higher levels of economic development and gender equality favor the manifestation of gender differences in preferences across countries. Our results highlight the critical role of availability of material and social resources, as well as gender-equal access to these resources, in facilitating the independent formation and expression of gender-specific preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get purge procdump
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Usage: procdump [OPTIONS...] TARGET
   OPTIONS
      -C          CPU threshold at which to create a dump of the process from 0 to 100 * nCPU
      -c          CPU threshold below which to create a dump of the process from 0 to 100 * nCPU
      -M          Memory commit threshold in MB at which to create a dump
      -m          Trigger when memory commit drops below specified MB value.
      -n          Number of dumps to write before exiting
      -s          Consecutive seconds before dump is written (default is 10)
   TARGET must be exactly one of these:
      -p          pid of the process
      -w          Name of the process executable
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Examples&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following examples all target a process with pid == 1234&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following will create a core dump immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo procdump -p 1234
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following will create 3 core dumps 10 seconds apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo procdump -n 3 -p 1234
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following will create 3 core dumps 5 seconds apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo procdump -n 3 -s 5 -p 1234
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following will create a core dump each time the process has CPU usage &amp;gt;= 65%, up to 3 times, with at least 10 seconds between each dump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo procdump -C 65 -n 3 -p 1234
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following will create a core dump each time the process has CPU usage &amp;gt;= 65%, up to 3 times, with at least 5 seconds between each dump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo procdump -C 65 -n 3 -s 5 -p 1234
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following will create a core dump when CPU usage is outside the range [10,65].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo procdump -c 10 -C 65 -p 1234
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following will create a core dump when CPU usage is &amp;gt;= 65% or memory usage is &amp;gt;= 100 MB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo procdump -C 65 -M 100 -p 1234
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All options can also be used with -w instead of -p. -w will wait for a process with the given name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following waits for a process named &lt;code&gt;my_application&lt;/code&gt; and creates a core dump immediately when it is found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo procdump -w my_application
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Currently will only run on Linux Kernels version 3.5+&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does not have full feature parity with Windows version of ProcDump, specifically, stay alive functionality, and custom performance counters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

<title>Apple&amp;#039;s T2 chip will prevent hackers from eavesdropping on your microphone</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/apple-t2-security-chip-microphone-eavesdropping/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/apple-t2-security-chip-microphone-eavesdropping/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;apple&quot;&gt;Apple’s&lt;/a&gt; newest MacBooks include a new feature that makes it far more difficult for hackers or spies to eavesdrop on your microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buried in Apple’s latest range of MacBooks — including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/16/living-with-the-new-15-inch-macbook-pro/&quot;&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; out earlier this year and the just-announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/long-awaited-brand-new-macbook-air-finally-gets-retina-display-and-touch-id/&quot;&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; — is the new T2 security chip, which helps protect the device’s encryption keys, storage, fingerprint data and secure boot features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little was known about the chip until today. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/mac/docs/Apple_T2_Security_Chip_Overview.pdf&quot;&gt;its newest published security guide&lt;/a&gt;, the chip comes with a hardware microphone disconnect feature that physically cuts the device’s microphone from the rest of the hardware whenever the lid is closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This disconnect is implemented in hardware alone, and therefore prevents any software, even with root or kernel privileges in macOS, and even the software on the T2 chip, from engaging the microphone when the lid is closed,” said the support guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The camera isn’t disconnected, however, because its “field of view is completely obstructed with the lid closed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple said the new feature adds a “never before seen” level of security for its Macs, without being quite so blunt as to say: Macs get malware too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emerging threat of hackers tapping into webcams became &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/rat-breeders-meet-the-men-who-spy-on-women-through-their-webcams/&quot;&gt;a reality years ago&lt;/a&gt; when remote administration tools (“RATs”) were used by snoopers to remotely spy on their targets using their in-built laptop camera. That in part led to the emergence of users putting sticky-notes over their webcam lens. It was thought that because &lt;span&gt;Apple’s webcams have a hardware-connected light, making it near-impossible to activate the webcam without a user’s knowledge, Macs were largely immune from webcam snooping attacks. But last year, security researcher Patrick Wardle uncovered the Fruitfly malware that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-analysis-fruitfly-mac-malwware-almost-undetectable-backdoor/&quot;&gt;busted this myth&lt;/a&gt; wide open.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paranoia is real. British intelligence agency GCHQ spent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/27/gchq-nsa-webcam-images-internet-yahoo&quot;&gt;years tapping into webcams&lt;/a&gt; as part of its “Optic Nerve” program. &lt;span&gt;Even Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg reportedly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/22/mark-zuckerberg-tape-webcam-microphone-facebook&quot;&gt;tapes over his webcam&lt;/a&gt; — and his MacBook’s microphone — even though experts say that tape wouldn’t do much to prevent an audio eavesdropper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there are tools &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-attack-can-stealthily-monitor-your-mac-video-calls/&quot;&gt;like Oversight&lt;/a&gt;, an app that Wardle built, that alert a user when their webcam or microphone are activated, there’s little to prevent a sophisticated malware from silently using a MacBook’s microphone to listen to its surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But cutting off the microphone from a MacBook’s hardware when the lid is shut will make it far more difficult for dormant devices to spy on their owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/tag/apple-fall-event-2018/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/apple-fall-event-banner1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Apple Fall Event 2018&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Harvard Converts Millions of Legal Documents into Open Data</title>
<link>http://www.govtech.com/analytics/Harvard-Converts-Millions-of-Legal-Documents-into-Open-Data.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.govtech.com/analytics/Harvard-Converts-Millions-of-Legal-Documents-into-Open-Data.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A new free website spearheaded by the Library Innovation Lab at the Harvard Law School makes available nearly 6.5 million state and federal cases dating from the 1600s to earlier this year, in an initiative that could alter and inform the future availability of similar areas of public-sector big data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by the Lab, which was founded in 2010 as an arena for experimentation and exploration into expanding the role of libraries in the online era, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://case.law/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Caselaw Access Project&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2018/10/29/caselaw-access-project-cap-launches-api-and-bulk-data-service/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;went live&lt;/a&gt; Oct. 29 after five years of discussions, planning and digitization of roughly 100,000 pages per day over two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effort was inspired by the Google Books Project; the Free Law Project, a California 501(c)(3) that provides free, public online access to primary legal sources, including so-called “slip opinions,” or early but nearly final versions of legal opinions; and the Legal Information Institute, a nonprofit service of Cornell University that provides free online access to key legal materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversion, done in-house at the Harvard Law School Library to preserve the chain of custody of millions of cases it had collected, used a hydraulic cutter to trim the binding from thousands of volumes; and a machine similar to those employed in the meatpacking industry to vacuum-seal them after scanning. Scanning costs were in the millions of dollars. Scanned, resealed volumes were shipped out-of-state for long-term storage underground at a former limestone mine in Louisville, Ky. Pages were subsequently uploaded to an optical character recognition (OCR) vendor for extraction into text files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project, which was funded by venture capital-backed startup &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2018/10/29/harvard-law-caselaw/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ravel Law&lt;/a&gt; and the Harvard Law School, doesn’t aggregate every court battle. Its legal trove primarily focuses on supreme court and appellate decisions, but is limited, the Lab’s director said, by the extent to which bygone officials “cared enough at the time” to compile decisions. Director Adam Ziegler said the project has a high concentration of federal trial opinions and lots of trial opinions from the state of New York, an early legal center, but fewer from some other states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In standing up the project website, Ziegler said the Lab hopes to provide “anyone and everyone” with easy access to the law via court opinions, but noted that concept will have different meanings to different groups and “definitely means things we don’t even envision ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every field is trying to learn things from big data these days and this data set has a lot to say about our history, our politics and our policy over time and our language over time. All that kind of stuff is going to be affected or supported by the availability of this data,” Ziegler said, pointing out it may one day power not just legal but language and historical analysis around nomenclature and change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He characterized the Caselaw Project as something of a public interest exercise by Harvard, and does much of the work needed to move this area of the historical record online — and may spur courts to move quickly in publishing their prospectus or future law decisions online for free. Information services like LexisNexis and Ravel — which Lexis &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/about-us/media/press-release.page?id=1496247082681222&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;owns&lt;/a&gt; — could use that free data to create services to improve how residents access the law. Commercial, noncommercial services and academic research could stand near or atop that, Ziegler said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underlying these layers and eventually enabling these multiple services is the project’s application programming interface (&lt;a href=&quot;https://case.law/api/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;API&lt;/a&gt;), with endpoints empowering users to get information on state and federal jurisdictions, courts and case volumes. The site also has bulk data downloads available and some search capabilities, though Ziegler said he expects lots of people to build tools to interface with the API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve taken a lot of time to document and describe the API on our website. We’ve done it in a way that hopefully is accessible both to experts and beginners. We hope it’s fairly self-explanatory, though it’s definitely still kind of intimidating and mysterious to a lot of people, which we understand,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond merely expanding access to the law, the Caselaw Access Project is on the leading edge of a fundamental change in how legal data is made available. Many courts currently charge to access trial cases, but Ziegler said the business of legal data is already changing from preserving exclusivity or scarcity of raw data to creating services, analytics and insight around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s really what should matter,” said Ziegler. “Building businesses around artificial scarcity of public information should not be much of a viable business in this day and age with the Internet. But building really amazing search capabilities, building really amazing analytical insights, building really amazing applications using that data is where all the action is in the future and should be.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Prison time, hefty fines for data privacy violations: draft U.S. Senate bill</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-internet-privacy/prison-time-hefty-fines-for-data-privacy-violations-draft-u-s-senate-bill-idUSKCN1N65U2?</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-internet-privacy/prison-time-hefty-fines-for-data-privacy-violations-draft-u-s-senate-bill-idUSKCN1N65U2?</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior Democratic U.S. senator on Thursday unveiled draft legislation that would allow hefty fines and as much as 20-year prison terms for executives who violate privacy and cybersecurity standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PrimaryAsset_container&quot; readability=&quot;8.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Image_container&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;LazyImage_container LazyImage_dark&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;amp;d=20181101&amp;amp;t=2&amp;amp;i=1321038711&amp;amp;r=LYNXNPEEA03TM&amp;amp;w=20&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;FILE PHOTO: Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) arrives for a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing evaluating the Intelligence Community Assessment on &quot;Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections&quot; on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., May 16, 2018. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Ron Wyden released a draft of legislation that would grant the Federal Trade Commission authority to write privacy regulations. The measure would also allow maximum fines of 4 percent of revenue - matching European rules adopted earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s time for some sunshine on this shadowy network of information sharing,” Wyden said in a statement. “My bill creates radical transparency for consumers, gives them new tools to control their information and backs it up with tough rules.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data privacy has become an increasingly important issue since massive breaches compromised the personal information of millions of U.S. internet and social media users, as well as breaches involving large retailers and credit reporting agency Equifax Inc (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_EFX.N_0”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=EFX.N&quot;&gt;EFX.N&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyden would also create a national “Do Not Track” system to stop companies from tracking internet users by sharing or selling data and targeting advertisements based on their personal information. The bill would also subject senior executives at companies with privacy violations to fines of $5 million or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_FB.O_1”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=FB.O&quot;&gt;FB.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), the world’s largest social media network, said earlier this year that the personal information of about 70 million U.S. users was improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. It said last month that cyber attackers stole data from 29 million Facebook accounts using an automated program that moved from one friend to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, Amazon.com Inc (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_AMZN.O_2”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=AMZN.O&quot;&gt;AMZN.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), Alphabet Inc (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_GOOGL.O_3”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=GOOGL.O&quot;&gt;GOOGL.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), AT&amp;amp;T Inc (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_T.N_4”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=T.N&quot;&gt;T.N&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) and Twitter Inc (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_TWTR.N_5”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=TWTR.N&quot;&gt;TWTR.N&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) all told senators they would back new federal privacy regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator John Thune, who chairs the Commerce Committee, is also working on privacy legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet Association, which represents more than 40 major internet and technology companies, backs modernizing data privacy rules but wants a national approach that would pre-empt new regulations in California that take effect in 2020. The Trump administration is also seeking comments on how to set nationwide data privacy rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union General Data Protection Regulation took effect in May, replacing the bloc’s patchwork of rules dating back to 1995.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking EU privacy laws can result in fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue or 20 million euros ($22.8 million), whichever is higher, as opposed to a few hundred thousand euros.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Iran apparently infiltrated the communications network of CIA agents who allowed their secret websites, used to exchange messages with informants, to be crawled by Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.yahoo.com/news/cias-communications-suffered-catastrophic-compromise-started-iran-090018710.html&quot;&gt;A report&lt;/a&gt; from Yahoo&lt;em&gt;!&lt;/em&gt; News this week claims that a 2009 breach of the US spy bods' communications channels came after the Iranian government infiltrated a series of websites the CIA had used to talk to its sources in places like Iran and China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zach Dorfman, one of the journos behind the Yahoo&lt;em&gt;!&lt;/em&gt; report, previously detailed the CIA's &quot;botched&quot; communications system, from the point of view of China, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/08/15/botched-cia-communications-system-helped-blow-cover-chinese-agents-intelligence/&quot;&gt;over the summer&lt;/a&gt; for Foreign Policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re still dealing with the fallout,” one former national security official was quoted as saying this month. “Dozens of people around the world were killed because of this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;crosshead&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Web scraping is a two-edged sword&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The communications leak was believed to have stemmed from a simple Google search. Suspecting the US had agents and sources within its nuclear program, Iran began to hunt for the mole. After a double agent showed Iran's government one of the sites, they were then able to use Google to identify other sites the intel agency was using, and began to intercept their communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, each of the websites had common elements between them that were found using Google searches. Identify one common element; identify all the sites using that material to link them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Because Google is continuously scraping the internet for information about all the world’s websites, it can function as a tremendous investigative tool — even for counter-espionage purposes,&quot; the report claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;And Google’s search functions allow users to employ advanced operators — like 'AND', 'OR', and other, much more sophisticated ones — that weed out and isolate websites and online data with extreme specificity.&quot; As a result Iran announced the intelligence coup and arrested many operatives. Some were executed, although others managed to escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Iran was able to track down the sites, their techniques were given to other friendly countries, who in turn used the information to weed out the CIA's communications channels in their own territories as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;promo_article&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2018/04/17/shutterstock_pentagons.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1&quot; width=&quot;174&quot; height=&quot;115&quot; alt=&quot;Pentagon - building - houses the US dept of defense in Arlington Virginia&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 title=&quot;Report claims former intel worker believed to be behind data dump&quot;&gt;Ex-CIA man fingered as prime suspect in Vault 7 spy tool manuals leak&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/05/15/vault_7_leak/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;READ MORE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Iran was aggressively going out to hunt systems down,” a former intelligence official said. “They weren’t just protecting themselves anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;crosshead&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The death toll mounts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, Yahoo&lt;em&gt;!&lt;/em&gt; says, citing agency officials, culminated in a 2012 incident in China where 30 agents working for the US were caught and executed. It was previously thought that &quot;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/20/world/asia/china-cia-spies-espionage.html&quot;&gt;more than a dozen&lt;/a&gt;&quot; had been killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CIA does appear to have lucked out when it comes to Russia. The intelligence agency ring fences its Russian activities and the report states that intel chiefs were quick to harden up its Russian communications channel at the first sign of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the rest of the agency had become too reliant on the system, which was originally intended to only be a temporary communications channel, and had left the relatively insecure site up far longer than intended and used it to send information that should have been reserved for more secure channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was never meant to be used long term for people to talk to sources,&quot; the report quotes one official as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The issue was that it was working well for too long, with too many people. But it was an elementary system. Everyone was using it far beyond its intention.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;crosshead&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shooting the messenger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A defense contractor for the CIA named John Reidy claims he warned the agency that it was using insecure communications systems in 2008, and again in 2010 when he started to suspect the channels had been cracked. A year later he was fired by the agency, a move he claims was retaliation for not shutting up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was a recipe for disaster,” Reidy &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article28348576.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. “We had a catastrophic failure on our hands that would ensnare a great many of our sources.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reidy said that he appealed to the CIA's Inspector General and those who were supposed to be providing congressional oversight. No one did anything to sort out the issue and Reidy was sidelined and then sacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is one of the most catastrophic intelligence failures since Sept. 11,” said Irvin McCullough, a national security analyst with the Government Accountability Project. “And the CIA punished the person who brought the problem to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CIA did not respond to a request for comment. ®&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reporting on this project began in mid-2016. To determine which American cities have homeless bus programs, we contacted homelessness, housing or police departments in the 25 largest cities in the country. We also searched for references to bus programs in news archives from the early 1980s onwards. After producing a shortlist, we submitted several dozen public records requests to cities in order to obtain their data. Most of the cities supplied spreadsheets documenting the destinations and dates for individual journeys, some provided the names of travelers and three gave their phone numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To interview people who had taken bus tickets, we called the hundreds of numbers we received, and for the 700 names for which we did not have numbers, we searched for contact details on the Nexis database and sent messages on social media. In addition, reporters in New York, Los Angeles, Portland, Key West and San Juan spent several days visiting shelters and homeless encampments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to accompany a homeless person embarking on a bus journey, we requested introductions from city programs. Owing to reticence from officials, however, two San Francisco-based reporters stationed themselves outside the city’s Homeward Bound office several days a week over a period of a month in order to meet and chat with ticket applicants. Two reporters also rode along with the Reno police department to meet travelers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total these efforts yielded more than 35 narrative accounts of journeys, and we were also able to travel with two homeless people on buses. Complementing these were numerous interviews with program managers and homelessness experts across the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;datapreparationandanalysis&quot;&gt;Data preparation and analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spreadsheets received from the 16 cities and counties required extensive cleaning and categorizing, and the &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities&quot;&gt;US Cities Database&lt;/a&gt; was used to map each bus ticket to a destination based on census data. Although the vast majority of data points had an exact match, when no match was found an algorithm was applied to weed out typing errors. We confirmed each of these suggestions manually. If the destination name was still unclear and an internet search did not produce results, we deleted the row from the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altogether we collated information on 34,000 individuals taking journeys. These were further analyzed to understand trends in age, gender, race, and destinations, as well as changes over time, depending on which variables were available. A large portion of the data comes from either New York or San Francisco, and we bore this in mind when deriving insights from the set. We also noted idiosyncrasies in some programs, for instance in the small scheme in Humboldt County, California, where staff said tickets are in the main given to homeless people but others in need also receive them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;datavisualizations&quot;&gt;Data visualizations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US map&lt;/strong&gt; We analyzed 21,000 journeys taken on the US mainland in 2011-16. To produce per-capita homelessness rates, we used 2016 state homeless population estimates released by the &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/5178/2016-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness/&quot;&gt;Department of Housing and Urban Development&lt;/a&gt; and 2016 state population data from the US Census Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flights from New York&lt;/strong&gt; Using Google Maps APIs (through the &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggmap/index.html&quot;&gt;ggmap package&lt;/a&gt; in R) we attached a geolocation to all of the non-US trips from the New York dataset. We grouped travelers by country and, using the average geolocation of destinations within each country, we calculated the distances from New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difference in mean income of origin and destination cities&lt;/strong&gt; For the mean incomes in the US cities in our dataset, we scraped the &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/community_facts.xhtml&quot;&gt;US Census Factfinder&lt;/a&gt;, cross-referencing with the US Cities Database to ensure the income data was matched to the correct city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;San Francisco’s bus program&lt;/strong&gt; Data from our set was correlated with homeless-count numbers reported to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is intended to give a sense of the bus program’s impact but is only a partial picture, because we do not possess data from every US bus program and many homeless San Franciscans did not arrive by bus: they were originally housed there or came by different means.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Engineers Shouldn’t Write ETL</title>
<link>https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2016/03/16/engineers-shouldnt-write-etl/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2016/03/16/engineers-shouldnt-write-etl/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;“What is the relationship like between your team and the data scientists?” This is, without a doubt, the question I’m most frequently asked when conducting interviews for data platform engineers. It’s a fine question – one that, given the state of engineering jobs in the data space, is essential to ask as part of doing due diligence in evaluating new opportunities. I’m always happy to answer. But I wish I didn’t have to, because this a question that is motivated by skepticism and fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is that? If you read the recruiting propaganda of data science and algorithm development departments in the valley, you might be convinced that the relationship between data scientists and engineers is highly collaborative, organic, and creative. Just like peas and carrots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it’s not a well kept secret that this is seldom the case. Most shops foster a relationship between engineers and scientists that lies somewhere in the spectrum between non-existent&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2016/03/16/engineers-shouldnt-write-etl/#footnote1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and highly dysfunctional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-typical-data-science-department&quot;&gt;A Typical Data Science Department&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most companies structure their data science departments into 3 groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data scientists&lt;/strong&gt;: the folks who are “better engineers than statisticians and better statisticians than engineers”. Aka, “the thinkers”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data engineers&lt;/strong&gt;: these are the folks who build pipelines that feed data scientists with data and take the ideas from the data scientists and implement them. Aka, “the doers”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrastructure engineers&lt;/strong&gt;: these are the folks who maintain the Hadoop cluster / big data infrastructure. Aka, “the plumbers”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data scientists are often frustrated that engineers are slow to put their ideas into production and that work cycles, road maps, and motivations are not aligned. By the time version 1 of their ideas are put into an A/B test, they already have versions 2 and 3 queued up. Their frustration is completely justified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data engineers are often frustrated that data scientists produce inefficient and poorly written code, have little consideration for the maintenance cost of productionizing ideas, demand unrealistic features that skew implementation effort for little gain… The list goes on, but you get the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure engineers get frustrated with everyone for overloading the clusters and filling up disk space. They are kept at arm’s length from the scientists and engineers, which means they never gain a solid context into how the infrastructure is being used, or the business and technical problems that it needs to be used to solve. This makes them feel powerless to improve the situation. Instead, they react by making the infrastructure more restrictive. In turn, everyone becomes frustrated with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a vicious cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-went-wrong&quot;&gt;What Went Wrong?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know that the standard is substandard, and that the recruiting hype is just that. So, why don’t we fix it? Why does every data science and algorithms development team seem to slide into the same dysfunctional model?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I blame two things, offered here in the form of a couple observations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;you-probably-dont-have-big-data&quot;&gt;You Probably Don’t Have Big Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data processing tools and technologies have evolved massively over the last five years. Unless you need to process over many petabytes of data, or you’re ingesting hundreds of billions of events a day, &lt;em&gt;most technologies have evolved to a point where they can trivially scale to your needs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you need to push the boundaries of what these technologies are capable of, you probably don’t need a highly specialized team of dedicated engineers to build solutions on top of them. If you manage to hire them, they will be bored. If they are bored, they will leave you for Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, … – places where their expertise is actually needed. If they are not bored, chances are they are pretty mediocre. Mediocre engineers really excel at building enormously over complicated, awful-to-work-with messes they call “solutions”. Messes tend to necessitate specialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;everybody-wants-to-be-the-thinker&quot;&gt;Everybody Wants to be the “Thinker”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it sounds like such a cool role! You get to sit around all day, think up better ways to do things, and then hand off your ideas to people who eagerly rush to put them into production. Go ahead, pitch it to somebody on the street. I bet they jump at the opportunity! Data scientists, especially those who are newer to the industry and don’t know any better, are especially vocal about desiring such a role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s because we have trained them to desire it. We have bigger, more established companies to thank for that. Companies that had business intelligence departments before the Big Data craze…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A traditional business intelligence department consists of three roles: ETL engineers, report developers, and DBAs. ETL engineers move the data into the data warehouse. They are obsessed with Kimball and his guide to dimensional modeling. Report Developers, on the other hand, are folks who have made a career around designing reports in a specific tool (e.g. Microstrategy, et al). They are specialists. DBAs (and a team of other tool administrators) do their best to just keep things running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing. ETL engineers, Report Developers, and DBAs are all “Doers”. So, 10 years ago or so, when Big Data and data science started to become buzzwords, there were well-established BI departments who had plenty of Doers and not enough Thinkers. So, they made “Thinker” a role. We integrated data scientists with established BI departments by promising them the ability to fiddle around with data and change the course of the business. In reality, this didn’t happen. These data scientists occasionally manage to create some pretty cool and effective solutions, but by and large they focus on performing slightly higher level Report Developer-ing back to the business (which largely ignores their advice).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the role sounds really nice, and &lt;em&gt;it’s easy to recruit for&lt;/em&gt;. Thus was born the traditional, modern day data science department: data scientists (Report developers aka “thinkers”), data engineers (ETL engineers aka “doers”), and infrastructure engineers (DBAs aka “plumbers”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whoops.&lt;/em&gt; It would seem that the business intelligence department never really changed, we just added a Hadoop cluster and started calling it by a new name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-it-really-that-bad&quot;&gt;Is it Really that Bad?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In truth, it depends what you’re looking to achieve. If you buy in to the argument above, then you have to accept that it has allowed companies to get by for many, many years… since the advent of BI. But I believe it’s a terribly inefficient model if you want your data science team to truly do more than build PowerPoint decks and dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental flaw that prevents the Thinker and Doer model from living up to its recruiting hype is the assumption that there exists an army of soulless non-mediocre Doer engineers who eagerly implement the ideas and vision of data scientists. Does that sound like the profile of any talented engineers that you know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this model the Doers are solely accountable for implementation, failure, and support of other people’s ideas, while the Thinker is rewarded for their success. This is at the heart of the contention and misalignment between the teams. It creates an IT group rather than an engineering team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to attract talented engineers into a role like that, you need some really big scaling problems to serve as a distraction to the soulless, subservient role you have hired them into. You need the type of problems created by the existence of Big Data. And, I’m sorry, but you don’t have Big Data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, you will hire mediocre engineers. They will create tremendously over complicated messes. This will exacerbate the contention. &lt;em&gt;Welcome to the Vicious Cycle&lt;/em&gt;. The end result is a team of data scientists who are empowered to be little more than report developers because they lack the support of a solid, innovative data platform. And if your recruiting hype had pitched them on the Report Developer role, they would have run the other way. &lt;strong&gt;After all, they’re Thinkers, not Doers!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-different-kind-of-data-science-department&quot;&gt;A Different Kind of Data Science Department&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than try to emulate the structure of well-known companies (who made the transition from BI to DS), we need to innovate and evolve the model! &lt;em&gt;No more trying to design faster horses…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple years ago, I moved to Stitch Fix for just that very reason. At Stitch Fix, we strive to be Best in the World at the algorithms and analytics we produce. We strive to lead the business with our output rather than to inform it. Unless you’re willing to boldly challenge and rethink the things you know to be substandard, that is a damn hard proposition to fulfill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After seeing the department grow and develop over the last two years, I am confident to share what we are up to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that the goal is to lead rather than to inform, I would like to propose to you what I believe is A Better Way to structure a data science department. &lt;em&gt;A way that allows for autonomy in roles, true ownership all the way into production, and accountability for output.&lt;/em&gt; A way that is well suited for a company with a quickly evolving business (and data) model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What follows is a blueprint for building a data science team that can pivot and react quickly, so as to &lt;strong&gt;lead and innovate&lt;/strong&gt; through the production of thought-leadership, APIs, and code, rather than react to changes and throw together some PowerPoint presentations in a desperate attempt to redirect gut feelings and intuitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;enable-everyone-to-be-best-in-the-world&quot;&gt;Enable Everyone to be Best in the World&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s forget the traditional roles, and instead think about the intrinsic motivations that get folks excited to come to work in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of role, a fundamental differentiator between adequate and great people lies in their desire and talent for being creative. Great people are able to identify and creatively solve problems that would absolutely baffle the mediocre. They excel in and crave for an environment of autonomy, ownership, and focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assembly line handoff from scientist to engineer creates the polar opposite environment. (Truth is, even the Thinker resents having to rely on the Doer). The trick is to create an environment that allows for autonomy, ownership, and focus for everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is important to recognize that engineers and data scientists are impassioned by very different tasks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data Scientists&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data scientists love working on problems that are vertically aligned with the business and make a big impact on the success of projects/organization through their efforts. They set out to optimize a certain thing or process or create something from scratch. These are point-oriented problems and their solutions tend to be as well. They usually involve a heavy mix of business logic, reimagining of how things are done, and a healthy dose of creativity. Thus, they require a deep understanding of how specific portions of the business operate and a high degree of partnership with business verticals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engineers&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineers excel in a world of abstraction, generalization, and finding efficient solutions in the places where they are needed. These problems are usually horizontally oriented in nature. They can be most impactful when applied broadly. They require a good overall understanding of how the business operates, but the abstracted nature of solutions mean they are light on business logic and do not require a heavy partnership with or deep understanding of verticals within the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;hybrid-thinker-doers&quot;&gt;Hybrid Thinker-Doers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common fear of engineers in the data space is that, regardless of the job description or recruiting hype you produce, you are secretly searching for an ETL engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you did not realize it, &lt;strong&gt;Nobody enjoys writing and maintaining data pipelines or ETL&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s the industry’s ultimate hot potato. It really shouldn’t come as a surprise then that ETL engineering roles are the archetypal breeding ground of mediocrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engineers should not write ETL.&lt;/em&gt; For the love of everything sacred and holy in the profession, this should not be a dedicated or specialized role. There is nothing more soul sucking than writing, maintaining, modifying, and supporting ETL to produce data that you yourself never get to use or consume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, give people end-to-end ownership of the work they produce (autonomy). In the case of data scientists, that means ownership of the ETL. It also means ownership of the analysis of the data and the outcome of the data science. The best-case outcome of many efforts of data scientists is an artifact meant for a machine consumer, not a human one. Rather than a report, dashboard, or PowerPoint presentation, it is some sort of algorithm or API that is integrated into the engineering stack – something that fundamentally changes the operation of the business. Autonomy means the data scientists own that code as well. &lt;em&gt;All the way into production.&lt;/em&gt; They should be able to develop and deploy it without asking the permission of engineers, be accountable for support, be held to performance, latency, and SLA requirements, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This puts vertical responsibility and focus squarely into the hands of data scientists. But, data scientists are not typically classically trained or highly skilled software engineers. You could say they are adequate, at best. So you would expect that they would create a Big Mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one reason why ETL and API / production algorithm development is typically handed off to an engineer in assembly line style. But, all of those tasks are inherently vertically (point) focused. &lt;em&gt;Talented engineers in the data space are almost always best focused on horizontal applications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, then, what is the role of an engineer in this new, horizontal world? To sum it up, engineers must deploy platforms, services, abstractions, and frameworks that allow the data scientists to conceive of, develop, and deploy their ideas with autonomy (such as a tool, framework, or service used to build, schedule, and execute ETL). I like to think of it in terms of Lego blocks. Engineers design new Lego blocks that data scientists assemble in creative ways to create new data science. This is definitely easier said than done, but:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineer’s work can be completely horizontal in nature. This allows them to focus on building technology that is broadly applicable across multiple data science problems. This maximizes leverage of engineering output. Which is great, since you probably have far more data scientists than you do engineers in your data science department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineers get to focus on what they do best: abstracting, generalizing, and creating efficient, scalable solutions where they are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineers get to operate with autonomy. The production from an engineering team deployed in this manner should look like “magic”. Things should just “fall into place” for the data scientists because their needs are anticipated and the scaling and resiliency is taken care of the platform, services, and frameworks they are using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for this to work well, most of the time the engineers need to anticipate the needs of the data scientists. They should be developing multiple steps ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For highly talented and creative engineers and data scientists, it’s a hell of a lot more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-the-scientists-do-all-the-work&quot;&gt;So, the Scientists Do All The Work?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, not at all. If anything, engineers have a much more challenging and demanding role than they do in the standard model. The data scientists probably do as well. We are not optimizing the organization for efficiency, we are optimizing for autonomy. What is offered is clear ownership of ideas and accountability for their delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are roles that are very attractive to folks who embrace an entrepreneurial mindset. It allows for quick movement, eliminates the need for building unnecessary consensus, and opens the door to disruptive innovation. But it does come at the cost of specialization, and thus efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expectation, however, is not that data scientists are going to suddenly become talented engineers. Nor is it that the engineers will be ignorant of all business logic and vertical initiatives. In fact, partnership is inherent to the success of this model. Engineers should see themselves as being “Tony Stark’s tailor”, building the armor that prevents data scientists from falling into pitfalls that yield unscalable or unreliable solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of abstractions and frameworks for rolling out solutions, engineers partner with scientists to create solutions. But, not in the form of a hand off. Rather, the engineering challenge becomes one of building self-service components such that the data scientists can iterate autonomously on the business logic and algorithms that deliver their ideas to the business. After the initial roll out of a solution, it is clear who owns what. The engineers own the infrastructure that they build, and the data scientists own the business logic and algorithm implementations that they provide. No form of tight coupling is required to iterate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-challenging-road&quot;&gt;A Challenging Road&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you may be skeptical that it’s possible to pull something like this off. However, I think the payoff is well worth the risk. Here are a couple of things to watch out for that can hamper or revert progress:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;People are averse to change.&lt;/em&gt; People tend to want to recreate environments that they are used to working in. This creates pressure to revert to the Thinker-Doer model. New hires need to get on board with the new structure quickly. Vigilance is especially warranted when a project encounters problems – e.g. an API breaks or an algorithm serves bad results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People behave in a very reactive way in those circumstances. They will insist that engineers should take over. But, they are addressing a symptom rather than the problem. Engineers should instead build in better platform support, visibility, abstractions, and resilience. And, they should realize that engineers break things too… no one is immune from making a mistake and breaking production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is absolutely essential for platform engineers to stay ahead of the data science teams.&lt;/em&gt; You need very sharp platform engineers who can make intuitive decisions about what services, frameworks, and capabilities need to be in place before they are desperately needed. The lack of hand off from scientist to engineer means that the engineers do not get the luxury of reacting to requirements delivered by the scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the engineers are creating lego blocks, and the data science teams are assembling them. If the data science teams don’t have to right blocks to assemble, they will forge ahead nonetheless to create a solution. They’ll solve their problem either by assembling the wrong blocks (square peg in a round hole), or by creating their own. Usually, they will create a Big Mess. One that is hard to undo once it has been created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-fear-inefficiency&quot;&gt;Don’t Fear Inefficiency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A consequence of empowering data scientists to take on such a breadth of the stack is that they will be unlikely to produce code and solutions that are as technically efficient as an engineer’s. We are sacrificing technical efficiency for velocity and autonomy. It is important to recognize this as a deliberate trade off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, however, a set of less obvious efficiencies that are gained with end-to-end ownership. The data scientists are experts in the domain of the implementations they are producing. Thus, they are well equipped to make trade offs between technical and support costs vs. requirements. For example, they can decide to sample data in certain places, use approximate methods where they make sense, and make decisions to nix or punt features that may produce only very marginal business impacts but come with extremely high development or support costs. These things seldom happen (and when they do, usually require numerous negotiations) in the assembly line model of hand off between scientists and engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In aggregate, it is hoped that the benefits of autonomy and the innovation that can be produced as a result will outweigh the technical inefficiencies of the lack of technical specialization in allowing data scientists to own their full stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-future&quot;&gt;The Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll make no claim that we have discovered the best way to structure a data science department, or that this is the best structure for your organization. But, it is definitely not an attempt to build a faster horse and I feel strongly it is a better solution for Stitch Fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It’s my sincere hope that in sharing what we have done that it will encourage others with a non-traditionally structured department to do the same, inspire leaders of data science departments that are in a formative stage to think outside the box and find the courage to challenge tradition, and inform engineers and data scientists who are frustrated by traditional roles that there are different types of environments available to operate in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Ask an engineer interviewing you where the data scientists sit (or vice versa). If they don’t know, don’t walk… Run. &lt;a href=&quot;https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2016/03/16/engineers-shouldnt-write-etl/#footnote1-return&quot;&gt;←&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

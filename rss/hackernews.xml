<title>Intel Publishes Microcode Patches, No Benchmarking or Comparison Allowed</title>
<link>https://perens.com/2018/08/22/new-intel-microcode-license-restriction-is-not-acceptable/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://perens.com/2018/08/22/new-intel-microcode-license-restriction-is-not-acceptable/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Intel is updating its loadable CPU microcode to handle various side-channel and timing attacks. There is a new license term applied to the new microcode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will not, and will not allow any third party to (i) use, copy, distribute, sell or offer to sell the Software or associated documentation; (ii) modify, adapt, enhance, disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer, change or create derivative works from the Software except and only to the extent as specifically required by mandatory applicable laws or any applicable third party license terms accompanying the Software; (iii) use or make the Software available for the use or benefit of third parties; or (iv) use the Software on Your products other than those that include the Intel hardware product(s), platform(s), or software identified in the Software; or &lt;strong&gt;(v) publish or provide any Software benchmark or comparison test results.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the microcode is running for every instruction, this seems to be a use restriction on the entire processor. Don’t run your benchmarker at all, not even on your own software, if you “provide” or publish the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security fixes are known to significantly slow down Intel processors, which won’t just disappoint customers and reduce the public regard of Intel, it will probably lead to lawsuits (if it hasn’t already). Suddenly having processors that are perhaps 5% to 10% slower, if they are to be secure, is a significant damage to many companies that run server farms or provide cloud services. I’m not blaming Intel for this, I don’t know if Intel could have forseen the problem. Since some similar exploits have been discovered for AMD and ARM CPUs, the answer is probably “no”. But certainly customers are upset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another issue is whether the customer should install the fix at all. Many computer users don’t allow outside or unprivileged users to run on their CPUs the way a cloud or hosting company does. For them, these side-channel and timing attacks are mostly irrelevant, and the slowdown incurred by installing the fix is unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, lots of people are interested in the speed penalty incurred in the microcode fixes, and &lt;strong&gt;Intel has now attempted to gag anyone who would collect information for reporting about those penalties, through a restriction in their license. &lt;/strong&gt;Bad move. The correct way to handle security problems is to own up to the damage, publish mitigations, and make it possible for your customers to get along. Hiding how they are damaged is unacceptable. Silencing free speech by those who would merely publish benchmarks? Bad business. Customers can’t trust your components when you do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In writing this story, I used news in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/08/21/intel_cpu_patch_licence/&quot;&gt;this article in The Register&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/z2F3Cj6R8Q/&quot;&gt;this copy of the license&lt;/a&gt;. That’s all the information I have on this issue, at this writing.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Apocalyptic Architecture of One 1970s Retail Chain</title>
<link>https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/best-superstores-architecture</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/best-superstores-architecture</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;section-start-text&quot;&gt;In 1974, the American home&lt;/span&gt; goods retailer Best Products opened a new location in Houston, Texas. Crowds gathered for the event, and local news trucks filmed the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;But people weren’t there to shop. Everyone was in the parking lot, waiting for two helicopters to lift a massive black shroud off of the building, like a giant magic trick. When they finally pulled it away, the crowd burst into applause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;From 1972 to 1984, Best Products collaborated with the design firm SITE to transform many of its stores into stunning and bizarre works of art. These special showrooms, as they were called, generated fanfare, admiration, and controversy across the United States. They were hotly debated in architecture circles, and ultimately became textbook examples of of postmodern architecture—playful and critical, providing mass appeal while challenging assumptions about how “serious” art should look, and where it should be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png&quot; alt=&quot;The &amp;quot;Tilt Building&amp;quot; in Towson, Maryland.&quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-58007&quot; data-src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/58007/image.jpg&quot;/&gt;The “Tilt Building” in Towson, Maryland. &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.siteenvirodesign.com/content/best-products&quot;&gt;Courtesy of SITE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;By the mid-1990s, they had all disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;SITE was founded in 1970 by a multidisciplinary group of New York artists, and led by James Wines, a sculptor steeped in the downtown New York arts scene. Prior to founding the firm Wines often took public-art commissions, which at the time usually meant making large sculptures in urban public spaces. With abstract, monumental pieces like &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwm.edu/libraries/about/sculptures/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three Bronze Discs&lt;/em&gt; (1967)&lt;/a&gt;, Wines was finding the kind of success that many sculptors dreamed of. And he was sick of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;“I was designing turds in a plaza,” Wines describes. Wines wanted to break free of the form, which felt like it promoted work that could be found in any plaza or skyscraper lobby in the world—from Lower Manhattan to Louisville to Luxembourg. “Plop Art,” Wines likes to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Two of Wines’s patrons in this period were Sydney and Francis Lewis. They owned Best Products, a catalogue retailer that sold discounted goods in hybrid showroom/warehouses (sort of like Ikea). Selling everything from hair dryers to toaster ovens to doll-houses, they were proto-big box stores—“medium box stores,” as their son and former Best president Andy Lewis puts it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;The Lewises were avid art collectors, and as the company grew they became interested in bringing public art in their their showrooms. They turned to Wines, who by the late 1960s had become not only one of their favorite young artists, but also a good friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Wines is in his 80s today, but still has the excitable temperament of a young artist looking to surprise. He smiles when he talks about those first discussions with the Lewises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;“I think, at first, they imagined I would just put a sculpture in front of the store,’ Wines says. But that wasn’t the kind of proposal he gave them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Their first collaboration, for a new showroom in Richmond, Virginia, was ingeniously simple. It featured a brick facade layered in front of a generic box store, bound with a special mortar that let the bricks seemingly defy gravity. The facade curled away from the building at its edges, like drying paper. It was called the “Peeling Building.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png&quot; alt=&quot;The &amp;quot;Peeling Building.&amp;quot;&quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-58009&quot; data-src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/58009/image.jpg&quot;/&gt;The “Peeling Building.” &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.siteenvirodesign.com/content/best-products&quot;&gt;Courtesy of SITE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;According to Andy Lewis, when the store opened in 1971 people visited just to see the facade in person. One neighbor even called the Lewises to tell them their new showroom was severely damaged. The “Peeling Building” soon became their best performing showroom. The Lewises decided to collaborate with Wines and SITE on another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;For the “Indeterminate Facade Building” in Houston, the opening of the store was turned into a major event. When helicopters finally lifted the black shroud off the building, what was revealed looked pretty mundane—until the top. The white facade rose two stories above the building and ended at a jagged, crooked line of bricks. A large V appeared punched out of it, with a pile of brick rubble below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;At the opening, a local whom Wines had never met walked straight up to him, with an intensity that put him on edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;“I thought he was gonna try and fight me,” Wines says. “‘Did you do that?’ He asked. I told him I did. ‘I love it! That’s what I always have wanted to do, kick the &lt;em&gt;shit&lt;/em&gt; out of one of those buildings.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Some architects, though, didn’t view the showrooms so kindly. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.architecturalrecord.com/ext/resources/archives/backissues/1977-05.pdf?231307200&quot;&gt;May 1977 issue&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Architectural Record&lt;/em&gt; contains several scathing letters to the editor, including one from a California-based reader who called the buildings “an affront to human dignity, an insult to architectural innovativeness and stooping to the lowest on the altar of gimmickry.” A construction company owner in New York suggested SITE, Inc. be given the architectural award for “Sheer Lunacy.” For some designers and critics, there was just no room for playful suburban shopping centers in the world of fine architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Wines was too busy to debate the point though; Best Products was growing fast in the 70s and 80s, and there were more showrooms to design. Over the next few years came seven more. There was the “Notch Building” in Sacramento, a solid concrete box with one corner that would slide out to create an entrance when it opened each day, and slide back in at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png&quot; alt=&quot;The opening of the &amp;quot;Notch&amp;quot; in Sacramento.&quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-58011&quot; data-src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/58011/image.jpg&quot;/&gt;The opening of the “Notch” in Sacramento. &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.siteenvirodesign.com/content/best-products&quot;&gt;Courtesy of SITE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;In Richmond, Virginia, the “Forest Building” was designed to look like a big box store that had been sitting for decades in a vacant lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png&quot; alt=&quot;The &amp;quot;Forest Building&amp;quot; in Richmond, Virginia was designed to look like it had been overgrown after sitting abandoned in a lot.&quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-58008&quot; data-src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/58008/image.jpg&quot;/&gt;The “Forest Building” in Richmond, Virginia was designed to look like it had been overgrown after sitting abandoned in a lot. &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.siteenvirodesign.com/content/best-products&quot;&gt;Courtesy of SITE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;The “Inside/Out Building” in Milwaukee had a cutaway section that appeared to expose the interior to the outside, like a real-life architectural cross-section.“They cost more than regular buildings, but they added such PR value. Often they were our best-performing stores,” Andy Lewis explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Inside/Out,&amp;quot; Milwaukee, circa 1994.&quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-58012&quot; data-src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/58012/image.jpg&quot;/&gt;“Inside/Out,” Milwaukee, circa 1994. &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.siteenvirodesign.com/content/best-products&quot;&gt;Courtesy of SITE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;By the late ’80s though, a creeping consolidation of big-box retailers had begun, and Best Products started to struggle. After two bankruptcies in 1991 and 1996, the company closed for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Unlike more monumental architecture of the era, no one seems to have thought to preserve these big-box stores. Describing the fate of the Houston showroom in a 2003 &lt;em&gt;Metropolis&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metropolismag.com/uncategorized/best-thing-going-2/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, architectural historian Stephen Fox put it this way: “there’s not much sentiment here for preserving suburban landmarks.” Over the years the showrooms were bought and sold, remodeled and torn down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;There is still one place, though, where admirers can catch a glimpse of what once was. On a strip-mall-lined stretch of Quioccasin Road in Richmond, Virginia sits the West End Presbyterian Church. It has a brick facade with a courtyard just behind it. It was once the “Forest Building.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;When it opened as a Best showroom in 1978, the building was covered in weeds, with trees seeming to burst out from its interior. In 2000, when The West End Church converted the building to a house of worship, they hired very responsible architects to civilize the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;The church’s website mentions the building’s unique history, and architecture students have begun making trips there to see it themselves. To Wines though, it’s not really worth visiting—the tasteful and orderly renovation almost felt like a defacement. “It was like they surgically removed all the art from the building,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf item-body-last&quot;&gt;Robert Venturi and Denise Scott-Brown, icons of ‘70s and ‘80s postmodern architecture, were fans of SITE’s special showrooms. (In 1978, as Best Products was rapidly expanding, they actually &lt;a href=&quot;http://venturiscottbrown.org/pdfs/BestProducts01.pdf&quot;&gt;designed one themselves&lt;/a&gt;.) Once, when discussing the special showrooms with Wines, Venturi said something to him that would prove prophetic: “Make sure to take lots of pictures. In about 15 minutes they’ll start to change it.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Open source takes continued investment, and that must be subsidized somehow</title>
<link>https://www.influxdata.com/blog/its-time-for-the-open-source-community-to-get-real/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.influxdata.com/blog/its-time-for-the-open-source-community-to-get-real/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like many open source developers, I’ve been reading the commentary around&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://redislabs.com/community/commons-clause/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Redis Common Clause Licensing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;with great interest (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17814386&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;HN thread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;). The gist of it is that work on certain enterprise modules for Redis that are developed by RedisLabs will be licensed under the Apache Common Clause license, which will prohibit them from being used freely by hosting and cloud providers and other software makers that profit directly from them. Redis will continue to be developed primarily under the sponsorship of RedisLabs under the liberal BSD-3-Clause license. There seemed to be some initial confusion that Redis itself was getting relicensed, which Salvatore (antirez)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/antirez/status/1032180321834467330&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;has been&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;trying to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://antirez.com/news/120&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;clear up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite that confusion, I don’t think the community’s outrage is driven largely by that. RedisLabs’ post wasn’t ambiguous about the licensing of Redis itself. I think most of the community outrage will continue even with that clarification. I think most of the people that actually read the RedisLabs post understood what was going on. They’re just not being honest with themselves about the realities of developing and driving the success of open source software. In short, it takes continued investment, and that must be subsidized somehow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I spoke last year about&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.influxdata.com/blog/the-open-source-database-business-model-is-under-siege/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;the difficulties of building a business on open source software&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;and the fact that OSS is always subsidized either through people’s free time or some other successful business. Building a business in the open source infrastructure space has become much harder over the last few years because of the cloud providers continued march across the entire infrastructure software market. This is exactly what’s driving RedisLabs’ decision on this licensing move. Their move makes sense for the business and, more importantly, for the longevity of the open source Redis project. Why do I say it makes sense for Redis’ longevity? Because longevity means continued investment, and that money and time has to come from somewhere. Let’s quickly review the different ways to subsidize an open source project.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Developers free time is where it often starts. This means individuals writing code and documentation in their evenings and weekends. This is usually in addition to a full time software development job, which is ultimately what pays their bills. This model doesn’t scale and I would argue isn’t a valid option even at the small scale of libraries. If you have a library of any amount of complexity, it will take continued effort to fix bugs and evolve it. Otherwise you end up locking it down and sealing it off as “done”. If you have a larger project, the realities of it being driven by free time contributions are even worse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The more successful approach is to have open source be the exhaust of some other successful business. Facebook and Google produce significant open source projects mostly subsidized by successful advertising businesses. However, there are frequently hidden motives for these projects. For example, Google puts significant investment into Kubernetes, but it’s also in their financial best interest to do so. It commodotizes the software of the cloud platform, which gives them the perfect wedge to get into the market currently dominated by AWS. Understanding the motives of the organizations that are driving the open source projects you love is important because if the financial realities change, their support for that project could dry up. And an OSS project without any support is one that is sure to die over some period of time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then we have open core. A company produces an open source project (the core) and then creates proprietary software in or around that project which they license or provide as a service. This is obviously the model that RedisLabs is pursuing. It’s also our model here at InfluxData and the model of many other open source companies. The revenue derived from the closed source software drives continued improvement on the open source front.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lastly, we have consulting and support, which I think is a dead end. It certainly works on a smaller scale with individual developers, but it falls apart when trying to build a company. Most of the time you’d be better served by picking some other open source project that is successful and building a consulting practice around that. Then you have your developers billing hours to clients rather than writing code that results in zero financial activity for their employer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Matt Klein, creator of Envoy, was&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattklein123/status/1032115153335017473?s=11&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;arguing on Twitter for the foundation approach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Basically, put the open source under the stewardship of a foundation and have the development funded by grants from that foundation. However, I don’t think that’s scalable and it has the same problem of determining where the subsidy comes from. Look at the paying members of the CNCF or the sponsors at CloudNativeCon (run by the CNCF). They certainly bring in money from all that, but that is driven either by VC money from startups trying to build businesses around CNCF projects, or from large successful companies trying to hire developers or pursue their own financial interests around those projects. Also, this assumes a certainly level of scale for the project in question, which typically requires years of investment to even get to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I don’t want to pick too much on Matt, because I’m a big fan of his work and of him as a person. But what happens if the gravy train dries up at Lyft (his current sponsor for all his work on Envoy)? He’ll have to look for a new sponsor, which he’ll almost certainly find, but it’ll also be tricky because he’ll have to make sure their motives align with his own for the Envoy project (which are as pure and laudable as I’ve seen in the OSS community). Envoy will continue to live and die by the largesse afforded by successful technology companies that sponsor its development through full time developer salaries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That brings me to another unspoken truth about open source software, which is that the organization that “owns” a project is generally the one that employs the most developers that contribute to it. RedHat knows this, which is why they frequently do acquihires of popular OSS projects. Venture capitalists also know this, which is why they conduct an oil rush style land grab to either fund, or get their portfolio companies to acquihire the primary contributors of any hot new open source project.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Open core is a fairly honest way to go about developing open source software. As long as you’re clear about what is open and what is closed. Within InfluxDB, our dividing line is that anything related to high availability or scale out clustering is kept as a closed source commercial product while anything in the single server realm is open source (but we’ve been moving some network code into our open source recently, which I’ll talk about in a little bit).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The accusation that RedisLabs did a bait and switch is entirely unfair. They’ve been funding open source Redis development for years and that work is now and will be in the future under the liberal BSD license. It’s not like they tricked a bunch of people into using Redis and pulled the rug out from under them. I’m sure that more than 99.99% of the Redis users are completely unaffected by this. And for those others, it’s not like the code that’s already out there is unusable. To my knowledge they can’t retroactively apply the license. So we’re really only talking about forward development to specific modules (not Redis core).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Redis is a fantastic piece of software. I’ve used it at multiple jobs, I’ve given&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://videos.goruco.com/2011/paul-dix-indexing-thousands-of-writes-per-second-with-redis&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;talks at conferences about it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and I’ve recommended it to people. This announcement changes nothing about that. The only thing it does is show me that RedisLabs is aggressive about ensuring the company’s longevity and, with it, Redis itself. As long as RedisLabs is around and profitable, they’ll be able to subsidize and sponsor open source Redis development. Don’t like their direction? You can fork and you can even do it with whatever’s current when you make that move. Before you start freaking out, let the continued development in pure open source BSD licensed Redis inform your opinion, not a bunch of fear-mongering.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In software development, we appreciate that most things in software are all about tradeoffs. Developing a distributed system? Gotta pick AP or CP and decide which tradeoff is for you. Trying to ship a release? Gotta pick the features that really matter or the timeline that’s more important, more tradeoffs. I argue that the same is true of open source licensing and open source funding models.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In open source licensing the tradeoffs are about what people can do with your software. If you’re going with a license like MIT or Apache2, you have to be prepared for anyone to take your software and do whatever they want with it, including making more money off derivative works of it than you do. However, it’s easier to build a bigger community and get more people contributing because they can do anything they want with it. If you care about making sure that anyone that takes your code contributes it back to the community, you pick GPL2 or AGPL. The tradeoff there is that you limit the commercial options for developers that might want to build a business with your code.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The licenses and tradeoffs there generally feed into the funding model. Open source must be funded somehow. I don’t think there’s a one-size-fits-all or silver bullet to this. Open core, big business exhaust, foundations, and dual licensing all lead to models that fund development.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s these sets of tradeoffs that InfluxData thinks about when we open source software. For example, we’ve chosen to license&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.influxdata.com/blog/why-were-building-flux-a-new-data-scripting-and-query-language/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Flux, our new language&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, under the very permissive MIT license. Flux also has code to query open source InfluxDB servers over the network, which goes beyond where we normally partition open source versus closed. However, our goal is to get it as wide adoption and contribution as possible, which means that we want developers to use it for fun projects, commercial projects, building companies and everything in between. What this means is that we’re prepared for others to profit from the existence of Flux.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I measure our success with getting Flux into the world with a series of milestones. First would be getting InfluxDB users using the language. Second would be to get users of Flux outside the context of InfluxDB itself. Third is if and when we see other open source projects adopting Flux as a language. Finally is if and when we see companies (and competitors) adopting Flux as a language and deriving revenue from it. We’re prepared for all of those because that’s what success looks like for this piece of open source we’re working on. However, that doesn’t preclude us from continuing to develop closed source software in the commercial version of InfluxDB that we drive revenue from to subsidize this open source development.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ultimately, I think the open source community needs to take a deep breath and think about the realities of OSS development. This work isn’t free and it costs people’s time, effort, and passion. The last is one I connect with on a personal level because I appreciate how taxing it can be over years of continued effort. These things don’t come free and if a company like RedisLabs happens to be commercializing some part of Redis while still contributing a significant amount to freely available permissive BSD Redis, they should be commended, not attacked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>Like many open source developers, I’ve been reading the commentary around Redis Common Clause Licensing with great interest (HN thread). The gist of it is that work on certain enterprise modules for Redis that are developed by RedisLabs will be licensed under the Apache Common Clause license, which will prohibit them from being used freely …</og:description>

<description>&lt;p name=&quot;6649&quot; id=&quot;6649&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;by Brian Chambers, Caleb Hurd, Sean Drucker, Alex Crane, Morgan McEntire, Jamie Roberts, and Laura Jauch (the Chick-fil-A IOT/Edge team)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6748&quot; id=&quot;6748&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@cfatechblog/bare-metal-k8s-clustering-at-chick-fil-a-scale-7b0607bd3541&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@cfatechblog/bare-metal-k8s-clustering-at-chick-fil-a-scale-7b0607bd3541&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, we shared about how we do bare metal clustering for Kubernetes on-the-fly at the Edge in our restaurants. One of the most common (and best) questions we got was “but why?”. In the post we will answer that question.

&lt;h3 name=&quot;5fb1&quot; id=&quot;5fb1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Why K8s in a restaurant?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2635&quot; id=&quot;2635&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Why does a restaurant company like Chick-fil-A want to deploy Kubernetes at the Edge? What are the goals? That, we can answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;3b2a&quot; id=&quot;3b2a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Low-latency, internet-independent applications that can reliably run our business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;88d0&quot; id=&quot;88d0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;High availability for these applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;c53e&quot; id=&quot;c53e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Platform that enables rapid innovation and that allows delivery of business functionality to production as quickly as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;0bff&quot; id=&quot;0bff&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Horizontal scale — infrastructure and application development teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 name=&quot;b15d&quot; id=&quot;b15d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Capacity Pressures&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a8a2&quot; id=&quot;a8a2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Chick-fil-A is a very successful company in large part because of our fantastic food and &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2018/07/05/best-fast-food-restaurant-2018/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2018/07/05/best-fast-food-restaurant-2018/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;customer service&lt;/a&gt; — both the result of the great people that operate and work in our restaurants. They are unmatched in the industry. The result is &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; busy restaurants. If you have been to a Chick-fil-A restaurant, this is not news to you.

&lt;p name=&quot;9f72&quot; id=&quot;9f72&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;While we are very grateful for our successes, they have created a lot of capacity challenges for us as a business. To put it in perspective, we do more sales in &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;six&lt;/em&gt; days a week than our competitors do in &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;seven&lt;/em&gt; (we are closed on Sunday). Many of our restaurants are doing greater than &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;three times&lt;/strong&gt; the volume that they were initially designed for. These are great problems to have, but they create some extremely difficult challenges related to scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5be3&quot; id=&quot;5be3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;At Chick-fil-A, we believe the solutions to many of these capacity problems are &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;technology&lt;/em&gt; solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;230a&quot; id=&quot;230a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;A new generation of workloads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b864&quot; id=&quot;b864&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;One of our approaches to solving these problems is to invest in a smarter restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3f27&quot; id=&quot;3f27&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Our goal: simplify the restaurant experience for Owner/Operators and their teams and optimize for great, hot, tasty, food served quickly and with a personal touch, all while increasing the capacity of our existing footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;36d8&quot; id=&quot;36d8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Our hypothesis: By making smarter kitchen equipment we can collect more data. By applying data to our restaurant, we can build more intelligent systems. By building more intelligent systems, we can better scale our business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;83bf&quot; id=&quot;83bf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As a simple example, image a forecasting model that attempts to predict how many Waffle Fries (or replace with your favorite Chick-fil-A product) should be cooked over every minute of the day. The forecast is created by an analytics process running in the cloud that uses transaction-level sales data from many restaurants. This forecast can most certainly be produced with a little work. Unfortunately, it is not accurate enough to actually drive food production. Sales in Chick-fil-A restaurants are prone to many traffic spikes and are significantly affected by local events (traffic, sports, weather, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e927&quot; id=&quot;e927&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;However, if we were to collect data from our point-of-sale system’s keystrokes in real-time to understand current demand, add data from the fryers about work in progress inventory, and then micro-adjust the initial forecast in-restaurant, we would be able to get a much more accurate picture of what we should cook at any given moment. This data can then be used to give a much more intelligent display to a restaurant team member that is responsible for cooking fries (for example), or perhaps to drive cooking automation in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2bb8&quot; id=&quot;2bb8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Goals like this led us to develop an Internet of Things (IOT) platform for our restaurants. To successfully scale our business we need the ability to 1) collect data and 2) use it to drive automation in the restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3f19&quot; id=&quot;3f19&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Rather than select many different vendor solutions that were silo’d and disconnected and therefore difficult to integrate, we wanted an &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;open ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt; that we own. This approach enables us to allow internal developers and/or external partners to develop connected “things” or applications for the Edge and leverage our platform for common needs like security, identity, and connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5f5d&quot; id=&quot;5f5d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Put another way, the IOT/Edge team owns a small subset of the overall application base that is deployed on the edge, and is effectively a runtime platform team for the in-restaurant compute platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;f008&quot; id=&quot;f008&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Architecture Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f43b&quot; id=&quot;f43b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Here is a look at the architecture we developed (and are using today) to meet these goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*R6_1n9WyVBEORH2tNZhg_g.png&quot; data-width=&quot;2836&quot; data-height=&quot;1280&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*R6_1n9WyVBEORH2tNZhg_g.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*R6_1n9WyVBEORH2tNZhg_g.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 name=&quot;1d2c&quot; id=&quot;1d2c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Cloud Control Plane&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5f96&quot; id=&quot;5f96&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Today, we run our higher order control plane and core IoT services in the cloud. This includes services like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;b0fa&quot; id=&quot;b0fa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Authorization Server — device identity management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;7af1&quot; id=&quot;7af1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Data ingest / routing — collect data and send it where it needs to go&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;a627&quot; id=&quot;a627&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Operational time series data — logs, monitoring, alerting, tracing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;ea44&quot; id=&quot;ea44&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Deployment management — self-service deployment for our application teams using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weave.works/blog/gitops-operations-by-pull-request&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.weave.works/blog/gitops-operations-by-pull-request&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GitOps&lt;/a&gt; (kudos to our friends at Weaveworks for sharing the term). We plan to share our work and code soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;12c5&quot; id=&quot;12c5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;These services also run in Kubernetes so that we have a common paradigm across all of our team’s deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;678d&quot; id=&quot;678d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Edge&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5190&quot; id=&quot;5190&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;“Edge Computing” is the idea of &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;putting compute resources close to the action to attain a higher level of availability and/or lower level of latency.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2872&quot; id=&quot;2872&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We think of our Edge Computing environment as a “micro private cloud”. By this, we mean that we provide developers with a series of helpful services and a place to deploy their applications on our infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1e43&quot; id=&quot;1e43&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Does this make us the largest “cloud provider” in the world? You can be the judge of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*IDbfSWxAnROTOiJ5j-2hgg.png&quot; data-width=&quot;2690&quot; data-height=&quot;1300&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*IDbfSWxAnROTOiJ5j-2hgg.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*IDbfSWxAnROTOiJ5j-2hgg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bfa1&quot; id=&quot;bfa1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;In all seriousness, this approach gives us a unique kind of scale. Rather than a few large K8s clusters with &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;tens-to-hundreds-of-thousands&lt;/em&gt; of containers, at full scale we will have more than 2000 clusters with &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;tens of containers&lt;/em&gt; per cluster. And that number grows significantly as we open many new restaurants every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f1db&quot; id=&quot;f1db&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Our edge workloads include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;66ce&quot; id=&quot;66ce&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;platform services such as an authentication token service, pub/sub messaging (MQTT), log collection/exfiltration (&lt;a href=&quot;https://fluentbit.io/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://fluentbit.io/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FluentBit&lt;/a&gt;), monitoring (&lt;a href=&quot;https://prometheus.io/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://prometheus.io/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt;), etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;00c3&quot; id=&quot;00c3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;applications that interact with “things” in the restaurant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;d29d&quot; id=&quot;d29d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;simple microservices that serve HTTP requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;42a2&quot; id=&quot;42a2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;machine learning models that synthesize cloud-developed forecasts with real-time events from MQTT to make decisions at the edge and drive automation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;436b&quot; id=&quot;436b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Our physical edge environment obtains it’s connectivity from multiple in-restaurant switches (and two routers), so we operate on a very highly available LAN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;87bc&quot; id=&quot;87bc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Today, nearly all of the data that is collected at the Edge is ephemeral and only needs to exist for a short time before being exfiltrated to the cloud. This could change in the future, but it has kept our early-stage deployments very simple and made them much easier to manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0139&quot; id=&quot;0139&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Since we have a highly available Kubernetes cluster with data replicated across all nodes, we can ensure that we can retain any data that is collected until a time when the internet is again available for data exfiltration. We can also aggregate, compress, or drop data dynamically at the Edge based on business need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;44a1&quot; id=&quot;44a1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Given all of this, we still use the &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;cloud&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;first&lt;/strong&gt; for our services whenever possible. Edge is the fallback deployment target when high-availability, low-latency, in-restaurant applications are a must.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;f925&quot; id=&quot;f925&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Following in the footsteps of giants&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1fd1&quot; id=&quot;1fd1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;We run our Edge infrastructure on commodity hardware that costs us, &lt;a href=&quot;https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/28310/origin-of-ballpark-estimate-to-mean-a-very-rough-estimate&quot; data-href=&quot;https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/28310/origin-of-ballpark-estimate-to-mean-a-very-rough-estimate&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;ballpark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; $1000/restaurant. We wanted to keep our hardware investment low-cost and horizontally scalable. We have not found a way to make it dynamic/elastic yet, but maybe one day (order on Amazon w/ free 30-second shipping perhaps?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2964&quot; id=&quot;2964&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;With our architecture, we can add additional compute capacity as-needed by adding additional devices. We may upsize our hardware footprint in the future, but what we have makes sense for our workloads today. Google also got started scaling workloads on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcworld.com/article/112891/article.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.pcworld.com/article/112891/article.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;commodity hardware&lt;/a&gt; (written in 2003, where has the time gone?)… so we’re in good company!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5788&quot; id=&quot;5788&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We hope our approach to Edge infrastructure encourages creative thinking for anyone that is working with scarce resources (physical space, budget, or otherwise). I think that’s &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;614b&quot; id=&quot;614b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Everything else&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6134&quot; id=&quot;6134&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Finally, we have our connectivity layer and the IOT things. Many of our devices are fully-powered (no batteries) but still constrained on chipsets/processing power. Wi-Fi is the default method for connectivity. We have not committed to a low-power protocol yet, but are interested in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LoRa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11ah&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11ah&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WiFi Halo (802.11ah)&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bba8&quot; id=&quot;bba8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For things/physical devices, our team also provides developers with an SDK for executing on-boarding flows (all OAuth based) and for accessing services within the Edge environment such as MQTT. Brian talked about this more extensively at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infoq.com/presentations/chickfila-iot&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.infoq.com/presentations/chickfila-iot&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;QConNY 2017&lt;/a&gt; (note that we were using Docker Swarm vs. Kubernetes at the time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;3060&quot; id=&quot;3060&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Containers at the Edge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;80ac&quot; id=&quot;80ac&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Why would you want to run containers at the Edge? For the same reason you would run them in the cloud (or anywhere else).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1a21&quot; id=&quot;1a21&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Dependency management becomes easier. Testing is easier. The developer experience is easier and better. Teams can move much faster and more autonomously, especially when reasonable points of abstraction (such as k8s namespaces) and resource limits (CPU/RAM) are applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f1ef&quot; id=&quot;f1ef&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Another key design goal was reliability for our critical applications, meaning no single points-of-failure in the architecture. There are many ways this type of goal can be achieved, but we decided having &amp;gt; 1 physical hosts at the Edge and a container-based orchestration layer was the best approach for the types of workloads we have and for the skillset of our teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bf35&quot; id=&quot;bf35&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We initially called our strategy “Redundant Restaurant Compute”, which really speaks to the goal behind our approach. Later, we transitioned to calling it “Edge Computing”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;dbb8&quot; id=&quot;dbb8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The ability to orchestrate services effectively and to preserve a desired number of replicas quickly and consistently attracted us to Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;3b59&quot; id=&quot;3b59&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Why Kubernetes?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5d6f&quot; id=&quot;5d6f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;At first, we planned to use Docker Swarm for container orchestration, but made the move to Kubernetes in early 2018 because we believe it’s core capabilities and surrounding ecosystem are (by far) the strongest. We are excited about taking advantage of some of the developments around Kubernetes like &lt;a href=&quot;https://istio.io/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://istio.io/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Istio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openfaas/faas&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/openfaas/faas&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OpenFaaS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c6e3&quot; id=&quot;c6e3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Most importantly, we firmly believe…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8c4f&quot; id=&quot;8c4f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Ideas, in and of themselves, have no value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;dc59&quot; id=&quot;dc59&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Code, in and of itself, has no value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9e9f&quot; id=&quot;9e9f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The only thing that has value is code &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;that is running in production&lt;/em&gt;. Only then have you created value for users and had the opportunity to impact your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*Q68UZ5maIWMdAAGW_Tyrgw.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1464&quot; data-height=&quot;658&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*Q68UZ5maIWMdAAGW_Tyrgw.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*Q68UZ5maIWMdAAGW_Tyrgw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ec82&quot; id=&quot;ec82&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Therefore, at Chick-fil-A, we want to optimize for taking great ideas, turning them into code, and getting that code running in production &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;as fast as possible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2337&quot; id=&quot;2337&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations-ebook/dp/B07B9F83WM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1531455879&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=accelerate&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations-ebook/dp/B07B9F83WM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1531455879&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=accelerate&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; says that using the latest and greatest technology (like Kubernetes) has no correlation to a team or organization’s success. None. The ability to turn ideas into code and get code into production rapidly does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b559&quot; id=&quot;b559&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If you can accomplish this goal and meet your requirements with VMWare, a single machine, some other clustering tool or orchestration layer, or using just the cloud, we would not try and convince you to switch to Kubernetes and follow our lead. The simplest possible solution is &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; the best solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7e56&quot; id=&quot;7e56&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;At Chick-fil-A, we believe that the best way for &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;us&lt;/strong&gt; to achieve these goals is for us to embrace containerization, and to do so with Kubernetes. At the end of the day, its all there to help you “Eat More Chicken”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;743b&quot; id=&quot;743b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Next&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8233&quot; id=&quot;8233&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;What are our next steps?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;596a&quot; id=&quot;596a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In the next 18-24 months, we expect to increase the number of smart/connected devices in our restaurants to &amp;gt; 100,000 and complete our chain-wide rollout of Kubernetes to the Edge. The number of use cases for “brain applications” that control the restaurant from the edge continue to grow, and we look forward to serving them and sharing more with the community about what we learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c7ee&quot; id=&quot;c7ee&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We will also take a close look at the Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/gke-on-prem/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/gke-on-prem/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GKE On-Prem&lt;/a&gt; service that was just announced since it might save us from building and managing clusters in the future. What we have done to-date is a sunk cost, and if we can re-focus resources on the differentiating rather than infrastructure, you can be certain we will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;555d&quot; id=&quot;555d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;If we failed to answer questions you have about what we’re doing, don’t hesitate to reach out on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-chambers/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-chambers/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;. If we can help you with any challenges with Kubernetes at the Edge, please let us know. At Chick-fil-A, it is always our please to share, and (kudos to Caleb for this) “our pleasure to server you”.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Redis will remain BSD licensed</title>
<link>http://antirez.com/news/120</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://antirez.com/news/120</guid>
<description>&lt;section id=&quot;newslist&quot;&gt;&lt;article data-news-id=&quot;120&quot;&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;article class=&quot;comment&quot; data-comment-id=&quot;120-&quot; id=&quot;120-&quot; readability=&quot;9.9731492136555&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;info&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;username&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://antirez.com/user/antirez&quot;&gt;antirez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 18 hours ago. 36464 views.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Today a page about the new Common Clause license in the Redis Labs web site was interpreted as if Redis itself switched license. This is not the case, Redis is, and will remain, BSD licensed. However in the era of [edit] uncontrollable spreading of information, my attempts to provide the correct information failed, and I’m still seeing everywhere “Redis is no longer open source”. The reality is that Redis remains BSD, and actually Redis Labs did the right thing supporting my effort to keep the Redis core open as usually.

What is happening instead is that certain Redis modules, developed inside Redis Labs, are now released under the Common Clause (using Apache license as a base license). This means that basically certain enterprise add-ons, instead of being completely closed source as they could be, will be available with a more permissive license.

I think that Redis Labs Common Clause page did not provide a clear and complete information, but software companies often make communication errors, it happens. To me however, it looks more important that while running a system software business in the “cloud era” (LOL) is very challenging using an open source license, yet Redis Labs totally understood and supported the idea that the Redis core is an open source project, in the *most permissive license ever*, that is, BSD, and during the years provided a lot of funding to the project.

The reason why certain modules developed internally at Redis Labs are switching license, is because they are added value that Redis Labs wants to be able to provide only to end users that are willing to compile and install the system themselves, or to the Redis Labs customers using their services. But it’s not ok to give away that value to everybody willing to resell it. An example of such module is RediSearch: it was AGPL and is now going to be Apache + Common Clause.

About myself, I’ll keep writing BSD code for Redis. For Redis modules I’ll develop, such as Disque, I’ll pick AGPL instead, for similar reasons: we live in a “Cloud-poly”, so it’s a good idea to go forward with licenses that will force other SaaS companies to redistribute back their improvements. However this does not apply to Redis itself. Redis at this point is a 10 years collective effort, the base for many other things that we can do together, and this base must be as available as possible, that is, BSD licensed.

We at Redis Labs are sorry for the confusion generated by the Creative Common page, and my colleagues are working to fix the page with better wording.

<title>The Commons Clause is an existential threat to open source</title>
<link>https://drewdevault.com/2018/08/22/Commons-clause-will-destroy-open-source.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://drewdevault.com/2018/08/22/Commons-clause-will-destroy-open-source.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;An alarmist title, I know, but it’s true. If the &lt;a href=&quot;https://commonsclause.com/&quot;&gt;Commons clause&lt;/a&gt; were to be adopted by all open source projects, they would cease to be open source&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;/&gt;, and therefore the Commons clause is trying to destroy open source. When this first appeared I spoke out about it in discussion threads around the net, but didn’t think anyone would take it seriously. Well, yesterday, some parts of Redis &lt;a href=&quot;https://redislabs.com/community/commons-clause/&quot;&gt;became proprietary software&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commons Clause promoted by Kevin Wang presents one of the greatest existential threats to open source I’ve ever seen. It preys on a vulnerability open source maintainers all suffer from, and one I can strongly relate to. It &lt;em&gt;sucks&lt;/em&gt; to not be able to make money from your open source work. It &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; sucks when companies are using your work to make money for themselves. If a solution presents itself, it’s tempting to jump at it. But the Commons Clause doesn’t present a solution for supporting open source software. It presents a framework for turning open source software into proprietary software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What should we do about open source maintainers not getting the funding they need? It’s a very real problem, and one Kevin has &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kevinverse/status/1032074268291424257&quot;&gt;explicitly asked us&lt;/a&gt; to talk about before we criticise his solution to it. I would be happy to share my thoughts. I’ve struggled for many years to find a way to finance myself as the maintainer of many dozens of projects. For a long time it has been a demotivating struggle with no clear solutions, a struggle which at one point probably left me vulnerable to the temptations offered by the Common Clause. But today, the situation is clearly improving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I have a harder go of it because very little of my open source software is appealing to the businesses that have the budget to sponsor them. Instead, I rely on the (much smaller and less stable) recurring donations of my individual users. When I started accepting these, I did not think that it was going to work out. But today, I’m making far more money from these donations than I ever thought possible&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;/&gt;, and I see an upwards trend which will eventually lead me to being able to work on open source full time. If I were able to add only a few business-level sponsorships to this equation, I think I would easily have already reached my goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other options for securing financing for open source, some of which Redis has already been exploring. Selling a hosted and supported version of your service is often a good call. Offering consulting support for your software has also worked for many groups in the past. Some projects succeed with (A)GPL for everyone and BSD for a price. These are all better avenues to explore - making your software proprietary is a tragic alternative that should not be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to combine these methods with a greater appreciation for open source in the business community. Businesses need engineers - appeal to your peers so they can appeal to the money on behalf of the projects they depend on. A $250/mo recurring donation to would be a drop in the bucket of most businesses, but a major boon to any open source project, with which the business will almost certainly see tangible value-add as a result. When I get to work today I’m going to identify open source projects we use that accept donations and make the plea&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;/&gt;, and keep making the plea week over week until money is spent. You should, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redis also stands out as a cautionary entry in the history of Contributor License Agreements. Everyone who has contributed to the now-proprietary Redis modules has had their hard work stolen and sold by RedisLabs under a proprietary license. I do not sign CLAs and I think they’re a harmful practice for this very reason. Asking a contributor to sign them is a slap in the face to the good will which led them to make a contribution in the first place. Don’t sign these and don’t ask others to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I respect antirez&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;/&gt; very much, but I am sorely disappointed in him. He should have known better and, if you’re reading this, I urge you to roll back your misguided decision. But the Commons Clause is much more deeply disturbing. What Kevin is doing will ruin open source software, maybe for good&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really appreciate some of Kevin’s work. &lt;a href=&quot;https://fossa.io/&quot;&gt;FOSSA&lt;/a&gt; is a really cool tool that can stand to provide some serious value to the open source community. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tldrlegal.com/&quot;&gt;TL;DR Legal&lt;/a&gt; is a fantastic tool which has already delivered a tremendous amount of value to open source, and I’ve personally referenced it dozens of times. Thank you, honestly, for your work on improving the legal landscape of open source. With Commons Clause, however, Kevin has taken it too far. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html&quot;&gt;The four freedoms&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;em&gt;important&lt;/em&gt;. The only solution is to bury the Common Clause project. Kill the website and GitHub repository, and we can try to forget this ever happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand that turning back is going to be hard, which scares me. I know that Kevin has already put a lot of effort into it and convinced himself that it’s the Right Thing To Do. It takes work to write the clause, vet it for legal issues, design a website (a beautiful one, I’ll give you that), and to promote it among your target audience. I know how hard it is to distance yourself from something you’ve staked your personal reputation on. You had only the best intentions&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot;/&gt;, Kevin, but please step back from the ego and do the right thing - take this down. You stand to undo all of your hard work for the open source community in one fell swoop with this initiative. I’m begging you, stop while it’s not too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man, two angry articles in a row. I have more technical articles coming up, I promise.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>The Commons Clause will destroy open source</og:title>
<og:description>An alarmist title, I know, but it’s true. If the Commons clause were to be adopted by all open source projects, they would cease to be open source1, and therefore the Commons clause is trying to destroy open source. When this first appeared I spoke out about it in discussion threads around the net, but didn’t think anyone would take it seriously. Well, yesterday, some parts of Redis became proprietary software. Under both the OSI and FSF definitions. The Commons Clause removes freedom 0 of the four essential freedoms. ↩</og:description>

<title>Need More Self-Control? Try a Simple Ritual</title>
<link>https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/need-more-self-control-try-a-simple-ritual/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/need-more-self-control-try-a-simple-ritual/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region mura-region-loose&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region-local&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of our most vexing problems, from overeating to not saving enough for retirement to not working out enough have something in common: lack of self-control. Self-control is what gives us the capacity to say no to choices that are immediately gratifying but costly in the long term—that a piece of chocolate cake (instead of an apple), that afternoon in front of the couch (instead of a visit to the gym). Despite our best intentions, we often fail to meet our lofty goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem of self-control has puzzled psychologists and behavioral scientists for decades. A great deal of research has identified situations in which self-control failures are likely to happen and tools to help people exercise better control. For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7e62/d332cbdbbdafe0d69778dc92ca4868d7c7df.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has found that people persist for longer on tasks that require self-control when they know they’ll be paid for their efforts, or when they are told that their work will benefit others (such as helping find a cure for Alzheimer’s disease). These motivating incentives can increase our self-control, at least up to a point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs have also become interested in self-control, as is evident from the many diet and exercise apps and gadgets on the market. To take one notable example, on the commitment contract website stickK.com, users put down some money (say, $200) and state a goal they want to achieve (such as to lose ten pounds in a month). They also need to state what will happen to the money if they don’t stick to their commitments (e.g., it’ll go to a friend or to a charity they do not like). If they meet their goal, they earn their money back. If they don’t, they lose the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tools like stickK.com can be effective, but they are often difficult to implement; you may need to enlist someone to help monitor your efforts. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29771567&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New research&lt;/a&gt; my colleagues and I conducted point to a different solution that may be easier to implement: using rituals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rituals are series of steps we take while attaching some kind of symbolic meaning. Players in all sorts of sports have rituals that involve actions such as eating the same foods in exactly the same order before a game or listening to the same pre-ordered play list a given number of times. From the way some prepare their coffee to the way people celebrate important life events, like weddings or graduations, rituals are a part of our daily life. And though they may seem useless, or even silly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-rituals-work/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has found that rituals are powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, my colleagues and I have found that rituals &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/Rituals%20OBHDP_5cbc5848-ef4d-4192-a320-68d30169763c.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reduce anxiety before stressful tasks, and improve performance&lt;/a&gt;. They allow us &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/688495?journalCode=jacr&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;to enjoy our family holidays more&lt;/a&gt;. And they also &lt;a href=&quot;https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/10683152/norton%20gino_rituals-and-grief.pdf?sequence=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;give us a greater sense of control after experiencing a loss&lt;/a&gt;, whether a loved one or in a lottery. Given the power of rituals, we thought we might test their effectiveness in resisting temptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29771567&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;, we tested the power of rituals to help with a common self-control problem: eating less. We visited a university gym and recruited undergraduate females who already had a goal of losing weight. We told half of them to be mindful about their food consumption for the next five days. We taught the other half a three-step pre-eating ritual and told them to complete it every time they ate something. The ritual, which we created rather randomly, did not require participants to eat less food and did not directly interfere with consumption. Here’s the ritual:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First, cut your food into pieces before you eat it. Second, rearrange the pieces so that they are perfectly symmetric on your plate. That is, get the right half of your plate to look exactly the same as the left half of your plate. Finally, press your eating utensil against the top of your food three times. In order to be in the study, you must do the three steps of this ritual each time you eat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To track daily food and beverage intake, we asked participant to download the “MyFitnessPal” food-tracking app onto their phone. MyFitnessPal allows users to list exactly the type and amount of food or beverage they consume, including brands of grocery products and meals from chain restaurants. Three times per day, participants’ phone would remind them to log their food intake, and the experimenter had access to these online food diaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we expected, participants who enacted the pre-eating ritual consumed fewer calories (about 1,424 calories for each day, on average) as compared to those who simply were mindful about their eating (who consumed about 1,648). Those who performed the ritual also ate less fat and less sugar. The ritual helped them exercise the self-control needed to achieve their weight loss goals. Interestingly, at the end of the study, our participants said they thought the ritual was not very helpful and reported they were unlikely to continue it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29771567&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt;, we examined whether simple rituals could also help people make healthier choices when tempted with unhealthy ones. We invited college students to the laboratory and told them they would complete a taste test of carrots and chocolate. They received four bags from the experimenter: three that each contained one baby carrot, and a fourth that contained a Lindt chocolate truffle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We divided participants in three groups: those engaging in a ritual, those making random gestures (all polite ones!), and those who simply ate carrots (our control condition). Those in our ritual condition were given a series of steps to perform before eating each carrot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make a fist with your right hand. Using your knuckles, knock on the table twice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now, take out the first [second] [third] plastic bag and put it in front of you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then, use your right hand and knock twice again on the table.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now, take a deep breath and close your eyes for two seconds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before they ate the third carrots, they answered two questions about eating the third carrot and finally learned they had a choice between eating the third carrot or a chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those in our random-gestures condition completed a different set of steps before eating each carrot; they too were given a choice between eating the carrot (the healthy option) or the chocolate (the tempting, unhealthy one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the third subgroup (the control condition), participants simply ate the first two carrots, answered the same two questions, and were given the final choice without performing any additional steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 58% of the participants in our ritual condition chose the carrot over the chocolate, as compared to only about 35% of those in the control condition and 46% of those in the random-gestures condition. Thus, participants who enacted a ritual while eating carrots subsequently made healthier choices as compared to those in the other groups. The results suggest that following a stringent set of steps, however strange, before eating may be a better weight-loss strategy than adhering to a stringent diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that rituals like the ones we created and used in our research can be taken too far. When a repeated set of actions that restrict food consumption start to become mindlessly followed, as by habit, they can lead to problematic behaviors such as eating disorders, &lt;a href=&quot;https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.scientificamerican.com_article_disrupting-2Dthe-2Dhabits-2Dof-2Danorexia_&amp;amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;amp;c=vh6FgFnduejNhPPD0fl_yRaSfZy8CWbWnIf4XJhSqx8&amp;amp;r=3XsFOJ1tB21udKJUeBHR0XB_fcoLgUfFfniAbkmYxkw&amp;amp;m=VmJ-srKqyvXm_Mk105Or6iuC4HAq3uVTf8Oi1Ohdbzs&amp;amp;s=5Xf-u4L_pbCcGw7HuofMJMsx6sFzgh875bdBtg7PQy0&amp;amp;e=&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; finds. But undertaken conscientiously and carefully, such practices can also promote wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychology research has found that our behaviors lead us to conclusions about ourselves: donating money to the homeless causes us to view ourselves as caring, and giving up our seat on the subway leads us to believe we’re polite, for instance. Following a series of steps over and over again, which happens when we use rituals, requires some good self-discipline. So, we reasoned, when we see ourselves engaging in a ritual, we code that behavior as a sign that we are people with self-control. And thanks to that self-control, we choose the apple (or carrot) over the chocolate and thus reduce our caloric intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classical Confucian philosophy places a lot of emphasis on ritual. It may be no surprise, then that, evidence suggests that East Asians from highly ritualized Confucian cultures have stronger self-regulation skills than people from Western cultures. Likewise, the military lifestyle across cultures is known to induce both self-discipline and behavioral regulation, perhaps in part due to its many rituals, including marching, chanting, and other regimented behaviors, that ensure order and high levels of motivation. At the outset, these rituals may seem like a waste of time. Yet, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29771567&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;our research&lt;/a&gt; suggests, they are quite powerful. Even when they are not embedded in years of tradition, simple rituals can help us build personal discipline and self-control. With a simple ritual, that piece of chocolate cake may not look as tempting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>A visualization of the prime factors of the first million integers</title>
<link>https://johnhw.github.io/umap_primes/index.md.html</link>

<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;/&gt;&lt;title/&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;77&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;# What do numbers look like? ![One million integers embedded into 2D space with UMAP](primes_umap_1e6_contrast_enhanced.png) This is the first million integers, represented as binary vectors indicating their prime factors, and laid out using the [UMAP dimensionality reduction algorithm](https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap) by Leland Mcinnes. Each integer is represented in a high-dimensional space, and gets squished down to 2D so that numbers with similar prime factorisations are closer together than those with dissimilar factorisations. A very pretty structure emerges; this might be spurious in that it captures more about the layout algorithm than any *&quot;true&quot;* structure of numbers. However, the visual effect is very appealling and requires no tricky manipulation to create. [Large 4k version of the image suitable for backgrounds](primes_umap_1e6_4k.png) ## Video A short video, showing the numbers being added in sequence. Each frame adds 1000 integers, for a total of 1000 frames. &lt;iframe width=&quot;726&quot; height=&quot;408&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nCk8dyU7zUM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt; ## 3D view There is a WebGL live in-browser [3D viewer here](https://johnhw.github.io/umap_primes/three_umap.html). The algorithm was run again compressing into a 3D space, instead of 2D. Much of the structure remains stable, which is very pleasing. This plot uses the &quot;false colouring&quot; to colour the points, as explained in below. ## Representation Each integer is represented as a vector, one element for each possible prime factor, where 0=prime factor not present, 1=prime factor present. This provides a simple geometry for the integers, where each number can be seen as being composed of prime basis vectors. For example, 10 might be represented as `[1 0 1 0 0 0 0 ...]` as it has factors 2 and 5 (the first and third primes respectively). These high-dimensional vectors are then squashed down from thousands of dimensions for each number to just two dimensions, and a point plotted at that coordinate. The points are coloured according to the original integer index; brighter colours correspond to larger numbers. The points are laid out so that numbers with similar &quot;angles&quot; to each other are close together. For example, all primes are at 90 degrees to each other, and all powers of a number are identical to each other (0 degree angle). ### Algorithm * for each `i` up to `n` * find prime factors of `i`. * For each `i`, make binary vector with [`π(n)`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime-counting_function) columns (π(n) = number of primes less than `n`), where each element has `1`=prime factor present, `0`=absent. * Stack all vectors into a large, sparse matrix * Lay out with UMAP, using the cosine distance function (dot product). I used [`li(n)`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_integral_function) as a cheap upper bound on `π(n)` to estimate the number of columns needed. For example, for `n=11`, the matrix looks like: ``` 2 3 5 7 11 [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.] 0 [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.] 1 [1. 0. 0. 0. 0.] 2 [0. 1. 0. 0. 0.] 3 [1. 0. 0. 0. 0.] 4 [0. 0. 1. 0. 0.] 5 [1. 1. 0. 0. 0.] 6 [0. 0. 0. 1. 0.] 7 [1. 0. 0. 0. 0.] 8 [0. 1. 0. 0. 0.] 9 [1. 0. 1. 0. 0.] 10 [0. 0. 0. 0. 1.] 11 ``` The image above is reduced from a 1000000x78628 (!) binary matrix to 1000000x2. This only works because of the excellent sparse matrix support in UMAP. ### What are we seeing? The points can be filtered according to whatever criteria we might be interested in. For example, the parity of the numbers (even=green, odd=orange) ![Coloured by parity of the points](primes_even_odd_4k_crop.png) or alternatively by the whether the points are prime or not (white=prime, blue=composite). ![Coloured by primeness of the points](is_prime_1k.png) As might be expected, the primes form the vague, diffuse cluster near the centre, as they are all orthogonal to each other. Extending this idea, we can colour the points by number of unique factors: ![Coloured by number of unique factors](primes_colored_1k.png) We can colour the points according to the prime factors they contain, where the log of the factor is mapped to hue, with redder=smaller, bluer=larger factor. This generalises the parity plot above. This plot has just a touch of spatial noise added to try and separate out the colours more clearly, as each factor pass is rendered as a separate layer. ![Coloured by factors present, hue mapped to prime factor](primes_mod_multispectral_4k_crop.png) #### Sequences We can look at where common sequences of numbers lie. This isn't particularly informative, but there is perhaps some pattern. For example, the Fibonacci sequence: ![Fibonacci sequence numbers marked in yellow](primes_A000045.png) or the squares: ![Squares marked in yellow](primes_A000290.png) #### The frontier It's worth noting that any structure that is not an algorithmic artificat is really the **frontier** of numbers at some threshold (in this case, 1 million). *Every* possible finite binary vector corresponds to at least one integer in this representation (actually, infinitely many, as all repeated factors are contracted onto a single binary indicator). Therefore, in the infinite set of integers, all points are present, at every possible angle or distance from each other, and the space would be perfectly evenly filled. However, by cutting off at some specific `n`, we see the &quot;surface&quot; that we have reached by composing together primes such that their product is less than `n`. ### Code The [python code is available](https://gist.github.com/johnhw/dfc7b8b8519aac530ac97da226c17bd5).

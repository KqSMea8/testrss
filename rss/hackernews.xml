<title>Inside China’s Dystopian Dreams: A.I., Shame and Lots of Cameras</title>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;40.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;26&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;ZHENGZHOU, China — In the Chinese city of Zhengzhou, a police officer wearing facial recognition glasses spotted a heroin smuggler at a train station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In Qingdao, a city famous for its German colonial heritage, cameras powered by artificial intelligence helped the police snatch two dozen criminal suspects in the midst of a big annual beer festival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In Wuhu, a fugitive murder suspect was identified by a camera as he bought food from a street vendor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;With millions of cameras and billions of lines of code, China is building a high-tech authoritarian future. Beijing is embracing technologies like facial recognition and artificial intelligence to identify and track 1.4 billion people. It wants to assemble a vast and unprecedented national surveillance system, with crucial help from its thriving technology industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“In the past, it was all about instinct,” said Shan Jun, the deputy chief of the police at the railway station in Zhengzhou, where the heroin smuggler was caught. “If you missed something, you missed it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;China is reversing the commonly held vision of technology as a great democratizer, bringing people more freedom and connecting them to the world. In China, it has brought control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In some cities, cameras scan train stations for China’s most wanted. Billboard-size displays show the faces of jaywalkers and list the names of people who can’t pay their debts. Facial recognition scanners guard the entrances to housing complexes. Already, China has an estimated 200 million surveillance cameras — four times as many as the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Such efforts supplement other systems that track internet use and communications, hotel stays, train and plane trips and even car travel in some places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;44&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Even so, China’s ambitions outstrip its abilities. Technology in place at one train station or crosswalk may be lacking in another city, or even the next block over. Bureaucratic inefficiencies prevent the creation of a nationwide network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;For the Communist Party, that may not matter. Far from hiding their efforts, Chinese authorities regularly state, and overstate, their capabilities. In China, even the perception of surveillance can keep the public in line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Some places are further along than others. Invasive mass-surveillance software has been set up in the west to track members of the Uighur Muslim minority and map their relations with friends and family, according to software viewed by The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“This is potentially a totally new way for the government to manage the economy and society,” said Martin Chorzempa, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“The goal is algorithmic governance,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;36.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1caa3mc eqpy7av0&quot;&gt;The Shame Game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The intersection south of Changhong Bridge in the city of Xiangyang used to be a nightmare. Cars drove fast and jaywalkers darted into the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Then last summer, the police put up cameras linked to facial recognition technology and a big, outdoor screen. Photos of lawbreakers were displayed alongside their names and government I.D. numbers. People were initially excited to see their faces on the board, said Guan Yue, a spokeswoman, until propaganda outlets told them it was punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;43.256529850746&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;31.820895522388&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“If you are captured by the system and you don’t see it, your neighbors or colleagues will, and they will gossip about it,” she said. “That’s too embarrassing for people to take.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;China’s new surveillance is based on an old idea: Only strong authority can bring order to a turbulent country. Mao Zedong took that philosophy to devastating ends, as his top-down rule brought &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/06/world/asia/06iht-letter06.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;famine&lt;/a&gt; and then the Cultural Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;His successors also craved order but feared the consequences of totalitarian rule. They formed a new understanding with the Chinese people. In exchange for political impotence, they would be mostly left alone and allowed to get rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;It worked. Censorship and police powers remained strong, but China’s people still found more freedom. That new attitude helped usher in decades of breakneck economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Today, that unwritten agreement is breaking down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;China’s economy isn’t growing at the same pace. It suffers from a severe wealth gap. After four decades of fatter paychecks and better living, its people have higher expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, has moved to solidify his power. Changes to Chinese law mean he could rule longer than any leader since Mao. And he has undertaken a broad corruption crackdown that could make him plenty of enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;49.665956313266&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;45.240277037826&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;For support, he has turned to the Mao-era beliefs in the importance of a cult of personality and the role of the Communist Party in everyday life. Technology gives him the power to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Reform and opening has already failed, but no one dares to say it,” said Chinese historian Zhang Lifan, citing China’s four-decade post-Mao policy. “The current system has created severe social and economic segregation. So now the rulers use the taxpayers’ money to monitor the taxpayers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Xi has launched a major upgrade of the Chinese surveillance state. China has become the world’s biggest market for security and surveillance technology, with analysts estimating the country will have almost 300 million cameras installed by 2020. Chinese buyers will snap up more than three-quarters of all servers designed to scan video footage for faces, predicts IHS Markit, a research firm. China’s police will &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://politics.caijing.com.cn/20170930/4340032.shtml&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;spend an additional $30 billion&lt;/a&gt; in the coming years on techno-enabled snooping, according to one expert quoted in state media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Government contracts are fueling research and development into technologies that track faces, clothing and even a person’s gait. Experimental gadgets, like facial-recognition glasses, have begun to appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Judging public Chinese reaction can be difficult in a country where the news media is controlled by the government. Still, so far the average Chinese citizen appears to show little concern. Erratic enforcement of laws against everything from speeding to assault means the long arm of China’s authoritarian government can feel remote from everyday life. As a result, many cheer on new attempts at law and order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“It’s one of the biggest intersections in the city,” said Wang Fukang, a college student who volunteered as a guard at the crosswalk in Xiangyang. “It’s important that it stays safe and orderly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1caa3mc eqpy7av0&quot;&gt;The Surveillance Start-Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Start-ups often make a point of insisting their employees use their technology. In Shanghai, a company called Yitu has taken that to the extreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;49&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;43&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The halls of its offices are dotted with cameras, looking for faces. From desk to break room to exit, employees’ paths are traced on a television screen with blue dotted lines. The monitor shows their comings and goings, all day, everyday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In China, snooping is becoming big business. As the country spends heavily on surveillance, a new generation of start-ups have risen to meet the demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Chinese companies are developing globally competitive applications like image and voice recognition. Yitu took first place in a 2017 open contest for facial recognition algorithms held by the United States government’s Office of the Director of National Intelligence. A number of other Chinese companies also scored well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;A technology boom in China is helping the government’s surveillance ambitions. In sheer scale and investment, China already rivals Silicon Valley. Between the government and eager investors, surveillance start-ups have access to plenty of money and other resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In May, the upstart A.I. company SenseTime raised $620 million, giving it a valuation of about $4.5 billion. Yitu raised $200 million last month. Another rival, Megvii, raised $460 million from investors that included a state-backed fund created by China’s top leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;At a conference in May at an upscale hotel in Beijing, China’s security-industrial complex offered its vision of the future. Companies big and small showed off facial-recognition security gates and systems that track cars around cities to local government officials, tech executives and investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;54&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;53&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Private companies see big potential in China’s surveillance build-out. China’s public security market was valued at more than $80 billion last year but could be worth even more as the country builds its capabilities, said Shen Xinyang, a former Google data scientist who is now chief technology officer of Eyecool, a start-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Artificial intelligence for public security is actually still a very insignificant portion of the whole market,” he said, pointing out that most equipment currently in use was “nonintelligent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Many of these businesses are already providing data to the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Shen told the group that his company had surveillance systems at more than 20 airports and train stations, which had helped catch 1,000 criminals. Eyecool, he said, is also handing over two million facial images each day to a burgeoning big-data police system called Skynet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;At a building complex in Xiangyang, a facial-recognition system set up to let residents quickly through security gates adds to the police’s collection of photos of local residents, according to local Chinese Communist Party officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Wen Yangli, an executive at Number 1 Community, which makes the product, said the company is at work on other applications. One would detect when crowds of people are clashing. Another would allow police to use virtual maps of buildings to find out who lives where.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;China’s surveillance companies are also looking to test the appetite for high-tech surveillance abroad. Yitu says it has been expanding overseas, with plans to increase business in regions like Southeast Asia and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;At home, China is preparing its people for next-level surveillance technology. A recent state-media propaganda film called “Amazing China” showed off a similar virtual map that provided police with records of utility use, saying it could be used for predictive policing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“If there are anomalies, the system sends an alert,” a narrator says, as Chinese police officers pay a visit to an apartment with a record of erratic utility use. The film then quotes one of the officers: “No matter which corner you escape to, we’ll bring you to justice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;44&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1caa3mc eqpy7av0&quot;&gt;Enter the Panopticon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;For technology to be effective, it doesn’t always have to work. Take China’s facial-recognition glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Police in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou recently showed off the specs at a high-speed rail station for state media and others. They snapped photos of a policewoman peering from behind the shaded lenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But the glasses work only if the target stands still for several seconds. They have been used mostly to check travelers for fake identifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;China’s national database of individuals it has flagged for watching — including suspected terrorists, criminals, drug traffickers, political activists and others — includes 20 million to 30 million people, said one technology executive who works closely with the government. That is too many people for today’s facial recognition technology to parse, said the executive, who asked not to be identified because the information wasn’t public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The system remains more of a digital patchwork than an all-seeing technological network. Many files still aren’t digitized, and others are on mismatched spreadsheets that can’t be easily reconciled. Systems that police hope will someday be powered by A.I. are currently run by teams of people sorting through photos and data the old-fashioned way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;43.242603550296&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;31.810650887574&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Take, for example, the crosswalk in Xiangyang. The images don’t appear instantaneously. The billboard often shows jaywalkers from weeks ago, though authorities have recently reduced the lag to about five or six days. Officials said humans still sift through the images to match them to people’s identities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Still, Chinese authorities who are generally mum about security have embarked on a campaign to persuade the country’s people that the high-tech security state is already in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;China’s propagandists are fond of stories in which police use facial recognition to spot wanted criminals at events. An &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://sc.people.com.cn/n2/2018/0525/c345459-31624714.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in the People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s official newspaper, covered a series of arrests made with the aid of facial recognition at concerts of the pop star Jackie Cheung. The piece referenced some of the singer’s lyrics: “You are a boundless net of love that easily trapped me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In many places, it works. At the intersection in Xiangyang, jaywalking has decreased. At the building complex where Number 1 Community’s facial-recognition gate system has been installed, a problem with bike theft ceased entirely, according to building management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“The whole point is that people don’t know if they’re being monitored, and that uncertainty makes people more obedient,” said Mr. Chorzempa, the Peterson Institute fellow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;He described the approach as a panopticon, the idea that people will follow the rules precisely because they don’t know whether they are being watched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;41.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;28&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In Zhengzhou, police were happy to explain how just the thought of the facial recognition glasses could get criminals to confess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Shan, the Zhengzhou railway station deputy police chief, cited the time his department grabbed a heroin smuggler. While questioning the suspect, Mr. Shan said, police pulled out the glasses and told the man that what he said didn’t matter. The glasses could give them all the information they needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Because he was afraid of being found out by the advanced technology, he confessed,” said Mr. Shan, adding that the suspect had swallowed 60 small packs of heroin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“We didn’t even use any interrogation techniques,” Mr. Shan said. “He simply gave it all up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;28.282786885246&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-k8fkhk&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

<title>Having Alzheimer’s at 38 (2015)</title>

<description>&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;obin Giles felt like she was missing a joke. It was Christmas morning in 2012, and she and her husband, Joël, were going through familiar traditions in their apartment in London, Ont. Later they’d go out to visit friends and family, but for now, it was just the two of them and their cats.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They opened their stockings first, and Robin was becoming more puzzled with each object she pulled out: They were utterly random. Jo had always been a thoughtful gift-giver. One year for Christmas, he gave Robin a beautiful set of bound Paddington Bear books, a nod to her childhood favourite. He’d often come home from work with an album for her, or a treasure he found at a used bookstore. Today, though, her stocking was filled with CDs she already owned, and a used container of hand cream, as though Jo had bought a store tester. She kept thinking there was a punchline or a theme she wasn’t seeing.&lt;p&gt;She and Jo put on coffee and made cinnamon buns, but when they started opening presents, Robin’s bewilderment deepened. Jo’s gifts to her were a pile of used DVDs—titles that held no sentimental value. One was Tin Cup. “I remember thinking, ‘What the f--k? I don’t like golf or Kevin Costner,” Robin says. As she recalls this, she and Jo laugh at the memory, but, in the moment, it was deeply unsettling. “I don’t get it,” she said to Jo. “Am I missing something?” He was at a loss, unable to explain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I remember being really upset that Christmas—not because of the material stuff, but because it just felt weird,” Robin says. “It felt really weird.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something was wrong. This wasn’t Jo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That Christmas, Joël Aubin was 36 years old and already battling hard to work around an erosion process that was hard-wired into every cell of his body. He had dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s disease, the result of a genetic mutation that snakes through family trees. The disease itself is rare, and Jo is a nearly unheard-of aberration because of his age. He wouldn’t know he had the disease for another 18 months—but he’d seen it all before: His mother was 47 when she died of the same illness. Jo’s teenage world had been ripped from its frame then, but he had grown up with no idea that he had a 50/50 chance of inheriting the same fate. Alzheimer’s disease would fray his marriage before fundamentally changing it, shrink Jo’s world to the size of his neighbourhood and forge his friends and family into a tight support system. And it would lead Jo to resolve to avoid a long goodbye like his mother’s, and to choose when his story would end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dominantly inherited form of the disease is said to account for fewer than one per cent of Alzheimer’s cases—Jo’s specialist pegs it at much rarer than even that—and it’s caused by a mutation in one of three genes. While the more common type of Alzheimer’s carries a genetic risk component that means certain people are more likely to develop the disease, this genetic mutation is different: For an unlucky few like Jo, it’s a terrible guarantee. These people overproduce a protein called beta-amyloid, which accumulates in their brains as “plaques,” while another protein called tau twists itself into “tangles” inside the nerve cells. Together, they strangle neurons and eventually consume memory and ability as the brain withers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with these genetic mutations usually show symptoms around the same age as their parents. A 2012 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine traced the insidious groundwork of the disease through “biomarkers” detectable in the body long before symptoms surfaced. Twenty-five years before Jo would have noticed any major cognitive problems, the levels of amyloid in his cerebrospinal fluid would have begun to decline, as the protein began to accumulate in his brain. Jo would have been about 10 years old.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;startImage&quot; src=&quot;http://site.macleans.ca/longform/alzheimers/images/outside.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;The couple have had to learn how to live in the present&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;J&lt;/span&gt;o and Robin grew up in Kapuskasing, a remote northern Ontario town of about 8,200 people. In Grade 9, Jo met Shawn Veilleux and the two clicked instantly, becoming lifelong friends. Jo marched to his own beat, never worrying what other people thought. One weekend, a group went camping, packing little more than wieners to eat and a ridiculous quantity of beer. Jo showed up with a giant cooler stuffed with bacon, eggs, steaks, sausages—and one six-pack. “We all laughed at him. All the way to the provincial park, we laughed,” Shawn says. “It was just that Jo attitude: ‘Don’t worry about it. I know what I’m doing.’ ” By Saturday afternoon, everyone was so sick of hot dogs, they were begging to trade their beers for Jo’s food. “This guy walked out of the park probably with three cases of beer in his hands,” Shawn says. “He got us all. Everybody.” (Shawn and his wife, Chazza Currie, are good friends of mine, which is how I came to know about Robin and Jo.)&lt;p&gt;Jo had been forced to grow up quickly. By the time he started high school, his mother, Micheline, was in and out of care facilities. The genetic form of Alzheimer’s was known then, but, likely due to the limitations of small-town medicine, her illness was viewed as a puzzling mystery. Jo’s dad was consumed by his own problems, so Jo’s maternal grandmother and his teachers were his adult support system. His brother had gone off to college and returned home, but they weren’t close (Jo’s brother would turn out not to have the genetic mutation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robin, meanwhile, had grown up very close to a guy named Rylan, whose parents were friends with hers, and Rylan knew Shawn. They soon formed a tight nucleus within their larger social group. After Jo’s mom moved to a facility a 45-minute drive away from “Kap,” some combination of their foursome would go with him to visit her: a bunch of teenagers helping a friend face something that would buckle the knees of most adults. Robin was almost two years younger than the guys and, when she was in Grade 11, she and Jo started dating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 1996, when Jo was 19, his mom died. “That was a day I would never want to recreate. It was beyond hell,” he says. “That kind of impeded my faith in anything, really.” He dropped out of school and started numbing himself with alcohol and drugs. Shawn and other friends tried to talk him into going back, but it felt futile and presumptuous: How do you tell a teenager who’s just lost his mother that he needs to get his life back together? “Robin was the person who saved him,” Shawn says. “It got to the point where he was willing to go back because she was there.” In the fall of 1997, Jo, Robin, Shawn and Rylan moved to Toronto and rented a house together. Robin and Jo attended York University, both studying English and history. Their relationship was on and off in those years, but there was always a sense of coming home. “Jo and I, we just always found each other again,” Robin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By that point, a PET scan would have revealed tiny snowdrifts of amyloid accumulating in Jo’s brain. An MRI would have shown the beginnings of atrophy in his hippocampus, the region of the brain responsible for making new memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;startImage&quot; src=&quot;http://site.macleans.ca/longform/alzheimers/images/robin.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Robin Giles has had to adjust her expectations of marriage. &quot;He's still my family,&quot; she says. &quot;If your family is in trouble, you take care of them.&quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Jo and Robin moved to Halifax so he could attend teachers’ college and she could go to grad school. One night, Jo came home and started picking away at his guitar, then played Wonderful Tonight by Eric Clapton and pulled out a ring. “He was as close to Henry Rollins as I could get in real life,” Robin smiles, comparing him to the musician, writer and spoken-word artist. And all Jo ever wanted was to be a teacher and to be with Robin. “Those were the two things that always centred him in his life,” Shawn says. “Whether Robin’s in the room or not, he’ll always say, ‘I don’t know what I ever would have done without her.’ ”&lt;p&gt;Robin moved to London for teachers’ college while Jo finished in Halifax, then she landed a job at H.B. Beal Secondary School, teaching English classes and First Nations students. Jo spent a year in Kap, teaching at their old high school and living with Robin’s parents, Kip and Kathy. Then he joined Robin in London and Beal became his home base, too; he couldn’t land a permanent teaching job, but he cobbled together enough long-term placements for a full-time schedule. In June 2009, they got married. Robin’s mom made her dress, and they had a 14-person wedding party; Shawn was Jo’s best man, and Robin had her sister, Taryn, and her childhood friends, “the Kap girls,” next to her. They laughed through the whole ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Jo, teachers’ college was just walking through the door to who he’d been all along. “He didn’t want to be a teacher, he just was one,” Shawn says. The kids who needed Jo most always seemed to find him. Beal is a large high school renowned for its visual and performing arts programs; it was a natural fit for Jo, who devoured classical literature for sheer enjoyment and spoke music as his first language. His guitar was usually nearby, even at school, and he loved Pearl Jam, Bad Religion, Mumford and Sons, Black Sabbath and the Ramones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time he was 30, five years before his symptoms would announce themselves unmistakably, Jo would have shown changes in his scores over time on certain clinical-dementia-rating scales and a standard memory test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;'It's kind of like you're going through a forest, and the more you walk into the forest, the leaves get bigger and bigger and bigger, and you just become overwhelmed,' he says. 'It's just something that you can't stand.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;J&lt;/span&gt;o can’t recall when he first noticed something was wrong. The march of his illness makes it difficult now for him to tell the facts of his own story, but he can explain his emotions and experiences; he just has to work hard to make language obey him. “The first time that I realized was shocking. It was like I don’t know who I am, I don’t know what I’m saying,” Jo says now. “I don’t feel like myself because of this disease.” Sometimes the words that are available to him are one or two stops away from the words he really wants, rendering his thoughts slightly impressionistic. This is one way he describes living with dementia: “It’s kind of like you’re going through a forest and, the more you walk into the forest, the leaves get bigger and bigger and bigger, and you just become overwhelmed,” he says. “It’s just something that you can’t stand.”&lt;p&gt;After his diagnosis, Jo would tell his doctor he could remember moments in his mid-20s when he would feel momentarily disoriented while walking somewhere. And Robin can think back a decade to little things such as Jo forgetting to move the clothes to the dryer—but everyone does that once in a while. Just before that Christmas, in 2012, things changed. “At first, it was really subtle,” Robin says. “It just seemed like he couldn’t manage like he used to. He was a bit more scattered, when it came to work, which wasn’t like him.” Jo seemed withdrawn, too, his normally sociable nature giving way to someone who didn’t want to go out with friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He visited his family doctor, looking for answers. He had been diagnosed with depression and anxiety in university, and now the doctor focused on that and prescribed anti-depressants. Jo started seeing a counsellor, too. But nothing improved. Instead, the mundane little glitches started to arrive in a steady, ominous stream, and there were bigger moments that were unsettling in a way that became impossible to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 2013, Robin was helping Jo practise for interviews for the next year’s long-term teaching placements. He always did well because he was so articulate, but now he was tongue-tied, unable to explain concepts he knew thoroughly. “I remember being frustrated: ‘Come on, you’re such an awesome teacher, why can’t you just do this?’ ” Robin recalls. He came out of one interview and told her he’d blown it. “I couldn’t talk about anything,” she remembers him saying. “I don’t know what happened.” A month later, as they were both finishing up teaching summer school, Jo complained to Robin that there was something wrong with the report-card software. Robin helped him, but it didn’t make sense that he was struggling with a program he had used for years. “This isn’t normal,” Robin thought. “Something’s going on.” In August, they visited Ottawa, and Chazza and Shawn’s three-year-old son, Luke—his given names are Luke Joël Rylan, a walking tribute to those Kap friendships—suddenly asked, “Where’s Uncle Jo? That’s not my Uncle Jo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;startImage&quot; src=&quot;http://site.macleans.ca/longform/alzheimers/images/friend.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Shawn and Jo met in Grade 9; Shawn named his oldest son Luke Joél, after Jo&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;At first, Robin thought she just needed to be supportive and patient if depression was the culprit, but things only kept getting worse. She started to push Jo to insist the doctor take his problems more seriously. (The doctor did not respond to interview requests.) In September, he ordered an MRI, and told Jo the results were normal. In fact, the scan showed that the “sulci” in Jo’s brain-—the grooves in the cerebral cortex, which normally appear in cross-section like tightly folded fabric—were slightly widened, and the lateral ventricles were enlarged, revealing early atrophy. But they wouldn’t know that for months.&lt;p&gt;For Robin, the hardest thing was the change in Jo’s personality. He was usually a sunny guy, and the two of them could talk for hours about work or books or music. That was gone. And those little daily moments in which you know you are loved and part of a team because someone made coffee—it all disappeared. “When I look back, sometimes I think that was harder than when we finally got the diagnosis,” Robin says. “He was not the person I knew; he was not the person I married.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point, Jo confessed to her he was afraid that what had happened to his mom was happening to him. Robin reassured him: It can’t be that. She realizes now that part of her knew already; she couldn’t help but connect the dots between his mother’s history, the research she’d done and how much Jo had changed. But still, a louder internal voice kept insisting it had to be something fixable—a brain tumour, something more plausible than Alzheimer’s disease in her 37-year-old husband. “I think in my gut, I kind of knew, but denial is a pretty strong survival mechanism,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the 2013-14 school year went on, a chasm opened up between them. Robin is a person who gets things done, and her instinct when something is wrong is to grab it with both hands, figure out what it is and do something about it. To her, it was clear that Jo needed to see a specialist. Jo, on the other hand, is laid-back and sweet-natured, not someone inclined to demand answers. Of course, he wanted to get better, and he was taking medication and seeing a therapist, so what more did she want? Their relationship began to fray. “It was an ugly time for us,” Robin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Jo’s co-workers, it was a long while before the small, subtle lapses added up. And the “Beal family” unconsciously camouflaged problems: They simply pulled together and helped Jo, without registering how often they were holding a door and beckoning him to the classroom next to theirs, or what it meant that he needed that cue. “Sometimes, he would have a bad day, but he had lots of totally fine days, too,” says Sandy Pool, one of Robin’s closest friends on staff. “We weren’t thinking big-picture at all. Not for a long time, at least.” But, as the school year wound down, Jo had a hard time following, or even finding, instructions left by teachers for whom he was substituting. He began teaching less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tension between Jo and Robin escalated into an ultimatum: He had to get more help, because she couldn’t keep living that way. Robin went to a doctor’s appointment with Jo in May, bringing along the autopsy report in which his mother’s illness had finally been diagnosed as Alzheimer’s disease. The document felt cruel in her hands, but she was desperate. She had to push the doctor relentlessly, but he finally conducted a memory test on Jo, and the results warranted an appointment with a specialist.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;startImage&quot; src=&quot;http://site.macleans.ca/longform/alzheimers/images/doctor.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Dr. Michael Borrie discusses Jo's diagnosis with the couple&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;J&lt;/span&gt;o was referred to Dr. Michael Borrie, a geriatrician whose soft and precise speaking voice still curls gently around a New Zealand accent, even after 30 years in London. He’s the medical director of the Aging Brain and Memory Clinic and cognitive clinical trials group at the Parkwood Institute, where Jo and Robin went for an hours-long diagnostic appointment in June 2014. Borrie went over Jo’s medical history and his mother’s illness with them, and Jo completed a battery of cognitive tests while Robin answered questions about what she observed with him day-to-day.&lt;p&gt;One of the tests Jo completed was the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), a widely used 11-question measure of cognitive function. Jo gave the year, season, date and day of the week correctly, but he said it was July instead of June. He rhymed off his country, province and city, but got the name of the hospital and the floor he was on wrong. When the examiner listed three objects, Jo could recall them all immediately, but a few minutes later, he couldn’t remember any. Patients are also asked to write a sentence of any kind, and they earn a point if it makes grammatical sense. Jo wrote, “I am a legend.” The final question asks people to copy a simple diagram of two overlapping pentagons. Jo’s drawing was slightly warped, but he got the necessary components right, and he rendered it with the fine, feathery lines of someone who has been drawing his whole life. The MMSE is scored out of 30. Doctors consider the test results alongside other information about how patients are doing, but generally, a score above 26 is normal; between 20 and 26 suggests mild dementia; 12 to 19, moderate dementia; and below 12, severe. Jo scored 23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Borrie brought Robin alone into one of the little windowless consultation rooms tucked into a hallway near his office; he always speaks to caregivers first, to see if his diagnosis fits what they see every day in the person they love. There was finally an explanation for everything: Jo had Alzheimer’s disease. Robin felt frozen, barely processing the news; the thing they feared most, which had seemed so impossible, was real. Borrie gave her time to collect herself before he brought Jo in to tell him the diagnosis. Jo was devastated; he knew what this disease meant. He and Robin sat there together, struggling to absorb the words. As Borrie explained how the illness would progress, he tried to balance that with a little hope, outlining treatments that might slow the cascade of symptoms. But really, he spent much of the appointment simply consoling them. Robin’s enduring memory would be that while the doctor and his staff had diagnosed Jo with a fatal illness, they were so incredibly kind to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;They were like zombies when they left the appointment. Jo, exhausted from the testing and emotionally wrung out from the result, collapsed into bed. Robin went to the grocery store, but she was so distraught, she couldn’t make her debit card work. Still, under the raw shock, there was something else, too. “There was also relief, at least, knowing this is what it is. We can name it, we can deal with it,” she says. “This is why the last few years have been so hard.”&lt;p&gt;Jo shut down completely for several days. As summer went on, he remained in his own private darkness much of the time, retreating even more than the Alzheimer’s had already caused him to. At the same time, there was a shimmer of denial: They both thought that if Jo took his medications, he could put the disease on pause. And there was some genuine hope, too, in the possibility that he could participate in one of the studies testing potential Alzheimer’s treatments, or that Borrie could persuade a pharmaceutical company to provide a drug in development on compassionate grounds. Chazza and Shawn came to visit with Luke and their younger son, Seth, and Robin’s sister, Taryn, was getting married in the fall, so there were happy events mixed in with the bleak reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August 2014, Jo went to see Borrie again. At the first appointment, the doctor had started him on Aricept, a drug that reduces the breakdown of acetylcholine, a learning and memory chemical that declines in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. Now that Jo’s system had adjusted, Borrie added memantine, a drug that normalizes communication between nerve cells. He also recommended an adult day program Jo could eventually attend, but Jo didn’t like the idea. He would be the youngest person there by decades. And he didn’t need another glimpse of what his future held.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;well&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;'I am mine': The disease starts to show in Jo's writing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jo completed these tests in order to monitor his disease. He was asked to write a sentence of any kind and earned a point if it made grammatical sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Jo completed the MMSE memory test again. He got the date and day of the week wrong and, while he knew the month was August, he guessed the season was spring. Again, he had a hard time naming the building they were in, and he couldn’t recall one of the three words immediately after he heard them. But his pentagon diagram was flawless and, again, rendered in fine, artistic pen-strokes. For a sentence, Jo wrote, “I am myself always and not at all.” It reads as achingly evocative, but it’s possible there was something else going on. “Is this really deep, or is he starting to lose his thoughts?” Borrie wondered. This time, Jo scored 20 out of 30.&lt;p&gt;The consultation rooms where Borrie sees patients are wallpapered in diagrams he uses to explain things. One poster depicts a graph with three lines. The “natural disease path” of Alzheimer’s slopes inexorably downward at a cruel 45-degree angle; the second line, “symptomatic treatment”—the ideal outcome of drugs such as Aricept and memantine—runs parallel to the first, but hovers above it, showing everything a little better off but the basic disease path unchanged; the third line represents “disease-modifying treatment,” and, from diagnosis on, this route marches defiantly through the illness, nearly level with the horizon. For now, that third path—a cure for Alzheimer’s disease—exists only in the hypotheses and hopes of researchers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;omeone asked Barry Greenberg once in a job interview what his life goal was. He said he wanted the packaging for a drug that could treat Alzheimer’s disease framed on his office wall, knowing he played some role in its existence. He was 30 years old when he said that; he’s 59 now, and he’s still working on it. “We had a lot of hubris back in the day, when we first cloned the amyloid precursor gene, that we were gonna have this thing licked within a decade, in the 1990s,” he says of one of the genes that carries a mutation guaranteeing the disease. “Nature has a way of insidiously laughing at that.” Greenberg is director of neuroscience drug discovery and development for the University Health Network and director of strategy for the Toronto Dementia Research Alliance. He’s one of the people leading the search for a drug that could make that third strand on the chart on Borrie’s wall a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most active area of drug research right now is for the very early stages of Alzheimer’s, because the disease is already well-advanced by the time people experience noticeable cognitive problems. “What you’re trying to do is stop a disease process that’s already rip-roaring away in the brain,” Greenberg says. “I personally don’t think we’re going to be able to treat or cure Alzheimer’s disease once it’s established, because the brain is already significantly damaged.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These “prevention studies” require a population of patients who are not yet symptomatic, but are guaranteed to get Alzheimer’s—people with a genetic mutation like Jo’s. There are currently three major projects under way around the world, administering intravenous antibodies and other selected drugs to patients in hopes the treatments can help remove the buildup of amyloid in the brain before it inflicts damage. It appeared initially that Jo was excluded from all these studies because his disease was too advanced, but Borrie found one he’s eligible for, and he’s working to make that happen. It’s too late for Jo himself to benefit, but the key to finding a cure for Alzheimer’s may well lie with people who have his form of the disease. “Here I am, 30 years out from what I thought was a seminal discovery,” Greenberg says, “and it was, in some respects. I’ve still got to say, optimistically, that we’re five years away from identifying something where we can say, ‘This is going to prevent the disease.’ ”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;startImage&quot; src=&quot;http://site.macleans.ca/longform/alzheimers/images/guitar_01.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Jo has always kept his guitar close by his side, even if it now frustrates him occasionally&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;eptember was very hard for Jo and Robin. A new school year started, and Robin and their teacher friends went back to work, but Jo did not: His diagnosis and difficulties the previous spring made teaching an impossibility. On a visit to Ottawa that fall, Jo and Shawn went into the backyard one night with their drinks. Jo could barely get the words out when he told Shawn his teaching days were over. “I can deal with all this other crap, because it is what it is, but that hurt,” Shawn recalls him saying. “That’s me, that’s who I am.” The end of the career he was only just establishing made his illness brutally real. “The disease didn’t take his brain first—it took his happiness, his centre,” Shawn says. The last class Jo ever taught, the previous spring, was Robin’s.&lt;p&gt;She tried to make things sounds better: “It’s like you’re retired. How are you gonna spend your days?” she’d ask. But it was awful, for both of them. Teaching had been a huge part of their shared life, and while that was suddenly gone for Jo, she still walked out the door every morning to the place where they used to work together. Jo tried to fill his time: He wrote and sketched and read, and he would walk to a nearby library and bring home whatever caught his interest. “It sucks,” he says, “but you have to make the best of it, right?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of October, he saw Borrie again and repeated the MMSE. He performed better on the questions about time—for someone as intelligent and educated as Jo, there can be a slight uptick in performance with practice—but he guessed the building he was in was the Hospital for Sick Children. The strokes on his pentagon drawing were skilful as always, but one of the shapes looked as though it were made of popsicle sticks that had been pulled apart. For a sentence, Jo wrote, “I am mine.” The phrase didn’t make any sense, so he didn’t get a point for it. He scored 18 out of 30. An average decline of two to four points on the MMSE would be expected over the course of a year for a patient with Alzheimer’s, but Jo had lost five points in four months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One evening late in the fall, Jo planned to meet Robin at Beal for a dance show. He was going to take a bus he’d been on countless times, but he got on the wrong one, then forgot where he was going. He hadn’t taken his phone with him, and Robin spent frantic hours trying to find him while he rode the bus to the opposite side of London and back. Finally, after midnight, Jo walked in the door of their apartment. That was the end of him taking the bus on his own. In December, Robin’s friend and co-worker, Sandy, took Jo shopping for Robin’s Christmas gifts. Robin had provided a list, but the point wasn’t for her to get what she wanted—it was all about Jo having a victory come Christmas morning. He and Sandy got the cookbooks and tea she asked for, then Jo picked out a Jack Johnson album. Robin loved it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in January this year, the ground dropped out from under them. Robin’s mom, Kathy, had been ill for a long time with heart problems. She caught pneumonia and simply couldn’t recover and, on Jan. 30, she died. Kathy was a creative force—she sewed, knit, quilted, painted and made pottery—who always told you what you really needed to hear, no sugar-coating; Robin is her mother’s daughter. Through the stormiest days of their marriage before Jo’s diagnosis, she never judged—she simply stood by them and loved them. “Moms just know, right?” Robin says, sobbing. “You pick up the phone, you talk to your mom, you don’t have to say anything. It’s a mom.” And her mother’s death was the first life-altering event for Robin during which Jo could not be her source of support. He would notice her sadness, but some days needed to be reminded over and over why she felt that way. As Robin recalls all of this months later, she and Jo sit on opposite ends of the couch in their living room, both of them weeping. He watches her with mournful eyes, as though he’s sitting just a little too far away to reach her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Robin ordered a monitor bracelet. But who will look for an Alzheimer's bracelet on a man in his 30s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;One night at the end of April, things fell apart anew. Jo and Robin were in bed reading when Jo began flailing one arm and staggering around the bedroom. Robin was terrified. She managed to calm him down, and he said he’d thought there was something after him. Once he fell asleep, she spent the rest of the night online, researching Alzheimer’s and hallucinations. The next day, Jo seemed a little foggy, but otherwise normal, and they went out to run errands. While they were in line at a store, Jo suddenly stepped in close to Robin, threw a wild-eyed look over his shoulder, and launched into the same defensive motions. This episode lasted much longer; two men nearby helped Robin guide Jo to the floor and someone called the paramedics. “I was a total, total mess,” Robin says. “It was terrifying thinking, ‘Is this what it’s going to be now? Is this what life is going to be?’ ” After several hours in emergency, the doctors diagnosed Jo with seizures, which are not uncommon with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;p&gt;The next day, he and Robin were in the car when he had another seizure. “His entire face blanked out,” Robin says. “It was like somebody else was there.” She asked if he was okay, and he couldn’t answer. She pulled the car over. “Do you know who I am?” she asked. No. “Do you know who you are?” she asked. No. “I’m Robin,” she said, horrified. “I’m Robin?” Jo asked. “No, you’re Jo. I’m Robin, I’m your wife,” she explained. “Okay, you’re my wife,” Jo replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was the worst,” Robin says. “All of a sudden, it was like we went off a cliff.” Jo came out of the episode quickly, but Robin was shaken to her core. The next day, Jo saw Borrie and, not long after, he went to a seizure clinic, where they put him on seizure medication. For a week or two after the incidents, it was as though the Alzheimer’s had leaped ahead several months. But soon, the hangover effect wore off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jo did the MMSE again at Borrie’s office; it had now been nearly a year since he was diagnosed. It was April 2015, but he guessed the year was 2014 and the month was September, and he couldn’t name the building where the clinic was located. One of his pentagons looked as if it had been broken open and moved to one side, and his sentence was, “I am awesome!” This time, he scored 14 out of 30. (He may have still been affected by the seizures; a few months later, his score improved to 16.) He was 38 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;well&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pentagons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of Jo's cognitive function tests involved copying a drawing of two overlapping pentagons. An average decline is two to four points on the test over a year. Jo lost nine points in 13 months. A score from 20 to 26 suggests mild dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;t’s sometimes difficult now for Jo to keep track of the words or ideas in a conversation, so he uses emotion as an entry point instead. He focuses on people’s expressions or individual features to read the mood, and he’s often animated and sardonic in his responses. A conversation is easier if it’s a familiar topic or in a quiet environment with people he knows well. “Sometimes I get nervous and just start creating alphabet,” he says. “It’s just a mess.”&lt;p&gt;One Saturday in mid-June, he and Robin joined Sandy, her husband, Joe, and their five-year-old daughter, Chloe, for dinner at a gourmet burger place downtown. The restaurant was noisy and crowded. Jo initially decided on a burger, but the server bombarded him with options, and when the food arrived, it turned out Jo had ordered a bucket of poutine. When they’re around people who don’t know about the Alzheimer’s, Robin keeps tabs in case Jo needs a hand, but otherwise lets him be. “The waiter didn’t know. He thinks he’s a 30-something dude out with his friends, ordering supper,” Robin says. “It’s almost like an invisible illness.” Later in the meal, Jo leaned toward Joe (they call them Jo-Jo and Joey, respectively, to keep them straight) and growled in a goofy voice, “Drink your Coke!” Drily and lightly, Robin said, “Don’t make it weird, Jo. Don’t make it weird,” and the conversation rolled on. “Things got weird” is their shorthand for moments when Alzheimer’s elbows its way in. Just as there are familiar places that are easier for Jo to navigate, there are also friends with whom everything is fine, no matter what.  When Robin talks about the constant concessions they must make to this greedy disease, she says, “This is the reality” often, as though she’s reminding herself there’s no point in wasting energy fighting it. There are moments when you can practically see her taking the things that are too hard to look at and bundling them off to one side. “For better or worse—I’m not sure yet—one of the things I am good at is I can compartmentalize,” she says. “It’s an emotional thing, but you have to leave your emotions out of it. You can’t think about all the stuff that you wanted to be, or hoped to be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s different with Sandy and another friend, Sue Silcox. They both teach English at Beal, and the three of them have one of those friendships you see in a sitcom and wish for in real life. On a steamy Sunday near the end of the school year, Robin met them for lunch, and she was still five feet away from the table when Sue launched into a story about being shocked by the electric fence at her parents’ farm. They spent the next hour alternating between crying and laughing, telling each story as a group performance. For Sandy, the hardest thing is when she knows Robin is just shoving aside things she can’t deal with because she’s in survival mode. “I know that, when she’s ready to open that box, it’s going to be awful and ugly and sad,” Sandy said. The waiting is worse than when it all falls apart, because then they simply put their arms around Robin. A short time later, Sandy said something that made Robin cry, and Sue rummaged in her purse and pulled out a weird little knitted cloth her daughter picked up at a church retreat. “I only have a prayer shawl,” Sue deadpanned, handing it to Robin in lieu of a tissue. The three of them stared at it, then shrieked with laughter. Robin and Jo’s friends always want to know how they can help and, since they can’t do what they really want—fix everything—they’ve learned the importance of frozen yogourt runs, nights out where you pretend everything is fine and breaking the tension. “I miss Jo, too,” Sue says softly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;well&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;lzheimer’s demands new counter-manoeuvres all the time, but that becomes invisible in the blur of everyday life. It’s only when they look back that it becomes clear how much has changed. Last fall, Jo needed only a few basic reminders from Robin to manage his day. By the end of the school year, that evolved into extensive night-before preparations and a daily memo reminding him of medication, meals and the right clothes for the weather. Robin also started drawing two little boxes on the note where he could check off his allotted cups of coffee, after she came home a few times to find a pile of empty K-Cups and an extremely caffeinated Jo who had lost track of his guzzling. “I felt great,” Jo declares with an enormous smile. “I was energetic, I could go and run.”&lt;p&gt;Jo often starts a chore and get distracted; they joke he’s like the dog in Up, powerless to resist the allure of a squirrel. But recently, Robin realized Jo was leaving dishes on the counter not because he’d abandoned emptying the dishwasher, but because he no longer knew where they went. They talked about labelling things, but Jo doesn’t want that. “I don’t want to live in a museum,” he told her. “I still want it to be home.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a sign on the inside of the apartment door at eye height, reminding Jo to text Robin where he’s going before he leaves, to write a note reminding himself of his destination, and to text Robin when he returns. It’s not a perfect system, but it helps while she’s working. Jo loves to listen to music and walk the streets around their apartment. He relies on a sort of intuitive assessment to know where the edges of that territory are: If the street signs and the view around him are familiar, he feels a general comfort that tells him it’s a good zone in which to travel. Robin is grateful for the Find My iPhone function, because she can check on him remotely if he doesn’t respond to her texts. “There are times he’s going to go out and I’m not going to know about it,” she says. “It’s very stressful to think of those situations in the future, but we can only deal with them when they come.” She’s ordered a monitor bracelet, but she worries about whether it will be helpful: Who would think to look for an Alzheimer’s bracelet on a man in his 30s?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Alzheimer’s moved in, their Saturday-morning ritual was grabbing coffee at Starbucks, heading to Covent Garden Market and running errands, and the rule was: No talking about work. They kept up that routine, even when work was no longer something they could talk about. But then there were a couple of incidents when Robin went to use a washroom and, when she came back, Jo was gone. “It feels like I have no idea where I am, and I have to start walking somewhere so that I can find something,” Jo explains. “I have to find her, because, obviously, she’s the one that’s gonna pick me up.” Those moments are awash in panic for both of them, so now the rule is that they stay within eyesight. The perpetual balancing act between Jo’s independence and his safety is hard on both of them. “It’s frustrating,” Jo says. “And I know that Robin doesn’t mean to be condescending, but . . .” She agrees with him, instantly and gently: “It feels that way, sometimes.” Each time Robin writes one of those increasingly detailed notes for Jo, she asks if it’s okay with him. And it isn’t, really, and she knows that, but this is what they have to do, and he knows that, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;'When I look back, sometimes I think that was harder than when we finally got the diagnosis,' Robin says. 'He was not the person I knew; he was not the person I married.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Before Jo’s diagnosis, the unknown enemy strained their marriage to the breaking point. Now, the disease has fundamentally altered it. “Jo is not able to do anything that you would consider in a marriage. It has really turned into a caregiver role; I am taking care of him,” Robin says. “There’s still a lot of love there, but it’s not a relationship that is two-sided. It just can’t be.” It would be a mistake to look at that clear-eyed assessment and think those words aren’t costly for Robin. “It’s hard sometimes, because when you say, ‘my husband,’ there are these things you think of that a husband is—and he was, for sure—that just aren’t there anymore,” she says. Asked how he feels about it, Jo says, quietly and deliberately, “I would love to be able to be the person that I was, but it’s not going to happen.”&lt;p&gt;One of the reactions Robin finds bizarre is when someone gushes that it’s so wonderful what she’s doing for Jo. This is ludicrous and insulting to her, because, if she just can’t quite put Jo in the “husband” box anymore, here is what he is to her, and what that means: “He’s still my family,” she says. “If your family is in trouble, you take care of them. There isn’t another choice. You don’t just walk away.” Robin has contemplated whether she would feel differently about what Alzheimer’s has done to their marriage if they were four decades older. She doesn’t think so. “You’re mourning the person who’s sitting on the couch with you,” she says. “There are glimmers now and then, but the essence of the person is changed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s has taken so many choices away from Jo. He didn’t get to decide when his career ended, or when the plots of his favourite books slipped away, or how this disease affected his wife and the other people who love them. So here is what Jo wants now: He wants to decide how much suffering is too much, and when his life should end with dignity, and he wants to be able to communicate so he can say goodbye. What he does not want is to linger in a care facility. “Thinking of my mother and how she suffered for so many years, it’s not right,” he says, weeping. Robin talks, ever so gingerly, about why Jo wants to draw his own line in the sand, and he reaches out to touch her for the first time, tentatively stroking her leg. “It’s a disease where there isn’t a whole lot of hope. There is zero chance of a happy ending,” she says. “That’s just the reality of the treatment of the disease right now. The only thing in front of us at the end of the disease, and Jo’s life, is a very, very horrible way to die.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re working with lawyers to try to find a way for Jo to record his wishes, so he can speak for himself in the future. On Feb. 6, 2015, the Supreme Court decriminalized physician-assisted death for people suffering with a “grievous and irremediable” medical condition. The court suspended its ruling for a year to provide time for a change in the law, and the federal government may ask for an extension. However, the court said nothing about dementia in its decision and, even in jurisdictions such as the Netherlands, where people may request an assisted death through advance-care planning, doctors have been extremely reluctant to act on that. Dementia is problematic, because, at the point when people may want their lives to end, they are no longer capable of giving consent and, when they could still consent, most would consider it too early to die. “The process is really fraught at the moment, and Canadians are not in a position to have their wishes respected, and we need to change that,” says Wanda Morris, CEO of Dying with Dignity Canada. This does not feel like an imminent issue for Jo, but the path of his disease is unpredictable. “We’re in a bit of a race against time,” Robin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;'It’s a disease where there isn’t a whole lot of hope. There is zero chance of a happy ending'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;n the Alzheimer’s landscape, it’s nearly as hard to know what’s around the next bend as it is to predict the far horizon. Summer once again offered a little reprieve, but, as for what life will look like in the fall and beyond, they simply don’t know. Jo has started spending two days a week at a day program run by Alzheimer Outreach Services of McCormick Home. The program is filled with thoughtful touches: The walls are covered in exquisite artwork created by clients, there are real bowling shirts for the raucous Xbox Live bowling league, and staff members communicate on headsets rather than a barking PA system. Jo is the youngest client they’ve ever had, which is one of the reasons he was once so reluctant to consider it, but it’s a warm place of real humanity. “We will surround them,” says Karen Johnson, the program’s director. “We will surround this family.”&lt;p&gt;Jo and Robin’s world now mostly revolves around their apartment and the homes of close friends, where they can relax and drop the effort-: If Alzheimer’s hijacks a conversation, everyone understands and nobody cares. They live in the perpetual present now. Every day is different and the larger reality is as vast as the sky, so they’ve learned to inhabit one square on the calendar at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are victories and heartaches in tiny daily moments that might escape notice in a different sort of life. One night in June, when Robin was working furiously on a curriculum project, Jo made dinner for the two of them. He had to put the chicken back on the grill three times to make sure it was cooked, and he served it with an unconventional side dish of pickled beets, but it was a thoughtful kindness Robin loved. A few days later, she came home from work to find the strings yanked off Jo’s guitar-. He was playing and tried to adjust the tuning, but something went awry. After they cleared away the mess, they sat on the balcony, had a beer and listened to Pearl Jam, and the night got a lot better. Near the end of June, Jo went back to Kapuskasing to stay with Robin’s dad for a few weeks. Jo and Robin talked one night, and he was so excited about buying the new Mumford and Sons album; that made her happy, but with a heavy heart, because they already own the album and have listened to it a few times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;startImage&quot; src=&quot;http://site.macleans.ca/longform/alzheimers/images/art.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;On the couple's wall is a collage by Robin Giles, featuring the Pearl Jam song title &quot;I Am Mine&quot; written over a map of Ontario&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;On the sunny yellow wall of their living room, just above a big pile of Robin’s mom’s sewing supplies, hangs one of Robin’s artworks. It’s a map of Ontario, with Kapuskasing featured prominently, and stencilled on the map are the words, “I am mine.” She made the piece two years ago, long before Jo was diagnosed.&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing: Jo deserved one more point on that memory test he did back in October. When he wrote, “I am mine,” it looked as though it didn’t make sense. But it does—and he wrote the same sentence on the test again a few weeks ago. That’s a Pearl Jam song, and the lyrics go like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The north is to south what the clock is to time / There’s east and there’s west and there’s everywhere life / I know I was born and I know that I’ll die / The in between is mine / I am mine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That wasn’t Alzheimer’s. That was Jo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>The Bulk of Software Engineering in 2018 Is Just Plumbing</title>
<link>https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/plumbing</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/plumbing</guid>
<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I read a post online recently about how some software engineer was asked to complete a technically complex, jargon-filled coding challenge over the phone in order to get a job. He did well enough on the call to get an offer, but after he started the new job, he realized it wasn’t going to be the academically challenging role he was hoping for. No, he’d just be building basic CRUD applications for the web with a legacy system haphazardly running on whatever virtual machine could be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happens all the time during job-screening. We put engineers through rigorous screening processes and ask them intellectually stimulating questions, only to hire them and put them into the admittedly dull task of wiring up 5 or 6 services and making the screen look pretty. I’m not saying there aren’t skills involved in those tasks - I’m simply saying that those aren’t the same skills being tested for in most whiteboarding-style challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/rethinking-hiring&quot;&gt;Here’s how I revamped my hiring process with this trend in mind&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;lets-stop-sugar-coating-it&quot;&gt;Let’s stop sugar-coating it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software is created when its presence provides more business value than its absence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it’s appealing to read about software craftsmanship and strive for excellence in everything we do, when it really comes down to it, our job wouldn’t exist if we didn’t make money (or save money) for some business somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, the industry’s state makes sense. Just like plumbers, &lt;strong&gt;we are paid to know our tools and understand how they work together to make a usable piece of equipment&lt;/strong&gt;, not to reinvent working technology or spend 80 hours optimizing something that 5% of our users will use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;put-it-in-perspective&quot;&gt;Put it in perspective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small to medium sized businesses rarely deal with scaling or optimization problems anymore - partly because hardware has gotten so cheap, and partly because foundational open source software has gotten so good. This is a great thing, and we as software developers should embrace it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back to the plumbing example. Imagine you owned a small restaurant with one bathroom and 10 employees. You get a few hundred customers per week and maybe 10% of them use your bathroom. Obviously, you’ve got to have a working bathroom, but does it need to be anything fancier or more advanced than your home toilet? &lt;strong&gt;Do you need 10 stalls, motion-activated faucets, Dyson hand dryers, and marble counters?&lt;/strong&gt; Probably not, unless you’re just trying to project some facade of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9bS3JGQ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We do this all the time in the world of startup software engineering though.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small business with 5-10 employees building a software-as-a-service web app needs to have a reliable, secure system, but does it need to be that much more robust than an off-the-shelf service provides? &lt;strong&gt;Do you really need AI-powered search, real-time dashboards for every internal team member, microsecond optimizations on your home page, and split testing for every feature you release?&lt;/strong&gt; Probably not unless you’re just trying to project a facade of success…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as a good small business owner should hire a humble plumber who knows the standard tools required for small bathrooms, and will pay him market rate, &lt;strong&gt;a good engineering manager should hire &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/hero-myth&quot;&gt;humble team players&lt;/a&gt; who use industry-standard tools to build reliable software, and pay them market rate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, what I’m seeing is a lot of false projections from engineering managers. They give the impression during the interview that every person they hire must be a senior engineer, has to have “big data” experience, or has to know every sorting algorithm by heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-engineers-are-guilty-of-over-engineering&quot;&gt;We (engineers) are guilty of over-engineering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is that we over-engineer the software we work on. I am guilty of this as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came to the Graide Network and immediately started breaking our legacy app into microservices. Now I’ve had to build custom tooling just to help new developers get things running on their local machines - not something that is truly worth my time this early on in our business’ lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also made it harder on myself to hire people. I don’t want to limit my hiring pool to engineers who know multiple specific web frameworks, Docker containers, microservices, Redis, and MySQL, but I’ve built myself into a corner with all these choices. Lately I’ve realized this, and been starting to think of ways to simplify our stack, but that will have to come in a future blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;investors-are-guilty-of-pushing-it-on-us&quot;&gt;Investors are guilty of pushing it on us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other side is investor and media pressure. In the startup world this is especially pronounced as I’ve found investors as likely to latch onto buzzwords as reporters are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, so you’re building an app? Does it use AI? Blockchain? ? Take my money and do it!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you’ve sold yourself to an investor as an AI/Blockchain/etc. company, so you’ve got to hire engineers who do that thing, even if you’re not sure it’s actually going to help you build a better business or not. This means you’re going to shun candidates with 10+ years of experience in existing tech to hire slick kids who jump from buzz-word to buzz-word chasing trends. &lt;strong&gt;It’s like hiring a plumber with 3 years of experience who invented his own tools: high risk, very low reward.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-we-do-about-it&quot;&gt;What do we do about it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we’re here, living in a world where most “software engineering” is essentially plumbing. What should we do about it? What does it mean for our careers? Will the money keep flowing forever?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, we should recognize and embrace the fact that we can build more with less.&lt;/strong&gt; What it will mean is that the crummy parts of our job will probably get automated or tools will be built that will make it possible for business people to do them for us. For example, I used to have to make code changes every time someone on our team wanted to change an automated email’s copy. Now, they just have to edit a template in Sendgrid’s nice visual editor, and I never even know that a change has been made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, we should consider the complexity required when designing systems.&lt;/strong&gt; If an off-the-shelf solution exists, grab it, don’t build it from scratch. Get good at soldering pieces together so that you seem more productive, faster, and better at your job than the software artisans out there who have to custom-build their own framework every time they start a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, we should set realistic expectations in our job listings.&lt;/strong&gt; No more coding exercises that require a CS degree for jobs that require little more than importing libraries and understanding HTTP requests. Yes, some jobs will require micro-optimizations, and that’s fine, but recognize that those are few and far between. Your software is likely not as special as you think it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/code-notenough-karl-l-hughes/&quot;&gt;don’t get comfortable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; This isn’t a popular opinion among software engineers, but I believe that many in the field are overpaid relative to the difficulty of the work they do. Sometimes it’s because they are the only people who know some obscure corner of their field, sometimes it’s because their company’s gatekeepers are preventing full access to the talent market, and sometimes it’s because other engineers insisted they overbuild things such that junior devs will take a long time to understand it. In any case, &lt;strong&gt;we can’t stop learning if we want to remain relevant and well-paid.&lt;/strong&gt; Keep going deep and wide in your knowledge, and learn how to filter out the hype from the truly ground-breaking technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think? I imagine many of you in the field will have a different opinion, so let me hear it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/karllhughes&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>South Korea has limited a working week to 52 hours, in order to stop overwork</title>
<link>https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/07/south-korea-is-trying-to-stop-overwork-by-limiting-the-maximum-workweek-to-52-hours</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/07/south-korea-is-trying-to-stop-overwork-by-limiting-the-maximum-workweek-to-52-hours</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;52.159815242494&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea has implemented a new 52 hour work week in an attempt to stop chronic overwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country is trying to promote a greater work-life balance by lowering the maximum hours people can work from 68 to 40 hours, plus another 12 hour of overtime. Smaller firms won't need to make changes until 2020, but larger firms that breach the new rules could be fined up to $17,815. Executives could face two years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It will be an important opportunity to move away from a society of overwork and move toward a society of spending time with families,&quot; President Moon Jae-in said on Monday. &quot;The most important thing is that it will be a fundamental solution to protecting the lives and safety of the people by reducing the number of deaths from overwork, industrial accidents and sleep-deprived driving.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes were supposed to go into effect for large companies, public institutions, and government offices on July 1, but the government last week backpedaled, slightly agreeing that firms will have six months to implement the new schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;40&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being forced to soften the rollout of the policy indicates how much the plan was driven by the government, rather than workers themselves that rely on overtime to earn enough money. The policy is key for President Moon, who is hoping it will lead to more productivity, more jobs and, potentially, more babies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;25.658181818182&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea has one of the longest workweeks in the developed world, with people spending 300 more hours at work than in the US on average, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=ANHRS&quot;&gt;Organization for Economic Cooperations and Development (OECD)&lt;/a&gt;. It also has one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2054rank.html&quot;&gt;lowest birth rates&lt;/a&gt; in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For years, we have overlooked the real culprit of the problem — our country’s vast gender disparity and inhumanely long working hours,&quot; Chung Hyun-back, South Korea's family minister, told AFP in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Under such unfair circumstances, young women usually choose their career, not marriage and childbirth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five-day workweek was only introduced in South Korea in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Guidelines for Brutalist Web Design</title>
<link>https://brutalist-web.design/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://brutalist-web.design/</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;em&gt;brutalism&lt;/em&gt; is often associated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist_architecture&quot;&gt;Brutalist Architecture&lt;/a&gt;, however it can apply to other forms of construction, such as web design. This website explains how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://brutalist-web.design/images/washington-dc-ec-02-station-small.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Washington DC Engine Company 02's Fire Station&quot; class=&quot;db ba b--silver&quot; nopin=&quot;nopin&quot;/&gt; An example of brutalist architecture, DC Engine Company 02's Fire Station &lt;a href=&quot;https://brutalist-web.design/images/washington-dc-ec-02-station.png&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot;&gt;View full-size (11MB)&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;em&gt;brutalism&lt;/em&gt; is derived from the French &lt;em&gt;béton brut&lt;/em&gt;, meaning “raw concrete”. Although most brutalist buildings are made from concrete, we're more interested in the term &lt;em&gt;raw&lt;/em&gt;. Concrete brutalist buildings often reflect back the forms used to make them, and their overall design tends to adhere to the concept of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_to_materials&quot;&gt;truth to materials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A website's materials aren't HTML tags, CSS, or JavaScript code. Rather, they are its content and the context in which it's consumed. A website is for a visitor, using a browser, running on a computer to read, watch, listen, or perhaps to interact. A website that embraces Brutalist Web Design is raw in its focus on &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt;, and prioritization of the website visitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brutalist Web Design is honest about what a website is and what it &lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt;. A website is not a magazine, though it might have magazine-like articles. A website is not an application, although you might use it to purchase products or interact with other people. A website is not a database, although it might be driven by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A website is about giving visitors content to enjoy and ways to interact with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design guidelines outlined above—and detailed below—all are in the service of making websites more of what they are and less of what they aren't. These aren't restrictive rules to produce boring, minimalist websites. Rather these are a set of priorities that put the visitor to your site—the entire reason your website exists—front and center in all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;mt0 fw3 dib f7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brutalist-web.design/#detailed-guidelines&quot;&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is a detailed look into each of the guidelines listed above. As with all artistic constraints while you may find them frustrating, you should also find them inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;mt0 fw3 dib f7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brutalist-web.design/#readable-content&quot;&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most websites exist to deliver content for you to consume, either words (such as on this site), or images, such as on Pinterest. To be true to that nature, the content must be readable in all browsers. Some screens are very large, while others are very small. Some browsers, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader&quot;&gt;screen readers&lt;/a&gt;, have no screen at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, a website that uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/dom.html#elements&quot;&gt;HTML as intended&lt;/a&gt; and has no custom styling will be readable on all screens and devices. Only the act of design can make the content less readable, though it can certainly make it more. For example, this website does not use default styles, yet, it is readable on any size screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;mt4&quot; readability=&quot;18.468899521531&quot;&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;mt0 fw3 dib f7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brutalist-web.design/#clickables&quot;&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;A website is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext&quot;&gt;hypertext&lt;/a&gt; document that allows for two primary forms of interaction: navigating a link to another location, and submitting information back to a server. These functions are performed, respectively, by hyperlinks and buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although JavaScript allows any element to respond to a click, websites are not applications, and the vast majority of websites should have no need to resort to such heroics in order to allow the visitor to navigate or submit data. Further, clickable areas of a page that are not obviously hyperlinks or buttons can confuse the visitor, causing them to perform unwanted actions or miss links entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To trick or deceive the visitor goes against the nature of a website, which is to deliver information and interact honestly with a visitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;mt4&quot; readability=&quot;46.062992125984&quot;&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;mt0 fw3 dib f7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brutalist-web.design/#hyperlinks&quot;&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned when &lt;a href=&quot;https://brutalist-web.design/#clickables&quot;&gt;discussing clicks&lt;/a&gt;, only hyperlinks and buttons should respond to clicks, since this maintains an honest and transparent interaction with a visitor. To maintain a truth to materials, it follows that the appearance of these elements should also be honest and clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hyperlink has no analog in the real world. Since the dawn of the web, convention dictates a hyperlink use an underline to reveal its existence (which is a wonderful solution, since underlining has no place in modern typesetting). Because of this convention, there is no clearer indicator of more content than a bit of underlined text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buttons, however, do have an analog in both the real world and computer programs. The browser being a computer program, it stands to reason that buttons rendered in a browser should look like buttons rendered on the computer operating system running said browser. With no effort at all, this is precisely what happens. See for yourself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f7 i fw3 red ma0&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: this is not a real form&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This button is unambiguous, both in its function and its difference from a hyperlink. Where a link promises more information for the visitor, a button agrees to submit &lt;em&gt;the visitors information&lt;/em&gt; to the server. Hiding this interaction behind a hyperlink or unadorned text betrays the core nature of a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the default visual appearance of a button is often unpleasant or clashes with the visual language of the site. Fortunately, many forms indicate button-ness to a visitor, and it's often trivial to style a button to both match the visual language of a site while also looking eminently pressable. Here is an example of a site using a yellow color scheme and serifed fonts that has an obvious button:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f7 i fw3 red ma0&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: this is not a real form&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice also that the form elements are true to themselves. An operating system has a visual language for collecting input from a visitor, and a Brutalist Web Design stays as close to that as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;mt3 cf&quot; readability=&quot;8.9018302828619&quot;&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;mt0 fw3 dib f7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brutalist-web.design/#back-button&quot;&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://brutalist-web.design/images/netscape-back-button.png&quot; alt=&quot;Netscape Communicator's Back button&quot; class=&quot;ba b--dark-gray&quot; nopin=&quot;nopin&quot;/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Communicator&quot;&gt;Netscape Communicator's&lt;/a&gt; iconic Back button
&lt;p&gt;All browsers have a built-in button called the &lt;em&gt;back button&lt;/em&gt;. This button is form of “undo”, taking the user back to where they were before their last navigational click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To break this core and enduring feature of the web requires a confluence of design and programming (such feats are better applied to smoothing the experience of going back after a form submission). It also requires either ignorance of or contempt for the site visitor, as the back button is often their only means of undoing an errant click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;mt4&quot; readability=&quot;24.280427631579&quot;&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;mt0 fw3 dib f7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brutalist-web.design/#scrolling&quot;&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;A website is not a book or a magazine. Because it's viewed in a browser, users can scroll the browser's viewport to read content that can't fit on one screen. This mechanism works beautifully and allows visitors to read content uninterrupted by clicking and page-reloading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While long-form content may require navigation and multiple pages, there's rarely need to artificially paginate articles, blog posts, or other medium-length content simply to satisfy advertisers or inflate engagement numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrolling also allows the visitor to consume content at their pace using a method they prefer. Like the back button, this can only be broken by intentional design and careless implementation. Advertisers need not suffer from scrollable content, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;baskerville tc ml5-ns mr5-ns pa1 ba br1 bg-near-white dark-gray&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;b tracked-tight helvetica tl ml2 mt0 ma0 pa0&quot;&gt;Promotion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;f5 tracked-tight fw3 ttu mt0&quot;&gt;11 Practices You Can Start Doing Now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://brutalist-web.design/images/sweng-cover.png&quot; class=&quot;w-33 shadow-5&quot; alt=&quot;Book Cover for The Senior Software Engineer&quot; nopin=&quot;nopin&quot;/&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was an ad for one of my books. It was clearly marked, and easy to scroll past while you continue to read this site. It might not be the most creative way to place an advertisement amongst the text, but it demonstrates clearly that the visitors core need to easily consume a site's content need not be at odds for that site to sell advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;cf&quot; readability=&quot;28.784810126582&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A website is not an application or a video game. It is for content, and so its design must serve that purpose. Being true to these materials need not imply a boring website or require that all sites look the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;dn db-ns fl helvetica f6 fw3 w-50-ns bg-washed-blue dark-gray pl2 pr2 pt1 pb1 mr3 mt1 mb1 tr&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fl&quot;&gt;🧐&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web pages don't all need to look the same—they just need to stay true to what they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, on large screens this section has a pull quote with a washed blue background, a different text font, and an emoji! While this design employs decoration, it's not distracting (though it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; on a small screen, which is why it's not shown to those visitors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decoration for its own sake, often to satisfy the vanity of the designer, goes counter to Brutalist Web Design. Such needless decoration distracts the visitor from the reason for visiting and makes the content secondary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same can be said of unrelated content, such as misleading links, sensationalist headlines, or distracting images. These all attempt to take the visitor away from the content either for advertising or to create a false increase in “engagement”. Effort should be spent on compelling content, not trickery. Content drives engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;cf&quot; readability=&quot;27.207725321888&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Websites aren't physical like a book or magazine. Their contents must be downloaded over a computer network and then rendered in a web browser. This takes time, but visitors are accustomed to this (up to a point).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider that the entirety of &lt;span class=&quot;i&quot;&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/span&gt; by Jane Austen is &lt;span class=&quot;nowrap&quot;&gt;708 kilobytes&lt;/span&gt;. To download this much data using a very slow mobile connection would be around one second (try it for yourself by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1342/1342-0.txt&quot;&gt;reading it on Project Gutenberg&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;span class=&quot;i&quot;&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/span&gt; is over 200 pages long, and would take &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howlongtoreadthis.com/book_details.php?asin=1503290565&quot;&gt;over three hours&lt;/a&gt; to read. Certainly a news article, tweet, or product catalog can be downloaded and rendered in a comparable amount of time to a &lt;em&gt;novel&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that by adhering to the other guidelines, your website will download and render quickly. By embracing its nature and materials, a website adhering to Brutalist Web Design is fast. It allows the system of network, browser, content, and operating system to work together smoothly and efficiently, as they were designed to. Even with decoration, advertising, and imagery, a website embracing Brutalist Web Design will respect your visitors time, bandwidth, and battery.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The rise of &amp;#039;pseudo-AI&amp;#039;: how tech firms quietly use humans to do bots&amp;#039; work</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/06/artificial-intelligence-ai-humans-bots-tech-companies</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/06/artificial-intelligence-ai-humans-bots-tech-companies</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to build a service powered by artificial intelligence. So hard, in fact, that some startups have worked out it’s cheaper and easier to get humans to behave like robots than it is to get machines to behave like humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Using a human to do the job lets you skip over a load of technical and business development challenges. It doesn’t scale, obviously, but it allows you to build something and skip the hard part early on,” said Gregory Koberger, CEO of ReadMe, who says he has come across a lot of “pseudo-AIs”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s essentially prototyping the AI with human beings,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This practice was brought to the fore this week in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/techs-dirty-secret-the-app-developers-sifting-through-your-gmail-1530544442&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Wall Street Journal article&lt;/a&gt; highlighting the hundreds of third-party app developers that Google allows to access people’s inboxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of the San Jose-based company Edison Software, artificial intelligence engineers went through the personal email messages of hundreds of users – with their identities redacted – to improve a “smart replies” feature. The company did not mention that humans would view users’ emails in its privacy policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-2 | 1&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third parties highlighted in the WSJ article are far from the first ones to do it. In 2008, Spinvox, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jul/23/spinvox-answer-back&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;a company that converted voicemails into text messages&lt;/a&gt;, was accused of using humans in overseas call centres rather than machines to do its work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, Bloomberg highlighted the plight of the humans spending 12 hours a day pretending to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-18/the-humans-hiding-behind-the-chatbots&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;chatbots for calendar scheduling services such as X.ai and Clara&lt;/a&gt;. The job was so mind-numbing that human employees said they were looking forward to being replaced by bots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, the business expense management app Expensify admitted that it had been using humans to transcribe at least some of the receipts it claimed to process using its “smartscan technology”. Scans of the receipts were being posted to Amazon’s Mechanical Turk crowdsourced labour tool, where low-paid workers were reading and transcribing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wonder if Expensify SmartScan users know MTurk workers enter their receipts,” said Rochelle LaPlante, a “Turker” and advocate for gig economy workers on Twitter. “I’m looking at someone’s Uber receipt with their full name, pick-up and drop-off addresses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Facebook, which has invested heavily in AI, relied on humans for its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2015/11/3/11620286/facebooks-virtual-assistant-m-is-super-smart-its-also-probably-a-human&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;virtual assistant for Messenger, M&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, humans are used to train the AI system and improve its accuracy. A company called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scaleapi.com/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Scale&lt;/a&gt; offers a bank of human workers to provide training data for self-driving cars and other AI-powered systems. “Scalers” will, for example, look at camera or sensor feeds and label cars, pedestrians and cyclists in the frame. With enough of this human calibration, the AI will learn to recognise these objects itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other cases, companies fake it until they make it, telling investors and users they have developed a scalable AI technology while secretly relying on human intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;js-tweet tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tweet__user-name&quot;&gt;Gregory Koberger&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;tweet__user-id&quot;&gt;(@gkoberger)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; class=&quot;tweet-body&quot;&gt;How to start an AI startup&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Hire a bunch of minimum wage humans to pretend to be AI pretending to be human&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Wait for AI to be invented&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gkoberger/status/704745266901966848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;tweet-date&quot;&gt;March 1, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alison Darcy, a psychologist and founder of Woebot, a mental health support chatbot, describes this as the “Wizard of Oz design technique”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You simulate what the ultimate experience of something is going to be. And a lot of time when it comes to AI, there is a person behind the curtain rather than an algorithm,” she said, adding that building a good AI system required a “ton of data” and that sometimes designers wanted to know if there was sufficient demand for a service before making the investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach was not appropriate in the case of a psychological support service like Woebot, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As psychologists we are guided by a code of ethics. Not deceiving people is very clearly one of those ethical principles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/virtual-therapists-help-veterans-open-up-about-ptsd/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Research has shown&lt;/a&gt; that people tend to disclose more when they think they are talking to a machine, rather than a person, because of the stigma associated with seeking help for one’s mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team from the University of Southern California tested this with a virtual therapist called Ellie. They found that veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder were more likely to divulge their symptoms when they knew that Ellie was an AI system versus when they were told there was a human operating the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-2 | 2&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others think companies should always be transparent about how their services operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t like it,” said LaPlante of companies that pretend to offer AI-powered services but actually employ humans. “It feels dishonest and deceptive to me, neither of which is something I’d want from a business I’m using.&lt;br tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And on the worker side, it feels like we’re being pushed behind a curtain. I don’t like my labour being used by a company that will turn around and lie to their customers about what’s really happening.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ethical quandary also raises its head with AI systems that pretend to be human. One recent example of this is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/08/google-duplex-assistant-phone-calls-robot-human&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Google Duplex, a robot assistant that makes eerily lifelike phone calls complete with “ums” and “ers” to book appointments&lt;/a&gt; and make reservations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an initial backlash, Google said its AI would identify itself to the humans it spoke to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In their demo version, it feels marginally deceptive in a low-impact conversation,” said Darcy. Although booking a table at a restaurant might seem like a low-stakes interaction, the same technology could be much more manipulative in the wrong hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would happen if you could make lifelike calls simulating the voice of a celebrity or politician, for example?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s already major fear around AI and it’s not really helping the conversation when there’s a lack of transparency,” Darcy said.&lt;/p&gt;

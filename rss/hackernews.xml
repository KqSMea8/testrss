But Facebook was already doing this surreptitiously on some Android devices until October 2017, exploiting the way an older Android API handled permissions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside id=&quot;social-left&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;89 posters participating, including story author.&quot; class=&quot;comment-count icon-comment-bubble-down&quot; href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/03/facebook-scraped-call-text-message-data-for-years-from-android-phones/?comments=1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;comment-count-before&quot;&gt;reader comments&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;comment-count-number&quot;&gt;157&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share this story&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;This past week, a New Zealand man was looking through the data Facebook had collected from him in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/help/131112897028467?helpref=page_content&quot;&gt;an archive&lt;/a&gt; he had pulled down from the social networking site. While scanning the information Facebook had stored about his contacts, Dylan McKay discovered something distressing: Facebook also had about two years worth of phone call metadata from his Android phone, including names, phone numbers, and the length of each call made or received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Downloaded my facebook data as a ZIP file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow it has my entire call history with my partner's mum &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/CIRUguf4vD&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/CIRUguf4vD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Dylan McKay (@dylanmckaynz) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dylanmckaynz/status/976368845635035138?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 21, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experience has been shared by a number of other Facebook users who spoke with Ars, as well as independently by us—my own Facebook data archive, I found, contained call-log data for &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/07/paint-it-black-revisiting-the-blackphone-and-its-cloudy-future/&quot;&gt;a certain Android device I used&lt;/a&gt; in 2015 and 2016, along with SMS and MMS message metadata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li data-thumb=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/callog-150x150.jpg&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/callog.jpg&quot; data-responsive=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/callog.jpg 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/callog.jpg 2560&quot; data-sub-html=&quot;#caption-1281685&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Calls I made to my office number to check my voicemail, and from my office number to find my phone, found in my Facebook data archive. In total, there were two years of call data, from the period I used my Blackphone as my primary phone.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-thumb=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/getyourfbdata-150x150.jpg&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/getyourfbdata.jpg&quot; data-responsive=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/getyourfbdata.jpg 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/getyourfbdata.jpg 2560&quot; data-sub-html=&quot;#caption-1281681&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;To retrieve a .zip file of your Facebook data, go to the Settings page on Facebook and click the link circled in this screen shot.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to an email inquiry about this data gathering by Ars, a Facebook spokesperson replied, &quot;The most important part of apps and services that help you make connections is to make it easy to find the people you want to connect with. So, the first time you sign in on your phone to a messaging or social app, it's a widely used practice to begin by uploading your phone contacts.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spokesperson pointed out that contact uploading is optional and installation of the application explicitly requests permission to access contacts. And users can delete contact data from their profiles using a tool accessible via Web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook uses phone-contact data as part of its friend recommendation algorithm. And in recent versions of the Messenger application for Android and Facebook Lite devices, a more explicit request is made to users for access to call logs and SMS logs on Android and Facebook Lite devices. But even if users didn't give that permission to Messenger, they may have given it inadvertently for years through Facebook's mobile apps—because of the way Android has handled permissions for accessing call logs in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you granted &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#READ_CONTACTS&quot;&gt;permission to read contacts during Facebook's installation on Android&lt;/a&gt; a few versions ago—specifically before Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean)—that permission also granted Facebook access to call and message logs by default. The permission structure was changed in the Android API in version 16. But Android applications could bypass this change if they were written to earlier versions of the API, so Facebook API could continue to gain access to call and SMS data by specifying an earlier Android SDK version. Google deprecated version 4.0 of the Android API in October 2017—the point at which the latest call metadata in Facebook user's data was found. Apple iOS has never allowed silent access to call data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook provides a way for users to purge collected contact data from their accounts, but it's not clear if this deletes just contacts or if it also purges call and SMS metadata. After purging my contact data, my contacts and calls were still in the archive I downloaded the next day—though this may be because the archive was still the same cache I had requested on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, if you're really concerned about privacy, you should not share address book and call-log data with any mobile application. And you may want to examine the rest of what can be found in the downloadable Facebook archive, as it includes all the advertisers that Facebook has shared your contact information with, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook was warned about app permissions in 2011</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/24/facebook-was-warned-about-app-permissions-in-2011/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/24/facebook-was-warned-about-app-permissions-in-2011/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Who’s to blame for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/17/trump-campaign-linked-data-firm-cambridge-analytica-reportedly-collected-info-on-50m-facebook-profiles/&quot;&gt;leaking of 50 million Facebook users’ data&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/facebook/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;facebook&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg broke several days of silence in the face of a raging privacy storm to go on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v18dGTpzUCM&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; this week to say he was sorry. He also admitted the company had made mistakes; said it had breached the trust of users; and said he regretted not telling Facebookers at the time their information had been misappropriated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, shares in the company have been taking a battering. And Facebook is now facing &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/23/facebook-hit-with-shareholder-lawsuits-over-data-misuse-crisis/&quot;&gt;multiple shareholder and user lawsuits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressed on why he didn’t inform users, in 2015, when Facebook says it found out about this policy breach, Zuckerberg avoided a direct answer — instead fixing on what the company did (asked &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cambridge-analytica/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;cambridge-analytica&quot;&gt;Cambridge Analytica&lt;/a&gt; and the developer whose app was used to suck out data to delete the data) — rather than explaining the thinking behind the thing it did not do (tell affected Facebook users their personal information had been misappropriated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially Facebook’s line is that it believed the data had been deleted — and presumably, therefore, it calculated (wrongly) that it didn’t need to inform users because it had made the leak problem go away via its own backchannels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except of course it hadn’t. Because people who want to do nefarious things with data rarely play exactly by your rules just because you ask them to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s an interesting parallel here with &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/21/uber-data-breach-from-2016-affected-57-million-riders-and-drivers/&quot;&gt;Uber’s response to a 2016 data breach&lt;/a&gt; of its systems. In that case, instead of informing the ~57M affected users and drivers that their personal data had been compromised, Uber’s senior management also decided to try and make the problem go away — by asking (and in their case paying) hackers to delete the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aka the trigger response for both tech companies to massive &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/data-protection/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;data-protection&quot;&gt;data protection&lt;/a&gt; fuck-ups was: Cover up; don’t disclose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook denies the Cambridge Analytica instance is a &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;breach&lt;/em&gt; — because, well, its systems were so laxly designed as to actively encourage vast amounts of data to be sucked out, via API, without the check and balance of those third parties having to gain individual level consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in that sense Facebook is entirely right; technically what Cambridge Analytica did wasn’t a breach at all. It was a feature, not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly that’s also the opposite of reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Facebook and Uber are companies whose businesses rely entirely on users trusting them to safeguard personal data. The disconnect here is gapingly obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s also crystal clear is that rules and systems designed to &lt;em&gt;protect and control&lt;/em&gt; personal data, combined with &lt;em&gt;active enforcement&lt;/em&gt; of those rules and robust security to safeguard systems, are absolutely essential to prevent people’s information being misused at scale in today’s hyperconnected era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before you say hindsight is 20/20 vision, &lt;span&gt;the history of this epic Facebook privacy fail is even longer than the under-disclosed events of 2015 suggest — i.e. when Facebook claims it found out about the breach as a result of investigations by journalists.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the company very clearly turned a blind eye to is the risk posed by its own system of loose app permissions that in turn enabled developers to suck out vast amounts of data without having to worry about pesky user consent. And, ultimately, for Cambridge Analytica to get its hands on the profiles of ~50M US Facebookers for dark ad political targeting purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/privacy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;privacy&quot;&gt;privacy&lt;/a&gt; campaigner and lawyer Max Schrems — a &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/01/facebook-forced-by-privacy-activist-to-put-policy-changes-up-for-worldwide-vote/&quot;&gt;long time critic of Facebook&lt;/a&gt; — was actually raising concerns about the Facebook’s lax attitude to data protection and app permissions as long ago as 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, in August 2011 Schrems filed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.europe-v-facebook.org/Complaint_13_Applications.pdf&quot;&gt;a complaint&lt;/a&gt; with the Irish Data Protection Commission exactly flagging the app permissions data sinkhole (Ireland being the focal point for the complaint because that’s where Facebook’s European HQ is based).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[T]his means that not the data subject but “friends” of the data subject are consenting to the use of personal data,” wrote Schrems in the 2011 complaint, fleshing out consent concerns with Facebook’s friends’ data API. “Since an average facebook user has 130 friends, it is very likely that only one of the user’s friends is installing some kind of spam or phishing application and is consenting to the use of all data of the data subject. There are many applications that do not need to access the users’ friends personal data (e.g. games, quizzes, apps that only post things on the user’s page) but Facebook Ireland does not offer a more limited level of access than “all the basic information of all friends”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The data subject is not given an unambiguous consent to the processing of personal data by applications (no opt-in). Even if a data subject is aware of this entire process, the data subject cannot foresee which application of which developer will be using which personal data in the future. Any form of consent can therefore never be specific,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of Schrems’ complaint, the Irish DPC &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.europe-v-facebook.org/Facebook_Ireland_Audit_Report_Final.pdf&quot;&gt;audited&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.europe-v-facebook.org/ODPC_Review.pdf&quot;&gt;re-audited&lt;/a&gt; Facebook’s systems in 2011 and 2012. The result of those data audits included a recommendation that Facebook tighten app permissions on its platform, according to a spokesman for the Irish DPC, who we spoke to this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spokesman said the DPC’s recommendation formed the basis of the major platform change &lt;a href=&quot;https://beta.techcrunch.com/2014/05/02/f8/?_ga=2.27993406.364962070.1521621827-362044370.1515940976&quot;&gt;Facebook announced in 2014&lt;/a&gt; — aka &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/28/facebook-api-shut-down/&quot;&gt;shutting down the Friends data API&lt;/a&gt; — albeit too late to prevent Cambridge Analytica from being able to harvest millions of profiles’ worth of personal data via a survey app because Facebook only made the change gradually, finally closing the door in May 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Following the re-audit… one of the recommendations we made was in the area of the ability to use friends data through social media,” the DPC spokesman told us. “And that recommendation that we made in 2012, that was implemented by Facebook in 2014 as part of a wider platform change that they made. It’s that change that they made that means that the Cambridge Analytica thing cannot happen today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They made the platform change in 2014, their change was for anybody new coming onto the platform from 1st May 2014 they couldn’t do this. They gave a 12 month period for existing users to migrate across to their new platform… and it was in that period that… Cambridge Analytica’s use of the information for their data emerged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But from 2015 — for absolutely everybody — this issue with CA cannot happen now. And that was following our recommendation that we made in 2012.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given his 2011 complaint about Facebook’s expansive and abusive historical app permissions, Schrems has this week raised an eyebrow and expressed surprise at Zuckerberg’s claim to be “outraged” by the Cambridge Analytica revelations — now snowballing into a massive privacy scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://noyb.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Media-Update-Cambridge-Analytica-en.pdf&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; reflecting on developments he writes: “Facebook has millions of times illegally distributed data of its users to various dodgy apps — without the consent of those affected. In 2011 we sent a legal complaint to the Irish Data Protection Commissioner on this. Facebook argued that this data transfer is perfectly legal and no changes were made. Now after the outrage surrounding Cambridge Analytica the Internet giant suddenly feels betrayed seven years later. Our records show: Facebook knew about this betrayal for years and previously argues that these practices are perfectly legal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why did it take Facebook from September 2012 — when the DPC made its recommendations — until May 2014 and May 2015 to implement the changes and tighten app permissions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator’s spokesman told us it was “engaging” with Facebook over that period of time “to ensure that the change was made”. But he also said Facebook spent some time pushing back — questioning why changes to app permissions were necessary and dragging its feet on shuttering the friends’ data API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think the reality is Facebook had questions as to whether they felt there was a need for them to make the changes that we were recommending,” said the spokesman. “And that was, I suppose, the level of engagement that we had with them. Because we were relatively strong that we felt yes we made the recommendation because we felt the change needed to be made. And that was the nature of the discussion. And as I say ultimately, ultimately the reality is that the change has been made. And it’s been made to an extent that such an issue couldn’t occur today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That is a matter for Facebook themselves to answer as to why they took that period of time,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course we asked Facebook why it pushed back against the DPC’s recommendation in September 2012 — and whether it regrets not acting more swiftly to implement the changes to its APIs, given the crisis its business is now faced having breached user trust by failing to safeguard people’s data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also asked why Facebook users should trust Zuckerberg’s claim, also made in the CNN interview, that it’s now ‘open to being regulated’ — when its historical playbook is packed with examples of the polar opposite behavior, including ongoing &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/25/facebooks-least-favorite-austrian-can-now-press-privacy-suit-in-vienna/&quot;&gt;attempts to circumvent existing EU privacy rules&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Facebook spokeswoman acknowledged receipt of our questions this week — but the company has not responded to any of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DPCIreland/status/976887241204289542&quot;&gt;Irish DPC chief, Helen Dixon, also went on CNN&lt;/a&gt; this week to give her response to the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data misuse crisis — calling for assurances from Facebook that it will properly police its own data protection policies in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even where Facebook have terms and policies in place for app developers, it doesn’t necessarily give us the assurance that those app developers are abiding by the policies Facebook have set, and that Facebook is active in terms of overseeing that there’s no leakage of personal data. And that conditions, such as the prohibition on selling on data to further third parties is being adhered to by app developers,” said Dixon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So I suppose what we want to see change and what we want to oversee with Facebook now and what we’re demanding answers from Facebook in relation to, is first of all what pre-clearance and what pre-authorization do they do before permitting app developers onto their platform. And secondly, once those app developers are operative and have apps collecting personal data what kind of follow up and active oversight steps does Facebook take to give us all reassurance that the type of issue that appears to have occurred in relation to Cambridge Analytica won’t happen again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefighting the raging privacy crisis, Zuckerberg has committed to conducting a historical audit of every app that had access to “a large amount” of user data around the time that Cambridge Analytica was able to harvest so much data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it remains to be seen what other data misuses Facebook will unearth — and have to confess to now, long after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But any other embarrassing data leaks will sit within the same unfortunate context — which is to say that Facebook &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have prevented these problems if it had listened to the very valid concerns data protection experts were raising more than six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, it chose to drag its feet. And the list of awkward questions for the Facebook CEO keeps getting longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap mqw&quot;&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;ark Zuckerberg, the founder and C.E.O. of Facebook, admitted recently his company knew, in 2015, that the data firm Cambridge Analytica, which assisted with Donald Trump’s election campaign, had improperly acquired information on 50 million Facebook users. “This was a breach of trust,” Zuckerberg said, in a Facebook &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104712037900071&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;. “We need to fix that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s not the only thing Facebook needs to fix. “The problem with Facebook is not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; the loss of your privacy and the fact that it can be used as a totalitarian panopticon,” said François Chollet, an artificial intelligence and machine learning software engineer at Google DeepMind, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/976563870322999296&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. “The more worrying issue, in my opinion, is its use of digital information consumption as a psychological control vector.” He elaborated on this point in a thread that’s been shared thousands of times. I caught it when global-surveillance critic and &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt; writer Glenn Greenwald &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/976825393960378368&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;quote-retweeted&lt;/a&gt; Chollet, calling it a “great thread” on “Facebook’s menacing use” of psychology-manipulating A.I. “But remember,” Greenwald added, “Google is also a major exploiter of artificial intelligence with very little transparency or public oversight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chollet bristled at this. “This is the laziest kind of thinking—just because two things share some superficial similarity (they’re large tech [companies]) doesn’t mean they’re equivalent,” he &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/976783608219279360&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. Why? Look to the Newsfeed, Facebook’s signature feature, Chollet went on, in this Twitter thread. “If Facebook gets to decide, over the span of many years, which news you will see (real or fake), whose political status updates you’ll see, and who will see yours, then Facebook is, in effect, in control of your political beliefs and your worldview.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fil Menczer, Professor of Informatics and Computer Science at Indiana University, told &lt;em&gt;Nautilus&lt;/em&gt;, in a discussion about his &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6380/1094&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;work on fake news&lt;/a&gt;, that the algorithms used on social media platforms, like Facebook, bias our decision-making in ways that exploit our socio-cognitive biases—but search engines like Google &lt;a href=&quot;http://nautil.us/issue/52/the-hive/modern-media-is-a-dos-attack-on-your-free-will&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;aren’t entirely innocent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull-quote&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Zuckerberg is morally bankrupt, he’s trying to hide it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The algorithmic biases feed into social and cognitive biases, like confirmation bias, which in turn feed into the algorithmic biases. Before, people were looking at the evening news on TV, or reading the local paper, for example. But the fact that the medium has changed to online social networks, where you shape the sources of information to which you are exposed, now means that you become even more vulnerable,” he said. “Search engines and social media, for example, try to predict what content may be most engaging for someone. Ranking algorithms use popularity as one of the ingredients in their formulas. That means that the more people in your group interact or engage with a piece of fake news, the more likely you are to see it. The social network can act as an amplifier because the people near you have opinions similar to you, so they are more likely to be tricked by a certain kind of fake news, which means you are more likely to see it, too.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.nautil.us/14406_793aaa24e931c05d077f434e33485574.png&quot; width=&quot;733&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;François Chollet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Image from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeheTiBJ0Io&quot;&gt;Google Developers / YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Chollet, though, the sort of danger Facebook poses is unique. “There’s only one company where the product is an opaque algorithmic newsfeed, that has been running large-scale mood/opinion manipulation experiments, that is neck-deep in an election manipulation scandal, that has shown time and time again to have morally bankrupt leadership. Essentially nothing about the threat described applies to Google. Nor Amazon. Nor Apple. It could apply to Twitter, in principle, but in practice it almost entirely doesn’t,” he &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/976784465245515776&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. What seems to clinch it for him is that Facebook is ambitiously pursuing advances in A.I. “What do you use AI…for, when your product is a newsfeed?” he &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/976569278328549378&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wondered&lt;/a&gt;. “Personally, it really scares me. If you work in A.I., please don’t help them. Don’t play their game. Don’t participate in their research ecosystem. Please show some conscience.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He takes the decision to work for his current employer, Alphabet—former motto “Don’t be evil,” and now “Do the right thing”—as a demonstration of scrupulousness. “For me, working at Google”—an Alphabet subsidiary—“is a deliberate choice,” he &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/976786099254181888&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. “If I start feeling uncomfortable, I’ll definitely leave. If I had been working at [Facebook], I would have left in 2017.” For now, he’s glad to labor for a company whose products—like Gmail and Android—are “anti-Facebook,” he &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/976935081817251840&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;went on&lt;/a&gt;. These empower people, while Facebook’s Newsfeed “seeks to maximally waste your time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Zuckerberg is morally bankrupt, he’s trying to hide it. On Wednesday, he told CNN that he’d be “happy to” to testify to Congress and, on Facebook, announced several changes that will, supposedly, rectify what went wrong with the Cambridge Analytica data-breach scandal. “I started Facebook,” he wrote, “and at the end of the day I’m responsible for what happens on our platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is worth keeping in mind, though: That, also at the end of the day, “The motivation for Facebook is not to make you a better person—to improve you morally or intellectually—and it’s not even designed to improve your social group,” Simon DeDeo, an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University, where he runs the Laboratory for Social Minds, and external faculty at the Santa Fe Institute, &lt;a href=&quot;http://nautil.us/issue/12/feedback/ingenious-simon-dedeo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Nautilus&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s designed to make money, to show you things you want to see to hopefully induce you to purchase things.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Sex Workers Say Porn on Google Drive Is Suddenly Disappearing</title>
<link>https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/9kgwnp/porn-on-google-drive-error</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/9kgwnp/porn-on-google-drive-error</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Porn performer &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Avey_Moon&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Avey Moon&lt;/a&gt; was trying to send the lucky winner of her Chaturbate contest his prize—one of her videos, titled &quot;POV Blowjob&quot;—through her Google Drive account. But it wouldn’t send, and Google wasn’t telling her why.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I thought there was something wrong with my file and I got rather worried,” Moon told me in a Twitter message. “I had promised this guy his content and he was so good to me. I was panicked because I thought if I couldn't give him his prize, he would feel like he got ripped off and never come back again or worse, he could actually file a complaint with Chaturbate about me and they can take money from me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She’s not alone. Six porn performers I talked to and more on social media said that they suddenly can't download adult content they keep on Google Drive. They also said they can't a share that content with other accounts or send to clients. In some cases, the adult content is disappearing from Drive without warning or explanation. The porn performers I talked to started sounding the alarm on Twitter last week. They said that Google Drive no longer seemed sex-trade friendly, detailing error messages and sharing cloud storage alternatives with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked about sexual content being blocked on Drive, a spokesperson for Google directed me to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/docs/answer/148505?hl=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Drive policy page&lt;/a&gt;—specifically the section on sexually explicit material, which says, “Do not publish sexually explicit or pornographic images or videos.... Additionally, we do not allow content that drives traffic to commercial pornography.” Writing about porn and sex is permitted, the policy states, as long as it’s not accompanied by sexually explicit images or videos. According to Google, Drive uses a combination of automated systems and manual review to decide what’s in violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__pull-quote&quot;&gt;“It's very oppressive. And it's making my job hellish.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I heard randomly that someone got one piece of their adult content flagged, that was stored on Google Drive,” adult performer &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MelodyKush/status/974323910002069509&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Melody Kush&lt;/a&gt; told me in Twitter direct messages. She’s been using Google Drive for most of the last five and a half years she’s worked as a performer full-time, but started using it more heavily for work in the last three years. “I didn't think anything of it. Then I heard it again, different person. Then it happened to me.” She said she tried to send a video to a client that she’d successfully sent to one other person before, but this time, she received an error message, saying that the item may violate Google's Terms of Service, with a link to request a review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video title contained the phrase “cum show,” which Kush suspected triggered the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But unlike Kush and Moon, others have gotten this error on videos even when the title isn’t explicit. “It's just the content, which is the strange part,” adult performer &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Stonedsexy66&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lilly Stone&lt;/a&gt; told me in a Twitter direct message. Her Drive account contains mostly adult content, but her images aren’t affected by this error—only videos, some of which have begun to disappear without warning or explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/zmz3yw/why-is-my-google-doc-locked-terms-of-service-bug&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Docs Is Randomly Flagging Files for Violating its Terms of Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It seems like all of our videos in Google Drive are getting flagged by some sort of automated system,” Stone said. “We're not even really getting notified of it, the only way we really found out was one of our customers told us he couldn't view or download the video we sent him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stone’s files aren’t removed from Drive, but when she tries to play the video or download it, she said Google gives her an error message: &quot;Whoops! There was a problem playing this video” with an option to download the item, but the download link doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some sex workers are wondering if this has something to do with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/neqxaw/sex-trafficking-bill-sesta-fosta-vote&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;impending vote on the SESTA-FOSTA bill&lt;/a&gt;, which is on the Senate floor for debate this week. Performer Hailey Heartless told me that she’s not sure if it’s a “blitz” that Google is doing, or if it’s just something many sex workers noticed at once, and got the conversation started—but she’s heard from dozens of people in the industry about the issue, after tweeting about her own experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could also be that Google is simply, suddenly, deciding to enforce its Terms of Service. The fact remains that Google Drive is either glitching out and impacting people’s livelihoods, or suddenly enforcing its Terms of Service without warning. Adult performer &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RamonaFlour/status/974377170675032064&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ramona Flour&lt;/a&gt; told me in an email that she’s been using a paid version of Drive with 1 TB of storage, which costs $9.99 a month, for five years, but she just started getting error messages last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It's very oppressive. And it's making my job hellish,” Moon told me. “I'm still stressing about finding a way around this. I don't believe that Google should be allowed to dictate what you and another consenting adult send to each other through email.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Fred&amp;#039;s ImageMagick Scripts</title>
<link>http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/index.php</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/index.php</guid>
<description>
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Detailed information and examples are available for each script on separate pages linked above and below as well as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/script_list.txt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;summary list&lt;/a&gt; of them all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can also try many of them in an interactive environment at &lt;a href=&quot;http://jqmagick.imagemagick.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JqMagic&lt;/a&gt;. This is a collaborative effort with Jd Audibert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To download a script, go the examples page for that script and simply click on the link. The links are controlled by a counter script and are set to download automatically upon a single left button click.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These scripts are bash unix shell scripts and should work on Linux and Mac OSX with IM 6.3.5.0 or higher. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note that they were not designed for multi-page/multi-layer/multi-frame images&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Pointers for use:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be sure you have installed the unix calculator, bc. It is an option that you may have to select when installing unix.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the script&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the name to remove the suffix .dms (if it exists) and optionally replace with .sh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the script to executable (chmod u+x)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the full path to where IM (convert) resides by typing in a shell terminal window: type -a convert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If type -a convert returns more than one path, type in a shell terminal window: path2/convert -version, where path2 is each of the paths found. Decide which version of IM you want to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modify your PATH environment variable so that it includes the full path to where IM (convert) resides (often /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin). This can be done by editing your .profile file.&lt;br/&gt;Alternately, edit the script somewhere between the comments and the first use of any IM command, such as just below the defaults section to add the following two lines:&lt;br/&gt;imdir=&quot;path2&quot; #(such as imdir=&quot;/usr/local/bin&quot; or imdir=&quot;/usr/bin&quot;)&lt;br/&gt;PATH=&quot;${imdir}:${PATH}&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open a shell terminal window&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SYNTAX: bash /fullpathto/scriptname(.sh) arguments /fullpathto/inputimage /fullpathto/outputimage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To avoid the bash and just use scriptname(.sh) ... set your PATH to contain the location of the script. I strongly suggest you create a directory to contain all my scripts and put the path to that directory in your PATH environment variable. That will also avoid issues for scripts that make calls to any of my other scripts and also messages regarding locating my scripts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optionally edit the script to change the default directory (found after the defaults section) from dir=&quot;.&quot; to dir=&quot;/tmp&quot; and be sure it has read/write permissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have trouble with filenames with spaces in them, then you will need to edit the script in several places until I have time to review and fix all my scripts.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find where infile and outfile (maskfile or any others) are defined at the end of the argument trapping section. Make sure to enclose in double quotes any declarations of those files that include $1, $2, etc, such as infile=&quot;$1&quot;, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find any occurrences of $infile or $outfile and enclose them in double quotes as &quot;$infile&quot;, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On some Linux systems, there may be an issue with duplicate lines of documentation when using the -help option. If this is the case, try changing the following two lines in functions usage1() and usage2(), respectively, just below the commented section at the top of the script as follows (suggested by Stefan Vorkoetter and Ted Baker):&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;sed &amp;gt;&amp;amp;2 -e '1,/^####/d; /^###/g; /^#/!q; s/^#//; s/^ //; 4,$p' &quot;$PROGDIR/$PROGNAME&quot;&lt;br/&gt;To:&lt;br/&gt;sed -e '1,/^####$/d; /^###$/,$d; s/^#//; s/^ //' &quot;$PROGDIR/$PROGNAME&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sed &amp;gt;&amp;amp;2 -e '1,/^####/d; /^######/g; /^#/!q; s/^#*//; s/^ //; 4,$p' &quot;$PROGDIR/$PROGNAME&quot;&lt;br/&gt;To:&lt;br/&gt;sed -e '1,/^####$/d; /^######$/,$d; s/^#*//; s/^ //' &quot;$PROGDIR/$PROGNAME&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;or&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;sed &amp;gt;&amp;amp;2 -n -e '1,/^####/d; /^###/g; /^#/!q; s/^#//; s/^ //; 4,$p' &quot;$PROGDIR/$PROGNAME&quot;&lt;br/&gt;To:&lt;br/&gt;sed -e '1,/^####$/d; /^###$/,$d; s/^#//; s/^ //' &quot;$PROGDIR/$PROGNAME&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sed &amp;gt;&amp;amp;2 -n -e '1,/^####/d; /^######/g; /^#/!q; s/^#*//; s/^ //; 4,$p' &quot;$PROGDIR/$PROGNAME&quot;&lt;br/&gt;To:&lt;br/&gt;sed -e '1,/^####$/d; /^######$/,$d; s/^#*//; s/^ //' &quot;$PROGDIR/$PROGNAME&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;These scripts can be used with PHP exec command.&lt;p&gt;Pointers for use:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be sure you have installed the unix calculator, bc. It is an option that you may have to select when installing unix.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the script&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the name to remove the suffix .dms (if it exists) and optionally replace with .sh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the script to executable (chmod u+x)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the full path to where IM (convert) resides by typing in a shell terminal window: type -a convert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If type -a convert returns more than one path, type in a shell terminal window: path2/convert -version, where path2 is each of the paths found. Decide which version of IM you want to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modify your PATH environment variable so that it includes the full path to where IM (convert) resides (often /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin). This can be done by editing your .profile file.&lt;br/&gt;Alternately, edit the script somewhere between the comments and the first use of any IM command, such as just below the defaults section to add the following two lines:&lt;br/&gt;imdir=&quot;path2&quot; #(such as imdir=&quot;/usr/local/bin&quot; or imdir=&quot;/usr/bin&quot;)&lt;br/&gt;PATH=&quot;${imdir}:${PATH}&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit the script to change the default directory (found after the defaults section) from dir=&quot;.&quot; to dir=&quot;/tmp&quot; and be sure it has read/write permissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the exec command use bash /fullpathto/scriptname(.sh) arguments /fullpathto/inputimage /fullpathto/outputimage.&lt;br/&gt;Note that &quot;bash&quot; may or may not be necessary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To avoid the bash and just use scriptname(.sh) ... set your PATH to contain the location of the script. I strongly suggest you create a directory to contain all my scripts and put the path to that directory in your PATH environment variable. That will also avoid issues for scripts that make calls to any of my other scripts and also messages regarding locating my scripts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have trouble with filenames with spaces in them, then you will need to edit the script in several places until I have time to review and fix all my scripts.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Find any occurrences of $infile or $outfile and enclose them in double quotes as &quot;$infile&quot;, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows users can run my scripts, if they install the unix Cygwin system for Windows and then install the IM Cygwin binary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Windows 10 (64-bit) users can also run my scripts without the need for Cygwin. Bruce Rusk reports: All that was need was the installation of the Unix bc tool and Imagemagick through apt/apt-get. Everything else worked right out of the box, no changes to PATH variables required. See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;How to Install and Use the Linux Bash Shell on Windows 10&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My earliest scripts were developed under ImageMagick-6.3.5.0 on Mac OS 10.4x. I have tried to keep them updated with changes in IM versions. All were developed using Q16 IM. I do not know how compatible they are to older version of ImageMagick, nor to other Q levels or other versions of Unix.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;NOTE: Starting with IM 6.3.5.7, -matte/+matte were deprecated in favor of -alpha set or on/-alpha off. Therefore, many of my scripts may not work with IM versions prior to that unless replaced with the deprecated syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use at your own risk. The argument testing may not be foolproof nor do I bear any responsibility for any problems that may occur by their use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would like to thank Anthony Thyssen for his patience with all my newbie questions about IM and Unix. His replies were invaluable.&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Look for the duct tape</title>
<link>http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2018/03/23/ducttape/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2018/03/23/ducttape/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been having some wonderful conversations in the real world since resigning and jumping off the merry-go-round. Besides just talking about what happened, why I left, and how to succeed in the &quot;2018 version&quot; of the culture which now exists, I'm also still doing the same mentoring stuff I always did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these conversations have yielded some real gems, and one I had not long ago is no exception. I didn't realize it at first, but it was actually a conversation about how to find interesting things to work on. It started as a simple question: what bugged me about the (X) environment when I was there? What would I change?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally when something bugs me and has outstanding issues, there's this mental laundry list in my head and I can rattle off a few things. But for this, I didn't have anything. I wasn't sure if it was because I've been free for about a month now, but the answers just weren't forthcoming. Still, I tried to give some kind of answer because this person needed direction. If I said &quot;it's all good&quot;, that wouldn't help them at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit of pondering and feeling really bad about not having anything to say, it hit me. I had rigged up a bunch of local tools in my own &quot;bin&quot; directory to do things that the &quot;X&quot; environment did not handle. Those &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; been issues for me, but were no longer, because I had covered the rough edges with my own workarounds. The system now worked in a way that didn't annoy me too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I was able to rattle off a whole bunch of dumb little shell scripts and other tools that I had written over the past 4.5 years to make my life better when operating in that space. This turned out to be a treasure trove of things worth digging into. To think that I almost said that everything was fine and nothing was wrong!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I tried to pop up a level to give a general tenet instead of just a laundry list of dumb things I had worked around, and looking around at the public furniture in the town square, it came to me: look for the duct tape. Look for the patches to the original system which were done by people who actually work in a given space. Track down the sharp edges which have been systematically covered up by users who were more interested in being productive and weren't willing to fight with the owners of the system to get things changed upstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In concrete terms, go around and find out what kind of little one-off tools people have designed. Talk to them and hear their stories. Look in their personal bin directories. Take notes and look for patterns. See if anything stands out, or if anything particularly compelling grabs you during the interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, if you go off and build something new to soften a rough edge, not only do they get to remove the duct tape, but you have a bunch of interested users from day one. Also, just think of the goodwill that is bound to follow when they realize that finally, someone cares about the end-user experience, and is willing to adapt upstream to make their lives better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look for the duct tape.&lt;/p&gt;

The IESG has approved the following document:
- 'The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3'
  (draft-ietf-tls-tls13-28.txt) as Proposed Standard

This document is the product of the Transport Layer Security Working Group.

The IESG contact persons are Kathleen Moriarty and Eric Rescorla.

A URL of this Internet Draft is:
&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-tls13/&quot;&gt;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-tls13/&lt;/a&gt;




Technical Summary

   This document specifies version 1.3 of the Transport Layer Security
   (TLS) protocol.  TLS allows client/server applications to communicate
   over the Internet in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping,
   tampering, and message forgery.

Working Group Summary

  The document is the work product of the members of the TLS
  WG.  There is strong consensus in the working group for this
  document.  The area that was most controversial was around
  the inclusion of a 0-RTT mode that has different security
  properties than the rest of TLS.  s1.3 lists the major differences
  from TLS1.2, as agreed by the contributors; we do not think
  that the RFC needs to list the changes that occurred between
  each draft.

  The draft has had 3 WGLCs to address various issues and the
  chairs assessment was fair in each of these discussions.  At this
  point there are no known outstanding issue.

  While I personally do not agree with inclusion of 0-RTT because
  there are bound to be successful attacks against the mitigations
  in the future, I do agree with the chair's assessment of the WG
  consensus and am pleased with the additional text on mitigating
  the associated risks with 0-RTT.

Document Quality

  There are over 10 interoperable implementations of the
  protocol from different sources written in different
  languages.  The major web browser vendors and TLS
  libraries vendors have draft implementations or have
  indicated they will support the protocol in the future.  In
  addition to having extensive review in the TLS working
  group, the protocol has received unprecedented security
  review by the academic community.  Several TRON (TLS
  Ready or Not) conferences were held with academic
  community to give them a chance to present their
  findings for TLS.  This has resulted in improvements to
  the protocol.  There was also much consideration and 
  discussion around any contentious points, resolved through
  polls and working group last calls.

  Please note that ID-nits complains about the obsoleted/
  updated RFCs not being listed in the abstract. This is
  intentional because the abstract is now a concise and
  comprehensive overview and is free form citations, as
  per RFC7322.

<description>&lt;p&gt;EVERY year in Singapore 1% of pupils in the third year of primary school bring home an envelope headed “On government service”. Inside is an invitation to the city-state’s Gifted Education Programme. To receive the overture, pupils must ace tests in maths, English and “general ability”. If their parents accept the offer, the children are taught using a special curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore’s approach is emblematic of the traditional form of “gifted” education, one that uses intelligence tests with strict thresholds to identify children with seemingly innate ability. Yet in many countries it is being overhauled in two main ways. The first is that educationists are using a broader range of methods to identify highly intelligent children, especially those from poor households. The second is an increasing focus on fostering the attitudes and personality traits found in successful people in an array of disciplines—including those who did not ace intelligence tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New research lies behind these shifts. It shows that countries which do not get the most from their best and brightest face big economic costs. The research also suggests that the nature-or-nurture debate is a false dichotomy. Intelligence is highly heritable and perhaps the best predictor of success. But it is far from the only characteristic that matters for future eminence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of gifted children goes back at least a century. In 1916 Leta Hollingworth—a psychologist whose doctorate refuted the idea that women struggled at science because of destabilising menstrual cycles—began some of the earliest research on children with high IQs. Two decades later she started work at the Speyer School in New York City, one of the first schools with a challenging curriculum for these pupils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;xhead&quot;&gt;Like, really smart&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IQ tests have attracted furious criticism. Speaking for the sceptics, Christopher Hitchens, a journalist, argued that: “There is...an unusually high and consistent correlation between the stupidity of a given person and [his] propensity to be impressed by the measurement of IQ.” Like any assessment, IQ tests are not perfect. But as Stuart Ritchie of the University of Edinburgh points out in “Intelligence”, researchers in cognitive science agree that general intelligence—not book-learning but the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly and so on—is an identifiable and important attribute which can be measured by IQ tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just how important is suggested by the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY), founded in 1971. Julian Stanley, then a psychologist at Johns Hopkins University, over 25 years recruited 5,000 precocious children, each of whom had intelligence-test scores in early adolescence high enough to gain entry to university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research into how these children did in adulthood has emerged over the past two decades. Of the SMPY participants who scored among the top 0.5% for their age-group in maths and verbal tests, 30% went on to earn a doctorate, versus 1% of Americans as a whole. These children were also much more likely to have high incomes and to file patents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is variation even among the top scorers (see chart). This runs contrary to the idea, proposed by some psychologists, that there is a ceiling to IQ, after which its influence wanes. Of the top 0.01% of children, 50% went on to earn a PhD, medical or law degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Findings from studies led by Ian Deary of the University of Edinburgh, meanwhile, undermine the idea that gifted children go on to become disproportionately troubled. There are of course exceptions. But on average having a high IQ as a child is associated with better physical and mental health as an adult. Being moved up a school-year, as many are, tends to do them little harm. SMPY pupils who skipped at least one grade were 60% more likely to file patents than those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials often cite the SMPY as the inspiration for the creation in 2014 of two specialist maths schools in England. Based on the Kolmogorov School in Moscow, these schools accept only those pupils who excel in maths at exams at age 16. In January the government said it wanted to open more as part of its “industrial strategy”, a plan to boost Britain’s woeful productivity growth. Linking gifted education to economic growth may horrify some people. But it has long seemed like common sense in countries without many natural resources, such as Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, however, the potential of poor bright children is often wasted. In December Raj Chetty of Stanford University and colleagues published a paper lamenting “lost Einsteins”. They found that children who score in the top 5% of standardised tests in the third year of primary school are many times more likely than the other 95% to file patents in later life. But the likelihood is still much greater among smart kids from rich families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philippe Aghion of the London School of Economics and colleagues found similar results in Finland. Those with high IQs but from poor backgrounds were especially at risk of not fulfilling their potential. That is not only unfair. It also implies that a lot of talent, which could have been harnessed to cure diseases or design better toasters, is being squandered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons why poor-but-smart children struggle. Yet gifted schemes have often not helped. When applications are voluntary, they come mostly from rich or pushy parents. In New York City, for example, tutoring companies often charge $200 per hour to help four-year-olds prepare for admissions tests for gifted-education programmes starting in kindergarten. Tutoring may temporarily bump up scores by only a few points, but that can make all the difference. In 2015 70% of pupils admitted to such programmes were white or Asian, though they represent just 30% of the school-age population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It helps when schools test every child, rather than rely on parents to put children forward. In a paper from 2015, economists David Card and Laura Giuliano found that when a school district in Florida introduced universal screening for its gifted-education scheme, admissions increased by 180% among poor children, 130% among Hispanics and 80% for black pupils. (Admissions among white children fell.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some programmes go further. Miami-Dade, America’s fourth-largest school district, uses universal screening. It has a lower IQ threshold for poor children or those for whom English is a second language, so long as they show other signs of promise, such as learning English quickly or high scores in other tests. In Miami-Dade 6.9% of black pupils are in the gifted programme, versus 2.4% and 3.6% in Florida as a whole and nationwide respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In America 48 out of 50 states have programmes for brainy children, but in the decade before 2013, 24 redefined them, typically ditching the “gifted” label in favour of “high-ability”. Today no state relies on a single IQ score to select students. In his book “Ungifted” Scott Barry Kaufman of the University of Pennsylvania calls this a “huge change from just 20 years ago”. European countries have seen similar shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School districts are also testing for other attributes, including spatial ability (ie, the capacity to generate, manipulate and store visual images). Jonathan Wai, a psychologist, notes that spatial ability as a child is strongly linked to achievement in science and technology in later life. The Finnish study also found this. But it is less correlated with income during childhood than are verbal and mathematical scores. So testing for it gives talented poor children a better chance to shine, says Mr Wai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;xhead&quot;&gt;The power of persistence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other researchers worry, though, that no matter how good the selection process, relying only on measures of intelligence will fail to find children with the potential to excel in adult life. Psychologists such as Mr Kaufman argue that there are many more possible paths to success in adulthood than often assumed, and that education must do more to foster attributes such as passion, determination and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether termed “grit”, “task-motivation” or “conscientiousness”, more psychologists are emphasising the role of persistence. “As much as talent counts, effort counts twice,” writes Angela Duckworth of the University of Pennsylvania, in “Grit”, published in 2016. For Anders Ericsson of Florida State University, deliberate practice over a long period (popularly understood as 10,000 hours) is critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such statements are simplistic. But few researchers disagree with the idea that talent requires development, and that should involve promoting hard work as well as intelligence. Gifted programmes from Singapore’s to England’s specialist maths schools make it a priority to help children pursue their passion. Robotics prodigies, for example, may be given the opportunity to shadow university students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is evidence that aspects of gifted education should influence education more broadly. Project Bright Idea, developed at Duke University, saw 10,000 typical nursery and primary-school pupils taught using methods often reserved for brainier kids—fostering high expectations, complex problem-solving and cultivating meta-cognition (or “thinking about thinking”). Nearly every one of them went on to do much better on tests than similar peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some researchers go further. Carol Dweck of Stanford University emphasises children’s “mindset” (the beliefs they have about learning). Children who think they can change their intelligence have a “growth mindset”, she says. Those who believe they cannot do much to change their “D” grades have a “fixed” one. According to Ms Dweck, children who adopt the first mindset quickly start to do better in tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teaching methods that draw on Ms Dweck’s work are now found in schools across Britain and America. The World Bank is running trials of the approach in countries such as Peru. One technique, for example, might see a pupil told to add the word “yet” to their statements, as in “I can’t do long-division—yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a recent meta-analysis suggests that interventions based on growth-mindset are less effective than their hype implies. The study suggests that the effects of interventions drawing on the idea have no effect on the typical student’s outcomes and at best a small effect on those of poorer students. Other psychologists have struggled to replicate Ms Dweck’s results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that intelligence is highly malleable also jars with research on its heritability. Studies led by Robert Plomin of King’s College London suggest that roughly 50% of the variance in IQ scores is due to genetic differences. These findings do not dismiss the role of nurture; hard work and social background matter. But they undermine the idea that supreme intelligence can simply be willed into being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A broader approach to gifted education ensures that more children reach their potential. But the evidence suggests that, so long as they are open to everyone, IQ tests still have a vital role to play. To find lost Einsteins, you have to look for them.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Managing database schema changes without downtime</title>
<link>https://samsaffron.com/archive/2018/03/22/managing-db-schema-changes-without-downtime</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://samsaffron.com/archive/2018/03/22/managing-db-schema-changes-without-downtime</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;How we manage schema changes at Discourse minimizing downtime&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Discourse we have always been huge fans of &lt;a href=&quot;https://samsaffron.com/archive/2013/02/22/do-you-smoke-test&quot;&gt;continuous deployment&lt;/a&gt;. Every commit we make heads to our continuous integration test suite. If all the tests pass (ui, unit, integration, smoke) we automatically deploy the latest version of our code to &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.discourse.org&quot;&gt;https://meta.discourse.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern and practice we follow allows the thousands self-installers out there to safely upgrade to the &lt;code&gt;tests-passed&lt;/code&gt; version whenever they feel like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we deploy so often we need to take extra care not to have any outages during deployments. One of the most common reasons for outages during application deployment is database schema changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The problem with schema changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our current deployment mechanism roughly goes as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Migrate database to new schema&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bundle up application into a single docker image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push to registry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spin down old instance, pull new instance, spin up new instance (and repeat)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we ever create an &lt;strong&gt;incompatible&lt;/strong&gt; database schema we risk breaking all the old application instances running older versions of our code. In practice, this can lead to tens of minutes of outage! &lt;img src=&quot;https://discuss.samsaffron.com/images/emoji/twitter/boom.png?v=5&quot; title=&quot;:boom:&quot; class=&quot;emoji&quot; alt=&quot;:boom:&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ActiveRecord the situation is particularly dire cause in production the database schema is cached and any changes in schema that drop or rename columns very quickly risk breaking every query to the affected model raising invalid schema exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years we have introduced various patterns to overcome this problem and enable us to deploy schema changes safely, minimizing outages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tracking rich information about migrations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ActiveRecord has a table called &lt;code&gt;schema_migrations&lt;/code&gt; where is stores information about migrations that ran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the amount of data stored in this table is &lt;strong&gt;extremely limited&lt;/strong&gt;, in fact it boils down to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;lang-auto&quot;&gt;connection.create_table(table_name, id: false) do |t|
  t.string :version, version_options
end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table has a &lt;strong&gt;lonely&lt;/strong&gt; column storing the “version” of migrations that ran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It does not store when the migration ran&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It does not store how long it took the migration to run&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has nothing about the version of Rails that was running when the migration ran&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lack of information, especially, not knowing when stuff ran makes creating clean systems for dealing with schema changes hard to build. Additionally, debugging strange and wonderful issues with migrations is very hard without rich information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discourse, monkey patches Rails to log rich information about migrations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;

  module SchemaMigrationDetails
    def exec_migration(conn, direction)
      rval = nil

      time = Benchmark.measure do
        rval = super
      end

      sql = &amp;lt;&amp;lt;SQL
      INSERT INTO schema_migration_details(
        version,
        hostname,
        name,
        git_version,
        duration,
        direction,
        rails_version,
        created_at
      ) values (

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our patch provides us a very rich details surrounding all the migration circumstances. This really &lt;strong&gt;should be&lt;/strong&gt; in Rails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Defer dropping columns&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we “know” when all previous migrations ran due to our rich migration logging, we are able to “defer drop” columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means is that we can guarantee we perform &lt;strong&gt;dangerous&lt;/strong&gt; schema changes after we know that the new code is in place to handle the schema change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice if we wish to drop a column we &lt;strong&gt;do not&lt;/strong&gt; use migrations for it. Instead our db/seed takes care of defer dropping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;lang-rb&quot;&gt;This file has been truncated. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/6a3c8fe69c16ad7360046f145db6689c18e91005/db/fixtures/009_users.rb#L36-L62&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;show original&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/article&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;lang-rb&quot;&gt;These defer drops will happen at least 30 minutes after the particular migration referenced ran (in the next migration cycle), giving us peace of mind that the new application code is in place.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;lang-rb&quot;&gt;If we wish to rename a column we will create a new column, duplicate the value into the new column, mark the old column readonly using a trigger and defer drop old column.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;lang-rb&quot;&gt;If we wish to drop or rename a table we follow a similar pattern.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;lang-rb&quot;&gt;The logic for defer dropping lives in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/6a3c8fe69c16ad7360046f145db6689c18e91005/lib/migration/column_dropper.rb&quot;&gt;ColumnDropper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/6a3c8fe69c16ad7360046f145db6689c18e91005/lib/migration/table_dropper.rb&quot;&gt;TableDropper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;lang-rb&quot;&gt;Not trusting ourselves&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;lang-rb&quot;&gt;A big problem with spectacular special snowflake per-application practices is enforcement.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;lang-rb&quot;&gt;We have great patterns for ensuring safety, however sometimes people forget that we should never drop a column or a table the ActiveRecord migration way.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;lang-rb&quot;&gt;To ensure we never make the mistake of committing dangerous schema changes into our migrations, we patch the PG gem to disallow certain statements when we run them in the context of a migration.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;lang-rb&quot;&gt;Want to &lt;code&gt;DROP TABLE&lt;/code&gt;? Sorry, an exception will be raised. Want to &lt;code&gt;DROP&lt;/code&gt; a column, an exception will be raised.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes it impractical to commit highly risky schema changes without following our best practices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;lang-nohighlight&quot;&gt;== 20180321015226 DropRandomColumnFromUser: migrating =========================
-- remove_column(:categories, :name)

WARNING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An attempt was made to drop or rename a column in a migration
SQL used was: 'ALTER TABLE &quot;categories&quot; DROP &quot;name&quot;'
Please use the deferred pattrn using Migration::ColumnDropper in db/seeds to drop
or rename columns.

Note, to minimize disruption use self.ignored_columns = [&quot;column name&quot;] on your
ActiveRecord model, this can be removed 6 months or so later.

This protection is in place to protect us against dropping columns that are currently
in use by live applications.

Tasks: TOP =&amp;gt; db:migrate
(See full trace by running task with --trace)

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This logic lives in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/6a3c8fe69c16ad7360046f145db6689c18e91005/lib/migration/safe_migrate.rb&quot;&gt;safe_migrate.rb&lt;/a&gt;. Since this is a recent pattern we only enforce it for migrations after a certain date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Alternatives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of what we do is available in gem form and some is not:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ankane/strong_migrations&quot;&gt;Strong Migrations&lt;/a&gt; offers enforcement. It also takes care of a bunch of interesting conditions like nudging you to create indexes concurrently in postgres. Enforcement is done via patching active record migrator, meaning that if anyone does stuff with SQL direct it will not be caught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/LendingHome/zero_downtime_migrations&quot;&gt;Zero downtime migrations&lt;/a&gt; very similar to strong migrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/instructure/outrigger/blob/master/README.md&quot;&gt;Outrigger&lt;/a&gt; allows you to tag migrations. This enables you to amend your deploy process so some migrations run pre-deploy and some run post-deploy. This is the simplest technique for managing migrations in such a way that you can avoid downtimes during deploy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/procore/handcuffs&quot;&gt;Handcuffs&lt;/a&gt;: very similar to outrigger, define phases for your migrations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What should you do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our current pattern for defer dropping columns and tables works for us, but is not yet ideal. Code that is in charge of “seeding” data now is also in charge of amending schema and timing of column drops is not as tightly controlled as it should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the upside, &lt;code&gt;rake db:migrate&lt;/code&gt; is all you need to run and it works magically all the time. Regardless of how you are hosted and what version your schema is at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My recommendation though for what I would consider best practice here is a mixture of a bunch of ideas. All of it belongs in Rails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Enforcement of best practices belongs in Rails&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think enforcement of safe schema changes should be introduced into ActiveRecord. This is something everyone should be aware of. It is practical to do zero downtime deploys today with schema changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;lang-auto&quot;&gt;class RemoveColumn &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def up
     # this should raise an error
     remove_column :posts, :name
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it work, &lt;strong&gt;everyone&lt;/strong&gt; should be forced to add the &lt;code&gt;after_deploy&lt;/code&gt; flag to the migration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;lang-auto&quot;&gt;class RemoveColumn &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  after_deploy! # either this, or disable the option globally 
  def up
     # this should still raise if class Post has no ignored_columns: [:name]
     remove_column :posts, :name
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;lang-auto&quot;&gt;class RemoveColumn &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  after_deploy!(force: true)
  def up
     # this should work regardless of ignored_columns
     remove_column :posts, :name
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think the ideal enforcement is via SQL analysis, however it is possible that this is a bit of a can-of-worms at Rails scale. For us it is practical cause we only support one database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;rake db:migrate&lt;/code&gt; should continue to work just as it always did.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For backwards compatibility rake db:migrate should run all migrations including &lt;code&gt;after_deploy&lt;/code&gt; migrations. Applications who do not care about “zero downtime deploys” should also be allowed to opt out of the safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New post and pre migrate rake tasks should be introduced&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run all the application code compatible migrations you would run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;lang-auto&quot;&gt;rake db:migrate:pre
# runs all migrations without `after_deploy!`
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run all the destructive operations you would run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;lang-auto&quot;&gt;rake db:migrate:post
# runs all migrations with `after_deploy!`
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to start with “safe” zero downtime deploys today I would recommend:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;-0.39130434782609&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amending build process to run pre deploy migrations and post deploy migrations (via &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/instructure/outrigger/blob/master/README.md&quot;&gt;Outrigger&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/procore/handcuffs&quot;&gt;Handcuffs&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-0.67924528301887&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduce an enforcement piece with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ankane/strong_migrations&quot;&gt;Strong Migrations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Rent out GPUs to AI researchers and make ~2x more than mining cryptocurrencies</title>
<link>https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/86ofw2/_/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/86ofw2/_/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;As a broke college student who is currently studying deep learning and AI, my side projects often require lots of GPUs to train neural networks. Unfortunately the cloud GPU instances from AWS and Google Cloud are &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; expensive (plus my student credits ran out in like 3 days), so the roadblock in a lot of my side projects was my limited access to GPU compute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily for me, I had a friend who was mining Ethereum on his Nvidia 1080 ti's. I would Venmo him double what he was making by mining Ethereum, and in return he would let me train my neural networks on his computer at significantly less than what I would have had to pay AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I thought to myself, &quot;hmm, what if there was an easy way for cryptocurrency miners to rent out their GPUs to AI researchers?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, a lot of the infrastructure to become a mini-cloud provider is pretty much non-existent. So I built &lt;a href=&quot;http://vectordash.com&quot;&gt;Vectordash&lt;/a&gt; - it's a website where can you list your Nvidia GPUs for AI researchers to rent out - sort of like Airbnb but for GPUs. With current earnings, you can make about 3-4x more than you would make by mining the most profitable cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You simply run a desktop client and list how long you plan on keeping your machine online for, and if someone is interested, they can rent it out and you'll get paid for the duration they used it for. You can still mine whatever you like since the desktop client will automatically switch between mining &amp;amp; hosting whenever someone requests to use your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still gauging whether or not GPU miners would be interested in something like this, but as someone who often finds themselves having to pay upwards of $20 per day for GPUs on AWS just for a side project, this would help a bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any specific recommendations, just comment below. I'd love to hear what you guys think!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(and if you're interested in becoming one of the first GPU hosts, please fill out this form - &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/forms/ghFqpayk0fuaXqL92&quot;&gt;https://goo.gl/forms/ghFqpayk0fuaXqL92&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you've filled out the form, I'll be sending an email with installation instructions in the next 1-2 days!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;edit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FAQ:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Are AMD GPUs supported?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the time being, no. Perhaps in the future, but no ETA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Is Windows supported?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the time being, no. Perhaps in the future, but again, no ETA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) When will I be able to host my GPUs on Vectordash?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a few exams to study for this week (and was not expecting this much interest), but the desktop client should be completed very soon. Expect an email in the next couple of days with installation instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) How can I become a host?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've filled out &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/forms/qGlKUT0Zz19WLtcv2&quot;&gt;this form&lt;/a&gt;, then you are set! I'll be sending out an email in the next couple of days with installation instructions. In the meanwhile, feel free to make an account on &lt;a href=&quot;http://vectordash.com&quot;&gt;Vectordash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

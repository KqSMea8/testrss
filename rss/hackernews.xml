<title>Theranos, CEO Holmes, and Former President Balwani Charged with Fraud</title>
<link>https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-41</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-41</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Silicon Valley-based private company Theranos Inc., its founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes, and its former President Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani with raising more than $700 million from investors through an elaborate, years-long fraud in which they exaggerated or made false statements about the company’s technology, business, and financial performance.  Theranos and Holmes have agreed to resolve the charges against them.  Importantly, in addition to a penalty, Holmes has agreed to give up majority voting control over the company, as well as to a reduction of her equity which, combined with shares she previously returned, materially reduces her equity stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaints allege that Theranos, Holmes, and Balwani made numerous false and misleading statements in investor presentations, product demonstrations, and media articles by which they deceived investors into believing that its key product – a portable blood analyzer – could conduct comprehensive blood tests from finger drops of blood, revolutionizing the blood testing industry.  In truth, according to the SEC’s complaint, Theranos’ proprietary analyzer could complete only a small number of tests, and the company conducted the vast majority of patient tests on modified and industry-standard commercial analyzers manufactured by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaints further charge that Theranos, Holmes, and Balwani claimed that Theranos’ products were deployed by the U.S. Department of Defense on the battlefield in Afghanistan and on medevac helicopters and that the company would generate more than $100 million in revenue in 2014.  In truth, Theranos’ technology was never deployed by the U.S. Department of Defense and generated a little more than $100,000 in revenue from operations in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investors are entitled to nothing less than complete truth and candor from companies and their executives,” said Steven Peikin, Co-Director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division.  “The charges against Theranos, Holmes, and Balwani make clear that there is no exemption from the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws simply because a company is non-public, development-stage, or the subject of exuberant media attention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a result of Holmes’ alleged fraudulent conduct, she is being stripped of control of the company she founded, is returning millions of shares to Theranos, and is barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for 10 years,” said Stephanie Avakian, Co-Director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division.  “This package of remedies exemplifies our efforts to impose tailored and meaningful sanctions that directly address the unlawful behavior charged and best remedies the harm done to shareholders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Theranos story is an important lesson for Silicon Valley,” said Jina Choi, Director of the SEC’s San Francisco Regional Office.  “Innovators who seek to revolutionize and disrupt an industry must tell investors the truth about what their technology can do today, not just what they hope it might do someday.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theranos and Holmes have agreed to settle the fraud charges levied against them.  Holmes agreed to pay a $500,000 penalty, be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for 10 years, return the remaining 18.9 million shares that she obtained during the fraud, and relinquish her voting control of Theranos by converting her super-majority Theranos Class B Common shares to Class A Common shares.  Due to the company’s liquidation preference, if Theranos is acquired or is otherwise liquidated, Holmes would not profit from her ownership until – assuming redemption of certain warrants – over $750 million is returned to defrauded investors and other preferred shareholders.  The settlements with Theranos and Holmes are subject to court approval.  Theranos and Holmes neither admitted nor denied the allegations in the SEC’s complaint.  The SEC will litigate its claims against Balwani in federal district court in the Northern District of California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Jessica Chan, Rahul Kolhatkar, and Michael Foley and supervised by Monique Winkler and Erin Schneider in the San Francisco Regional Office.  The SEC’s litigation will be led by Jason Habermeyer and Marc Katz of the San Francisco office.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Suing Equifax in Small Claims Court</title>
<link>https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/people-are-suing-equifax-in-small-claims-court-its-totally-brilliant-heres-why.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/people-are-suing-equifax-in-small-claims-court-its-totally-brilliant-heres-why.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Last September, Christian Haigh learned he was one of the 143 million people in the U.S. whose information was hacked in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/white-house-says-after-equifax-lets-get-rid-of-social-security-numbers.html&quot;&gt;Equifax breach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might recall, Equifax issued an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/17-worst-apologies-of-2017-ranked-in-increasing-order-of-utter-despicableness-and-worst-one-isnt-even-what-you-thought.html&quot;&gt;apology that was almost laughable&lt;/a&gt;. Lawyers started class-action lawsuits. But Haigh, who is a co-founder and CTO of litigation finance startup &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.legalist.com&quot;&gt;Legalist&lt;/a&gt;, had a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He filed suit against the credit reporting giant in small-claims court in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a brilliant idea. I imagine it's unlikely Equifax thought it would be dealing with individual plaintiffs, suing for fairly small dollar amounts, in very informal courtrooms across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I have to &quot;imagine&quot; this, to be clear, because I haven't heard back after emailing the three top U.S. media contacts listed on Equifax's website asking for any comment on this story.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Haigh won an $8,000 judgment against the credit reporting giant--later reduced to $5,500 on appeal. In the process, his company started funding other people's small claims suits against Equifax, too. (Legalist pays lawyers in plaintiff's suits on an hourly basis, and takes a contingency fee if the case is successful.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I interviewed Haigh and his co-founder, CEO Eva Shang, after reading two blog posts in which Haigh described his experience (&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.legalist.com/i-won-8-000-from-equifax-in-small-claims-court-heres-how-you-can-too-f0ce6925c079&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.legalist.com/i-fought-equifaxs-lawyer-in-court-and-won-here-s-how-a16930c53af3&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). The two co-founders, both in their early 20s, were friends at Harvard who left before graduating for Y Combinator, and who raised a $10 million investment round last summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;I think the theme our company really&lt;/span&gt; believes &lt;span&gt;in is that the justice system should be &lt;/span&gt;reoriented &lt;span&gt;to help the underd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;og,&quot; Shang said. &quot;A lot of people... believe it's so &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;stacked in&lt;/span&gt; favor &lt;span&gt;of peopl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;e who&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;have money&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;and power.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I learned more about Haigh's case and the company, I kept seeing certain principles emerge--principles I think can help &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/3-things-people-get-wrong-about-david-vs-goliath.html&quot;&gt;David beat Goliath&lt;/a&gt; in almost any situation. Here's the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fortune favors the bold.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the timeline: The breach happened in July; Equifax disclosed it on September 7. Haigh filed suit on September 19. That's rocket-speed in litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, many lawyers seem to wait until the last day before the statute of limitations expires on a claim before filing. Not Haigh, and none of this would have worked out for him if he hadn't raced to the courthouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Since we heard about [the Equifax breach] and&lt;/span&gt; realized I'd been impacted, I wanted to do something about it,&quot; Haigh told me. &quot;And if I didn't do something then, I would have never done it. I would have waited until the class actions and forgotten. I wanted to do something.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Choose your battlefield.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your data was breached, you may choose not to fight, but that only means that you've conceded easily. If you are going to fight, it's best if you can be the one to choose where the fight takes place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, that meant small-claims court. Doing battle with Equifax there resulted in a &quot;much more relaxed situation,&quot; Haigh said. As we'll see, it worked to his advantage. Contrast that to the many who simply logged into Equifax's website for a year of free credit monitoring--or else, did nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Turn weaknesses into strengths.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is when things start to get graceful; when you can find a way to turn something that should be working against you into an advantage. Haigh isn't a lawyer, and this was his first time in court. But as Shang pointed out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When you're showing up in small claims court, it's not a literal battle between you and the other side. It might feel like it, but you're really trying to impress the judge. It's an arena for regular people to settle grievances. So Christian's weakness--no law degree--became his strength.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Turn strengths into weaknesses.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haigh won, but Equifax appealed the judgment, and it sent a high-powered lawyer from the law firm of King &amp;amp; Spalding to oppose him--along with an in-house lawyer and a company vice president. It would have been natural to be intimidated, but Haigh said he realized this could actually be a good thing for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Equifax, being a large national corporation, part of their litigation strategy is to hire the best people, so they hire King &amp;amp; Spalding. But they're not really thinking through the fact that King &amp;amp; Spalding probably doesn't go to small-claims court very often,&quot; he told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, Haigh writes in his blog post, this benefited him when the company's lead lawyer didn't know (or seemed not to know) that in small claims court, hearsay evidence is admissible. Thus, he wasted time and effort arguing that Haigh shouldn't be allowed to use a report about the Equifax breach from Senator Elizabeth Warren as evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Show up. &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the great philosopher Wayne Gretzky once put it, you miss 100 percent of the shots you don't take. And I guess you lose 100 percent of the small-claims court cases you never get around to filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a no-brainer,&quot; Haigh wrote in his blog post, &quot;but I looked up the woman who came after me as well as the man who preceded me. They both got similar awards, in the $8,000 range. Just showing up to court could mean a significant judgment.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keep showing up.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as I'm punctuating these principles with quotes, how about one supposedly from Winston Churchill: &quot;Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious example of this principle here is the extra effort that Haigh put into winning the appeal--along with his increased &quot;confidence that no matter how stacked the odds are against you, the better case will prevail.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Eat your own dog food.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly don't know if Haigh and Shang filed this suit expecting to fund other people's small-claims cases against Equifax, or if they came up with the idea only afterward. But Shang told me that not long after the data breach story broke, &quot;we actually started getting applications&quot; for funding these kinds of cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's not our main business--our main business is funding business claims, usually,&quot; she said. But she added that with Equifax, &quot;we realized if they pursued their cases in small-claims court, it might be a good opportunity. So we put out an announcement that we would fund Equifax cases, and they really started coming in.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>All disk galaxies rotate once every billion years</title>
<link>http://www.astronomy.com/news/2018/03/all-galaxies-rotate-once-every-billion-years</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.astronomy.com/news/2018/03/all-galaxies-rotate-once-every-billion-years</guid>
<description>In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/476/2/1624/4925565&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published March 9 in &lt;em&gt;The Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society&lt;/em&gt;, astronomers announced the discovery that all disk galaxies rotate about once every billion years, no matter their size or mass.&lt;p&gt;“It’s not Swiss watch precision,” said Gerhardt Meurer, an astronomer from the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR), in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icrar.org/cosmic-clocks/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. “But regardless of whether a galaxy is very big or very small, if you could sit on the extreme edge of its disk as it spins, it would take you about a billion years to go all the way round.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Discovering such regularity in galaxies really helps us to better understand the mechanics that make them tick,” he said. “You won’t find a dense galaxy rotating quickly, while another with the same size but lower density is rotating more slowly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To carry out the study, the researchers measured the radial velocities of neutral hydrogen in the outer disks of a plethora of galaxies — ranging from small dwarf irregulars to massive spirals. These galaxies differed in both size and rotational velocity by up to a factor of 30. With these radial velocity measurements, the researchers were able to calculate the rotational period of their sample galaxies, which led them to conclude that the outer rims of all disk galaxies take roughly a billion years to complete one rotation. However, the researchers note that further research is required to confirm the clock-like spin rate is a universal trait of disk galaxies and not just a result of selection bias.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on theoretical models, the researchers also expected to find only sparse populations of young stars and interstellar gas on the outskirts of these galaxies. But instead, they discovered a significant population of much older stars mingling with the young stars and gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is an important result because knowing where a galaxy ends means we astronomers can limit our observations and not waste time, effort, and computer processing power on studying data from beyond that point,” said Meurer. “So because of this work, we now know that galaxies rotate once every billion years, with a sharp edge that’s populated with a mixture of interstellar gas [and] both old and young stars.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering new generations of radio telescopes — like the long-anticipated &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.astronomy.com/news/2017/11/looking-ahead-to-the-square-kilometer-array&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Square Kilometer Array&lt;/a&gt; (SKA) — will produce massive amounts of data, the fact that researchers now have a good idea where a galaxy’s edge lies should also help them significantly reduce the power required to sort through such data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When the SKA comes online in the next decade,” Meurer said, “we’ll need as much help as we can get to characterize the billions of galaxies these telescopes will soon make available to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UX0o9x3c2P4?ecver=1&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;small&gt;Astronomers discovered that all disk galaxies rotate once every billion years, no matter their size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

<title>Making WebAssembly better for Rust and for all languages</title>
<link>https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/making-webassembly-better-for-rust-for-all-languages/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/making-webassembly-better-for-rust-for-all-languages/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;One big 2018 goal for the Rust community is to become a web language. By targeting WebAssembly, Rust can run on the web just like JavaScript. But what does this mean? Does it mean that Rust is trying to replace JavaScript?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer to that question is no. We don’t expect Rust WebAssembly apps to be written completely in Rust. In fact, we expect the bulk of application code will still be JS, even in most Rust WebAssembly applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because JS is a good choice for most things. It’s quick and easy to get up and running with JavaScript. On top of that, there’s a vibrant ecosystem full of JavaScript developers who have created incredibly innovative approaches to different problems on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/03/01_rust_loves_js.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-32009&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/03/01_rust_loves_js-500x201.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rust logo and JS logo with a heart in between&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;201&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/01_rust_loves_js-500x201.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/01_rust_loves_js-250x101.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/01_rust_loves_js-768x309.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes for specific parts of an application, Rust+WebAssembly is the right tool for the job… like when you’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/01/oxidizing-source-maps-with-rust-and-webassembly/&quot;&gt;parsing source maps&lt;/a&gt;, or figuring out what changes to make to the DOM, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfnkDyHVJzs&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=5880&quot;&gt;Ember&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for Rust+WebAssembly, the path forward doesn’t stop at compiling Rust to WebAssembly. We need to make sure that WebAssembly fits into the JavaScript ecosystem. Web developers need to be able to use WebAssembly as if it were JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But WebAssembly isn’t there yet. To make this happen, we need to build tools to make WebAssembly easier to load, and easier to interact with from JS. This work will help Rust. But it will also help all other languages that target WebAssembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/03/02_pipeline.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-32010&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/03/02_pipeline-500x127.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pipeline from compiling, to generating bindings, to packaging, to bundling&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;127&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/02_pipeline-500x127.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/02_pipeline-250x64.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/02_pipeline-768x195.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What WebAssembly usability challenges are we tackling? Here are a few:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do you make it easy to pass objects between WebAssembly and JS?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you package it all up for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do developers easily combine JS and WASM packages, whether in bundlers or browsers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;But first, what are we making possible in Rust?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust will be able to call JavaScript functions. JavaScript will be able to call Rust functions. Rust will be able to call functions from the host platform, like &lt;code&gt;alert&lt;/code&gt;. Rust crates will be able to have dependencies on npm packages. And throughout all of this, Rust and JavaScript will be passing objects around in a way that makes sense to both of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/03/03_crate_graph.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-32011&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/03/03_crate_graph-500x346.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rust crate graph&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;346&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/03_crate_graph-500x346.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/03_crate_graph-250x173.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/03_crate_graph-768x532.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s what we are making possible in Rust. Now let’s look at the WebAssembly usability challenges that we need to tackle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Q. How do you make it easy to pass objects between WebAssembly and JS?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasm-bindgen&quot;&gt;wasm-bindgen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the hardest parts of working with WebAssembly is getting different kinds of values into and out of functions. That’s because WebAssembly currently only has two types: integers and floating point numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means you can’t just pass a string into a WebAssembly function. Instead, you have to go through a bunch of steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the JS side, encode the string into numbers (using something like the TextEncoder API)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/03/04_wasm_bindgen_01.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-32018&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/03/04_wasm_bindgen_01-500x204.png&quot; alt=&quot;Encoder ring encoding Hello into number equivalent&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;204&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/04_wasm_bindgen_01-500x204.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/04_wasm_bindgen_01-250x102.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/04_wasm_bindgen_01-768x314.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put those numbers into WebAssembly’s memory, which is basically an array of numbers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/03/04_wasm_bindgen_02.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-32019&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/03/04_wasm_bindgen_02-500x295.png&quot; alt=&quot;JS putting numbers into WebAssembly's memory&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;295&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/04_wasm_bindgen_02-500x295.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/04_wasm_bindgen_02-250x148.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/04_wasm_bindgen_02-768x453.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pass the array index for the first letter of the string to the WebAssembly function&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/03/04_wasm_bindgen_03.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-32013&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/03/04_wasm_bindgen_03-500x295.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;295&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/04_wasm_bindgen_03-500x295.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/04_wasm_bindgen_03-250x148.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/04_wasm_bindgen_03-768x453.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the WebAssembly side, use that integer as a pointer to pull out the numbers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/03/04_wasm_bindgen_04.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-32014&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/03/04_wasm_bindgen_04-500x295.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;295&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/04_wasm_bindgen_04-500x295.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/04_wasm_bindgen_04-250x148.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/04_wasm_bindgen_04-768x453.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s only what’s required for strings. If you have more complex types, then you’re going to have a more convoluted process to get the data back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re using a lot of WebAssembly code, you’ll probably abstract this kind of glue code out into a library. Wouldn’t it be nice if you didn’t have to write all that glue code, though? If you could just pass complex values across the language boundary and have them magically work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what &lt;code&gt;wasm-bindgen&lt;/code&gt; does. If you add a few annotations to your Rust code, it will automatically create the code that’s needed (on both sides) to make more complex types work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/03/05_wasm_bindgen_2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-32015&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/03/05_wasm_bindgen_2-500x261.png&quot; alt=&quot;JS passing the string Hello to wasm-bindgen, which does all of the other work&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;261&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/05_wasm_bindgen_2-500x261.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/05_wasm_bindgen_2-250x130.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/05_wasm_bindgen_2-768x400.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means calling JS functions from Rust using whatever types those functions expect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#[wasm_bindgen]
extern {
    type console;

    #[wasm_bindgen(static = console)]
    fn log(s: &amp;amp;str);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn foo() {
    console::log(&quot;hello!&quot;);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… Or using structs in Rust and having them work as classes in JS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
// Rust
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub struct Foo {
    contents: u32,
}

#[wasm_bindgen]
impl Foo {
    pub fn new() -&amp;gt; Foo {
        Foo { contents: 0 }
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    pub fn add(&amp;amp;mut self, amt: u32) -&amp;gt; u32 {
        self.contents += amt;
        return self.contents
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
// JS
import { Foo } from &quot;./js_hello_world&quot;;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
let foo = Foo.new();
assertEq(foo.add(10), 10);
foo.free();
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… Or many other niceties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the hood, &lt;code&gt;wasm-bindgen&lt;/code&gt; is designed to be language-independent. This means that as the tool stabilizes it should be possible to expand support for constructs in other languages, like C/C++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex Crichton will be writing more about &lt;code&gt;wasm-bindgen&lt;/code&gt; in a couple of weeks, so watch for that post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Q. How do you package it all up for npm?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/&quot;&gt;wasm-pack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we put it all together, we have a bunch of files. There’s the compiled WebAssembly file. Then there’s all of the JavaScript — both dependencies and the JS generated by &lt;code&gt;wasm-bindgen&lt;/code&gt;. We need a way to package them all up. Plus, if we’ve added any npm dependencies, we need to put those into the &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; manifest file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/03/06_wasm_pack.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-32016&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/03/06_wasm_pack-500x253.png&quot; alt=&quot;multiple files being packaged up and published to npm&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/06_wasm_pack-500x253.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/06_wasm_pack-250x126.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/06_wasm_pack-768x389.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, it would be nice if this could be done for us. And that’s what &lt;code&gt;wasm-pack&lt;/code&gt; does. It is a one-stop shop for going from a compiled WebAsssembly file to an npm package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will run &lt;code&gt;wasm-bindgen&lt;/code&gt; for you. Then, it will take all of the files and package them up. It will pop a &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; on top, filling in all of the npm dependencies from your Rust code. Then, all &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; need to do is &lt;code&gt;npm publish&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the foundations of this tool are language-independent, so we expect it to support multiple language ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashley Williams will be writing more about &lt;code&gt;wasm-pack&lt;/code&gt; next month, so that’s another post to watch for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Q. How do developers easily combine JS and WASM, whether in bundlers, browsers, or Node?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. ES modules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve published our WebAssembly to npm, how do we make it easy to use that WebAssembly in a JS application?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make it easy to add the WebAssembly package as a dependency… to include it in JS module dependency graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/03/02_js_wasm_graph.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-32020&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/03/02_js_wasm_graph-500x392.png&quot; alt=&quot;module graph with JS and WASM modules&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;392&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/02_js_wasm_graph-500x392.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/02_js_wasm_graph-250x196.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/02_js_wasm_graph-768x602.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, WebAssembly has an imperative JS API for creating modules. You have to write code to do every step, from fetching the file to preparing the dependencies. It’s hard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now that native module support is in browsers, we can add a declarative API. Specifically, we can use the ES module API. With this, working with WebAssembly modules should be as easy as importing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/03/08_import_2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-32023&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/03/08_import_2-500x27.png&quot; alt=&quot;import {myFunction} from &amp;quot;myModule.wasm&amp;quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;27&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/08_import_2-500x27.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/08_import_2-250x14.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/08_import_2-768x42.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re working with TC39 and the WebAssembly community group to standardize this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we don’t just need to standardize ES module support. Even once browsers and Node support ES modules, developers will still likely use bundlers. That’s because bundlers reduce the number of requests that you have to make for module files, which means it takes less time to download your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bundlers do this by combining a bunch of modules from different files into a single file, and then adding a little bit of a runtime to the top to load them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/03/18_bundle_graph_02.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-32021&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/03/18_bundle_graph_02-500x296.png&quot; alt=&quot;a module graph being combined into a single file&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;296&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/18_bundle_graph_02-500x296.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/18_bundle_graph_02-250x148.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/03/18_bundle_graph_02-768x455.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bundlers will still need to use the JS API to create the modules, at least in the short term. But users will be authoring with ES module syntax. Those users will expect their modules to act as if they were ES modules. We’ll need to add some features to WebAssembly to make it easier for bundlers to emulate ES modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be writing more about the effort to add ES module integration to the WebAssembly spec. I’ll also be diving into bundlers and their support for WebAssembly over the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be a useful as a web language, Rust needs to work well with the JavaScript ecosystem. We have some work to do to get there, and fortunately that work will help other languages, too.

<title>Why Is SQLite Coded in C? (2017)</title>
<link>https://sqlite.org/whyc.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://sqlite.org/whyc.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;nosearch&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why Is SQLite Coded In C&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since its inception on 2000-05-29, SQLite has been implemented in generic C. C was and continues to be the best language for implementing a software library like SQLite. There are no plans to recode SQLite in any other programming language anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons why C is the best language to implement SQLite include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compatibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low-dependency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;performance&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.1.&lt;/span&gt; Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An intensively used low-level library like SQLite needs to be fast. (And SQLite is fast, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://sqlite.org/intern-v-extern-blob.html&quot;&gt;Internal Versus External BLOBs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://sqlite.org/fasterthanfs.html&quot;&gt;35% Faster Than The Filesystem&lt;/a&gt; for example.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C is a great language for writing fast code. C is sometimes described as &quot;portable assembly language&quot;. It enables to developers to code as close to the underlying hardware as possible while still remaining portable across platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other programming languages sometimes claim to be &quot;as fast as C&quot;. But no other language claims to be faster than C for general-purpose programming, because none are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;compatibility&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.2.&lt;/span&gt; Compatibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly all systems have the ability to call with libraries written in C. This is not true of other implementation languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for example, Android applications written in Java are able to invoke SQLite (through an adaptor). Maybe it would have been more convenient for Android if SQLite had been coded in Java as that would make the interface simpler. However, on iPhone applications are coded in Objective-C or Swift, neither of which have the ability to call libraries written in Java. Thus, SQLite would be unusable on iPhones had it been written in Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;low_dependency&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.3.&lt;/span&gt; Low-Dependency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libraries written in C do not have a huge run-time dependency. In its minimum configuration, SQLite requires only the following routines from the standard C library:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;memcmp()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;memcpy()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;memmove()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;memset()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;   &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;strcmp()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strlen()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strncmp()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a more complete build, SQLite also uses library routines like malloc() and free() and operating system interfaces for opening, reading, writing, and closing files. But even then, the number of dependencies is very small. Other &quot;modern&quot; language, in contrast, often require multi-megabyte runtimes loaded with thousands and thousands of interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;stability&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.4.&lt;/span&gt; Stability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The C language is old and boring. It is a well-known and well-understood language. This is exactly what one wants when developing a module like SQLite. Writing a small, fast, and reliable database engine is hard enough as it is without the implementation language changing out from under you with each update to the implementation language specification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;copy-block copy-width&quot; readability=&quot;53.223287671233&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon makes no sense. It’s the most befuddling, illogically sprawling, and—to a growing sea of competitors—flat-out terrifying company in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sells soap and produces televised soap operas. It sells complex computing horsepower to the U.S. government and will dispatch a courier to deliver cold medicine on Christmas Eve. It’s the third-most-valuable company on Earth, with smaller annual profits than Southwest Airlines Co., which as of this writing ranks 426th. Chief Executive Officer &lt;a class=&quot;dvz-terminal dvz-t-allow&quot; href=&quot;https://bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/jeffrey-p-bezos/&quot; data-terminal=&quot;RICH&quot;&gt;Jeff Bezos is the world’s richest person&lt;/a&gt;, his fortune built on labor conditions that critics say resemble a Dickens novel with robots, yet he has enough mainstream appeal to play himself in a Super Bowl commercial. Amazon was born in cyberspace, but it occupies warehouses, grocery stores, and other physical real estate equivalent to 90 Empire State Buildings, with a little left over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors have grown to love Amazon.com Inc. despite, or perhaps because of, its contradictions. Shareholders pushed its value above Microsoft Corp.’s for the first time on Valentine’s Day and to an all-time high of $774 billion on March 12. Only Apple Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. remain more valuable, and unlike them, Amazon breaks all the rules of the modern corporation. It’s also wielding its power against an unprecedented range of other businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bezos’ brainchild has been fast-growing, influential, and anomalous for most of its 24 years, but it’s entered a new phase. Its dominance can’t be contained to a few areas such as books, electronics, or even computer networks. Remember my colleague Brad Stone’s book &lt;em&gt;The Everything Store&lt;/em&gt;? That title may have undersold Bezos’ ambitions. He seems to want to establish his place in every industry. Parcel delivery, supermarkets and packaged foods, apparel, trucking, auto parts, pharmaceuticals, real estate brokerages, makeup, concert ticketing, swimming pool supplies, and banking are just a sampling of the fields battered at various points in the past year because of Amazon’s encroachment or even rumors of its interest in entering them. Amazon declined to comment for this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has grown so large and difficult to comprehend that it’s worth taking stock of why and how it’s left corporate America so thoroughly freaked out. Executives at the biggest U.S. companies mentioned Amazon thousands of times during investor calls last year, according to transcripts—more than President Trump and almost as often as taxes. Other companies become verbs because of their products: to Google or to Xerox. Amazon became a verb because of the damage it can inflict on other companies. To be Amazoned means to have your business crushed because the company got into your industry. And fear of being Amazoned has become such a defining feature of commerce, it’s easy to forget the phenomenon has arisen mostly in about three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;container-width copy-width&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;chart-title&quot;&gt;The Amazon effect&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chart-dek&quot;&gt;Healthcare stocks rebased to 2018 Amazon healthcare announcement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chart-dek&quot;&gt;(Jan. 29 market close = 100)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;copy-block copy-width&quot; readability=&quot;26&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2014 everything was going wrong. Amazon introduced the Fire smartphone, one of the bigger flops in the history of consumer electronics. It posted its steepest quarterly loss before taxes and interest—an ignominious milestone for a company with a history of slim or no profits. Revenue growth in the 2014 holiday season was the second­-worst since 2001, and executives started to sound downright pessimistic, as if the business was starting to mature or even stall. They promised the company would be more discerning about spending on projects that might not pay off for years or decades. At one point, Amazon’s top finance executive even tried to blame disappointing sales on students trying to save money by renting textbooks. It was a lame excuse befitting a stodgy company struggling to adapt, not a rising technology superpower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors lost patience. Over the course of 2014, Amazon’s stock price fell more than 20 percent, making the company much less valuable than Walmart Inc. or China’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., an Amazon look-alike that went public that September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year later, however, Amazon had leapfrogged to No. 6 on the list of most valuable companies. Since the end of 2014, its market value has quintupled. This was a case of preparation meeting opportunity. As the company started to clear key thresholds in several of its important businesses, it also revealed that it was sitting on a gold mine made of clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;copy-block copy-width&quot; readability=&quot;59&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 2015, Amazon had what technology analyst Ben Thompson called a second initial public offering. It disclosed for the first time the staggering profitability of Amazon Web Services, which started in 2006 as an experiment to rent out computing horsepower to companies that needed it. It proved to be a big idea that allowed young businesses to get off the ground more quickly and cheaply than before. Large companies, notably Netflix Inc., also started using AWS—first for side projects, then eventually to support essential operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon had always been the clear market leader in this kind of cloud computing service, but few outside the company were prepared for just how valuable AWS had become. Inside Amazon was a division with the muscular profit margins of Starbucks Corp. and higher annual sales than the entire Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurant chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AWS disclosure changed the way investors and stock watchers valued Amazon. Suddenly there was evidence the company could be consistently and nicely profitable if it chose that route. It was also among the biggest signs that Amazon’s head-scratching investments could pay off in a huge way. In 2015, AWS was responsible for two-thirds of total operating profit. Last year it was more than 100 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other long-gestating Amazon businesses also found their groove in 2015. The company tested the loyalty of its 10-year-old Amazon Prime program by holding its first Prime Day, a fake shopping holiday during the summer retail doldrums. The program, which ­delivers fast, free shipping and other benefits to members, gave Amazon not only a predictable stream of membership fees but also a psychological advantage with shoppers. Once they pay their annual dues, they have an incentive to buy as much as possible from Amazon. A year later, on the second Prime Day, total orders rose 60 percent above the first outing. Like Costco Wholesale Corp., Amazon had found a way to compel customers to pay them for the privilege of buying more stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year 2015 was also a milestone for the last of what Bezos calls his “three pillars,” as Amazon topped $100 billion in sales for the first time. About half the merchandise sold on Amazon’s vast online mall comes directly from the company. But the other half is sold by millions of independent shops that open mini-storefronts on the site, a panoply Amazon calls its Marketplace business. It’s the equivalent of Walmart setting up swap meets in its parking lots and mixing stuff from its own shelves alongside the pickings of strangers’ card tables. The independent merchants bear most of the costs of distributing orders, and Amazon collects about 15 percent of the price of their merchandise, plus more fees if they want to be, say, included in Prime. (That’s another 15 percent.) Those rents amounted to $32 billion of revenue last year, or about half of Target Corp.’s yearly sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That holiday season, Amazon recorded its first quarterly operating profit of more than $1 billion, an achievement it’s notched five more times since. Management theorist Jim Collins coined the term “flywheel” to describe a virtuous cycle that makes successful companies ever more successful. For Amazon, it took 20 years for the flywheel to kick in. Bezos now loves to explain how happy customers (who happen to be locked in) give Amazon the ammo to add products and cut prices, which in turn draws more customers, more merchants, and the efficiencies to lower prices further, including by squeezing more money from partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;container-width ai2html-width&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;chart-title&quot;&gt;Amazon is among world's most valuable companies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon lost value after posting its steepest-ever quarterly loss before taxes and interest following the unsuccessful Amazon Fire smartphone launch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;







&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;copy-block copy-width&quot; readability=&quot;117&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;No other company in Amazon’s ballpark is growing as quickly. Its roughly $180 billion in annual sales remains dwarfed by Walmart’s $500 billion, but sales at the big-box retailer inched up 3 percent in the year ended on Jan. 31. Amazon’s revenue rose at least 25 percent in 2017, excluding sales from Whole Foods. That also means Amazon is growing faster than it did three years ago, when it was half its present size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the things Amazon did before 2015 seem hopelessly small compared with its more recent ambitions. In late 2014 it introduced Prime Now, an added Prime tier, in New York City, promising one- or two-hour deliveries of a small variety of consumer staples. Today, Prime Now operates in more than 30 U.S. cities and delivers a much wider range of goods, including electronics and restaurant meals. Three years ago, Amazon owned or leased about 100 million square feet of space around the world, including 109 distribution warehouses and 19 ­U.S. package-sorting facilities. Now the square footage tops 250 million, and it has 150 warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, Amazon has also started leasing its own cargo planes, obtained a license to handle ocean freight, and committed billions of dollars to developing India’s nascent e-commerce market. Its Hollywood studio collected an Academy Award, and its Echo smart speaker basically invented a whole new product category, becoming the envy of Apple and Google. Oh, and last summer, Amazon paid $14 billion to buy a supermarket chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, Amazon’s getting into super­markets would have seemed like evidence that its corporate strategy was scatterbrained and ­profit-averse. After all, the company spent a decade laboring over a grocery delivery service with little success. But the deal for Whole Foods was hailed as a coup. That’s the story of Amazon in its new, terrifying phase: Outsiders look at the same sorts of facts that used to prompt derision, and tremble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many companies, perhaps what’s scariest is that Amazon has lots of room to grow, even in retail. In the U.S., more than 90 percent of all retail sales still happen in physical stores. In some big categories, including home furnishings, ­personal-care products, toys, and food, the brick-and-­mortar numbers are even higher. As the share of online shopping continues to increase, Amazon seems likely to benefit the most. It’s responsible for roughly 44¢ of every dollar Americans spend online, and it’s now mixing in retail stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the 470-odd Whole Foods locations, since 2015 Amazon has opened more than a dozen bookshops and dozens of mall kiosks that sell Kindles and other branded gadgets. There are also 30 Amazon outposts on or near college campuses, offering snacks, phone chargers, other impulse items, and a central point to pick up packages. Some 238 cities entered bids for Amazon’s second North American headquarters. And the company is experimenting with a cashier-less convenience store as well as drive-through locations where people can grab groceries they purchased online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as it was difficult to predict that Amazon would buy upscale supermarkets, it’s tricky to be certain which industries the company might torch next. On Feb. 27, it bought Ring, a maker of home security cameras, and shook the rest of that industry. On March 12, Bloomberg News reported that Amazon plans to team up with a bank to offer a credit card to U.S. small businesses, an area dominated by American Express Co. Shares of AmEx dipped about 1.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more hints in the smoke. Amazon has shown interest in other categories of physical stores, including custom-­made clothing, furniture, and home appliances. Like groceries, those are big retail areas that remain stubbornly offline. Amazon has also spent much of the last several years assembling the pieces of a delivery operation that analysts say might allow it to directly challenge FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc., companies with combined sales of about $126 billion. And health-care companies have been wringing their hands about Amazon’s potential foray into drug distribution or the possibility of its becoming a middleman for health-care benefits. Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., the drugstore retailer, recently began negotiating a full takeover of AmerisourceBergen Corp., one of the largest distributors of prescription drugs. One major motivation is the desire to outpace a possible Amazon entry into the pharmacy business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon is far from invulnerable. All the same old red flags are there—a puny 2.7 percent e-commerce profit in North America, massive outlays to establish delivery routes abroad—but few are paying attention. Anyone buying a share of Amazon stock today is agreeing to pay upfront for the next 180 years of profit. By one measure, it’s generating far less cash than investors believe. And its biggest risk may be the fear of its power in Washington, New York, and Brussels, a possible prelude to regulatory crackdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few tech companies manage to stay this kind of dominant for long, and Amazon can’t sneak up on anyone anymore. It has more outside threats than ever, and there remains a very real risk that it will choke on its own ambition. For now, however, little is being done to contain its or Bezos’ power or aims, and it’s difficult to imagine the company lacking a seat at any table it wants. On March 7, Amazon fixed a bug that left its voice-assistant software, Alexa, cackling aloud, unprompted. Shame—that summed things up nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Practical Introduction to Blockchain with Python</title>
<link>http://adilmoujahid.com/posts/2018/03/intro-blockchain-bitcoin-python/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://adilmoujahid.com/posts/2018/03/intro-blockchain-bitcoin-python/</guid>
<description>&lt;section class=&quot;post&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blockchain is arguably one of the most significant and disruptive technologies that came into existence since the inception of the Internet. It's the core technology behind Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies that drew a lot of attention in the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As its core, a blockchain is a distributed database that allows direct transactions between two parties without the need of a central authority. This simple yet powerful concept has great implications for various institutions such as banks, governments and marketplaces, just to name a few. Any business or organization that relies on a centralized database as a core competitive advantage can potentially be disrupted by blockchain technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting aside all the hype around the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the goal of this blog post is to give you a practical introduction to blockchain technology. Sections 1 and 2 cover some core concepts behind blockchain, while section 3 shows how to implement a blockchain using Python. We will also implement 2 web applications to make it easy for end users to interact with our blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that I'm using Bitcoin here as a medium for explaning the more general technology of &quot;Blockchain&quot;, and most of the concepts described in this post are applicable to other blockchain use cases and crypto-currencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is an animated gif of the two web apps that we will build in section 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adilmoujahid.com/images/blockchain-simulation.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all started with a white paper released in 2008 by an unknown person or entity using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The white paper was titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf&quot;&gt;“Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”&lt;/a&gt; and it laid the foundation of what later became known as Blockchain. In the original Bitcoin white paper, Satoshi described how to build a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that allows online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a centralized institution. This system solves an important problem in digital money called double-spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1.1. What is Double-Spending?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose that Alice wants to pay Bob 1$. If Alice and Bob use physical cash, then Alice will not longer have the 1$ after the transaction is executed. If Alice and Bob use digital money, then the problem gets more complicated. Digital money is in digital form and can be easily duplicated. If Alice sends a digital file worth 1$ to Bob by email for example, Bob cannot know for sure if Alice has deleted her copy of the file. If Alice still has the 1$ digital file, then she can choose to send the same file to Carol. This problem is called double-spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Alt Text&quot; src=&quot;http://adilmoujahid.com/images/blockchain-double-spending.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way of solving the double-spending problem is to have a trusted third party (a bank for example) between Alice, Bob and all other participants in the network. This third party is responsible for managing a centralized ledger that keeps track of and validates all the transactions in the network. The drawback of this solution is that for the system to function, it requires trust in a centralized third party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1.2. Bitcoin: A Decentralized Solution for the Double-Spending Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve the double-spending problem, Satoshi proposed a public ledger, i.e., Bitcoin’s blockchain to keep track of all transactions in the network. Bitcoin’s blockchain has the following characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Distributed: The ledger is replicated across a number of computers, rather than being stored on a central server. Any computer with an internet connection can download a full copy of the blockchain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cryptographic: Cryptography is used to make sure that the sender owns the bitcoin that she's trying to send, and to decide how the transactions are added to the blockchain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immutable: The blockchain can be changed in append only fashion. In other words, transactions can only be added to the blockchain but cannot be deleted or modified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses Proof of Work (PoW): A special type of participants in the network called miners compete on searching for the solution to a cryptographic puzzle that will allow them to add a block of transactions to Bitcoin’s blockchain. This process is called Proof of Work and it allows the system to be secure (more on this later).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Alt Text&quot; src=&quot;http://adilmoujahid.com/images/blockchain-cash-bitcoin.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sending bitcoin money goes as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Step 1 (one-time effort): Create a bitcoin wallet. For a person to send or receive bitcoins, she needs to create a bitcoin wallet. A bitcoin wallet stores 2 pieces of information: A private key and a public key. The private key is a secret number that allows the owner to send bitcoin to another user, or spend bitcoins on services that accept them as payment method. The public key is a number that is needed to receive bitcoins. The public key is also referred to as bitcoin address (not entirely true, but for simplicity we will assume that the public key and the bitcoin address are the same). Note that the wallet doesn’t store the bitcoins themselves. Information about bitcoins balances are stored on the Bitcoin’s blockchain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step 2: Create a bitcoin transaction. If Alice wants to send 1 BTC to Bob, Alice needs to connect to her bitcoin wallet using her private key, and create a transaction that contains the amount of bitcoins she wants to send and the address where she wants to send them (in this case Bob’s public address).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step 3: Broadcast the transaction to Bitcoin’s network. Once Alice creates the bitcoin transaction, she needs to broadcast this transaction to the entire Bitcoin’s network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step 4: Confirm the transaction. A miner listening to Bitcoin’s network authenticates the transaction using Alice's public key, confirms that Alice has enough bitcoins in her wallet (in this case at least 1 BTC), and adds a new record to Bitcoin’s Blockchain containing the details of the transaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step 5: Broadcast the blockchain change to all miners. Once the transaction is confirmed, the miner should broadcast the blockchain change to all miners to make sure that their copies of the blockchain are all in sync.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this section is to go deeper into the technical building blocks that power the blockchain. We will cover public key cryptography, hashing functions, mining and security of the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2.1. Public Key Cryptography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public-key cryptography, or asymmetrical cryptography, is any cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: public keys which may be disseminated widely, and private keys which are known only to the owner. This accomplishes two functions: authentication, where the public key verifies a holder of the paired private key sent the message, and encryption, where only the paired private key holder can decrypt the message encrypted with the public key. [1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)&quot;&gt;RSA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm&quot;&gt;Elliptic Curve Digital Signature (ECDSA)&lt;/a&gt; are the most popular public-key cryptography algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of Bitcoin, ECDSA algorithm is used to generate Bitcoin wallets. Bitcoin uses a variety of keys and addresses, but for the sake of simplicity, we will assume in this blog post that each Bitcoin wallet has one pair of private/public keys and that a Bitcoin address is the wallet's public key. I recommend this &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Technical_background_of_version_1_Bitcoin_addresses&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, if you're interested in the complete technical details of Bitcoin wallets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To send or receive BTCs, a user starts by generating a wallet which contains a pair of private and public keys. If Alice wants to send Bob some BTCs, she creates a transaction in which she enters both her and Bob's public keys, and the amount of BTCs she wants to send. She then sign the transaction using her private key. A computer on the blockchain uses Alice's public key to verify that the transaction is authentic and adds the transaction to a block that will be later added to the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Alt Text&quot; src=&quot;http://adilmoujahid.com/images/blockchain-public-crypto.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2.2. Hashing Functions and Mining&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Bitcoin transactions are grouped in files called blocks. Bitcoin adds a new block of transactions every 10 minutes. Once a new block is added to the blockchain, it becomes immutable and can't be deleted or modified. A special group of participants in the network called miners (computers connected to the blockchain) are responsible for creating new blocks of transactions. A miner has to authenticate each transaction using the sender's public key, confirm that the sender has enough balance for the requested transaction, and add the transaction to the block. Miners are completely free to choose which transactions to include in the blocks, therefore the senders need to include a transaction fee to incentivise the miners to add their transactions to the blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a block to be accepted by the blockchain, it needs to be &quot;mined&quot;. To mine a block, miners need to find an extremely rare solution to a cryptographic puzzle. If a mined block is accepted by the blockchain, the miner receive a reward in bitcoins which is an additional incentive to transaction fees. The mining process is also referred to as Proof of Work (PoW), and it's the main mechanism that enables the blockchain to be trustless and secure (more on blockchain security later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hashing and Blockchain's Cryptographic Puzzle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the blockchain's cryptographic puzzle, we need to start with hash functions. A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to data of fixed size. The values returned by a hash function are called hashes. Hash functions are usually used to accelerate database lookup by detecting duplicated records, and they are also widely used in cryptography. A cryptographic hash function allows one to easily verify that some input data maps to a given hash value, but if the input data is unknown, it is deliberately difficult to reconstruct it by knowing the stored hash value. [2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoins uses a cryptographic hash function called SHA-256. SHA-256 is applied to a combination of the block's data (bitcoin transactions) and a number called nonce. By changing the block data or the nonce, we get completely different hashes. For a block to be considered valid or &quot;mined&quot;, the hash value of the block and the nonce needs to meet a certain condition. For example, the four leading digits of the hash needs to be equal to &quot;0000&quot;. We can increase the mining complexity by making the condition more complex, for example we can increase the number of 0s that the hash value needs to start with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cryptograhic puzzle that miners need to solve is to find a nonce value that makes the hash value satisfies the mining condition. You can use the app below to simulate block mining. When you type in the &quot;Data&quot; text box or change the nonce value, you can notice the change in the hash value. When you click the &quot;Mine&quot; button, the app starts with a nonce equals to zero, computes the hash value and checks if the leading four digits of the hash value is equal to &quot;0000&quot;. If the leading four digits are not equal to &quot;0000&quot;, it increments the nonce by one and repeats the whole process until it finds a nonce value that satisify the condition. If the block is considered mined, the background color turns green.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2.3. From Blocks to Blockchain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As discussed in the previous section, transactions are grouped in blocks and blocks are appended to the blockchain. In order to create a chain of blocks, each new block uses the previous block’s hash as part of its data. To create a new block, a miner selects a set of transactions, adds the previous block’s hash and mines the block in a similar fashion described above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any changes to the data in any block will affect all the hash values of the blocks that come after it and they will become invalid. This give the blockchain its immutability characteristic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Alt Text&quot; src=&quot;http://adilmoujahid.com/images/blockchain-from-blocks.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use the app below to simulate a blockchain with 3 blocks. When you type in the &quot;Data&quot; text box or change the nonce value, you can notice the change in the hash value and the &quot;Prev&quot; value (previous hash) of the next block. You can simulate the mining process by clicking on the “Mine” button of each individual block. After mining the 3 blocks, try changing the data in block 1 or 2, and you will notice that all the blocks that come after become invalid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both mining simulators above were adapted from Anders Brownworth's excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://anders.com/blockchain/blockchain.html&quot;&gt;Blockchain Demo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2.4. Adding Blocks to the Blockchain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the miners in the Bitcoin network compete with each other to find a valid block that will be added to the blockchain and get the reward from the network. Finding a nonce that validated a block is rare, but because of the number of miners, the probability of a miner in the network validating a block is extremely high. The first miner to submit a valid block gets his block added to the blockchain and receives the reward in bitcoins. But what happens if two miners or more submit their blocks at the same time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Resolving Conflicts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If 2 miners solve a block at almost the same time, then we will have 2 different blockchains in the network, and we need to wait for the next block to resolve the conflict. Some miners will decide to mine on top of blockchain 1 and others on top of blockchain 2. The first miner to find a new block resolves the conflict. If the new block was mined on top of blockchain 1, then blockchain 2 becomes invalid, the reward of the previous block goes to the miner from blockchain 1 and the transactions that were part of blockchain 2 and weren’t added to the blockchain go back to the transactions pool and get added to the next blocks. In short, if there is a conflict on the blockchain, then the the longest chain wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Alt Text&quot; src=&quot;http://adilmoujahid.com/images/blockchain-the-longest-chain-wins.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2.5. Blockchain and Double-Spending&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, we will cover the most popular ways for performing double-spending attacks on the blockchain, and the measures that users should take to prevent damages from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Race Attack&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attacker sends the same coin in rapid succession to two different addresses. To prevent from this attack, it is recommended to wait for at least one block confirmation before accepting the payment. [3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Finney Attack&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attacker pre-mines a block with a transaction, and spends the same coins in a second transaction before releasing the block. In this scenario, the second transaction will not be validated. To prevent from this attack, it is recommended to wait for at least 6 block confirmations before accepting the payment. [3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Majority Attack (also called 51% attack)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this attack, the attacker owns 51% of the computing power of the network. The attacker starts by making a transaction that is brodcasted to the entire network, and then mines a private blockchain where he double-spends the coins of the previous transaction. Since the attacker owns the majority of the computing power, he is guaranteed that he will have at some point a longer chain than the &quot;honest&quot; network. He can then release his longer blockchain that will replace the &quot;honest&quot; blockchain and cancel the original transaction. This attack is highly unlikely, as it’s very expensive in blockchain networks like Bitcoin. [4]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section, we will implement a basic blockchain and a blockchain client using Python. Our blockchain will have the following features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Possibility of adding multiple nodes to the blockchain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proof of Work (PoW)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple conflict resolution between nodes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transactions with RSA encryption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our blockchain client will have the following features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wallets generation using Public/Private key encryption (based on RSA algorithm)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generation of transactions with RSA encryption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will also implement 2 dashboards:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Blockchain Frontend&quot; for miners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Blockchain Client&quot; for users to generate wallets and send coins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blockchain implementation is mostly based on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dvf/blockchain&quot;&gt;github project&lt;/a&gt;. I made a few modifications to the original code in order to add RSA encryption to the transactions. Wallet generation and transaction encryption is based on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/julienr/ipynb_playground/blob/master/bitcoin/dumbcoin/dumbcoin.ipynb&quot;&gt;Jupyter notebook&lt;/a&gt;. The 2 dashboard are implemented from scratch using HTML/CSS/JS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download the complete source code from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/adilmoujahid/blockchain-python-tutorial&quot;&gt;https://github.com/adilmoujahid/blockchain-python-tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that this implementation is for educational purposes only and shouldn't be use in production as it doesn't have good security, doesn't scale well and lacks many important features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3.1. Blockchain Client Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can start the blockchain client from the terminal by going to the &lt;code&gt;blockchain_client&lt;/code&gt; folder, and typing &lt;code&gt;python blockchain_client.py&lt;/code&gt;. In your browser, go to &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:8080&lt;/code&gt; and you'll see the dashboard below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adilmoujahid.com/images/blockchain-client.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dashboard has 3 tabs in the navigation bar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wallet Generator: To generate wallets (Public/Private keys pair) using RSA encryption algorithm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make Transaction: To generate transactions and send them to a blockchain node&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View Transasctions: To view the transactions that are on the blockchain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to make or view transactions, you will need at least one blockchain node running (to be covered in next section).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is some explanation of the most important parts in the &lt;code&gt;blockchain_client.py&lt;/code&gt; code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We define a python class that we name &lt;code&gt;Transaction&lt;/code&gt; that has 4 attributes &lt;code&gt;sender_address&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sender_private_key&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;recipient_address&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt;. These are the 4 pieces of information that a sender needs to create a transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;to_dict()&lt;/code&gt; method returns the transaction information in a Python dictionary format (without the sender's private key). The &lt;code&gt;sign_transaction()&lt;/code&gt; method takes the transaction information (without the sender's private key) and signs it using the sender's private key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Transaction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sender_address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sender_private_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;recipient_address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sender_address&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sender_address&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sender_private_key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sender_private_key&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;recipient_address&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;recipient_address&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;__getattr__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;attr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;attr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;to_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;OrderedDict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'sender_address'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sender_address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'recipient_address'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;recipient_address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'value'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sign_transaction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;sd&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;sd&quot;&gt;        Sign transaction with private key&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;sd&quot;&gt;        &quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;private_key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;RSA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;importKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;binascii&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;unhexlify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sender_private_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;signer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PKCS1_v1_5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;private_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line below initate a &lt;code&gt;Python Flask&lt;/code&gt; app that we will use to create different APIs to interact with the blockchain and its client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below we define the 3 &lt;code&gt;Flask&lt;/code&gt; routes that returns html pages. One html page for each tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3.2. Blockchain Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can start a blockchain node from the terminal by going to the &lt;code&gt;blockchain&lt;/code&gt; folder, and type &lt;code&gt;python blockchain_client.py&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;python blockchain_client.py -p &amp;lt;PORT NUMBER&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. If you don't specify a port number, it will default to port 5000. In your browser, go to &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:&amp;lt;PORT NUMBER&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to see the blockchain frontend dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adilmoujahid.com/images/blockchain-frontend.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dashboard has 2 tabs in the navigation bar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mine: For viewing transactions and blockchain data, and for mining new blocks of transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure: For configuring connections between the different blockchain nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is some explanation of the most important parts in the &lt;code&gt;blockchain.py&lt;/code&gt; code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start by defining a &lt;code&gt;Blockchain&lt;/code&gt; class that has the following attributes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;transactions&lt;/code&gt;: List of transactions that will be added to the next block.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;chain&lt;/code&gt;: The actual blockchain which is an array of blocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;nodes&lt;/code&gt;: A set containing node urls. The blockchain uses these nodes to retrieve blockchain data from other nodes and updates its blockchain if they're not in sync.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;node_id&lt;/code&gt;: A random string to identify the blockchain node.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Blockchain&lt;/code&gt; class also implements the following methods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;register_node(node_url)&lt;/code&gt;: Adds a new blockchain node to the list of nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;verify_transaction_signature(sender_address, signature, transaction)&lt;/code&gt;: Checks that the provided signature corresponds to transaction signed by the public key (sender_address).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;submit_transaction(sender_address, recipient_address, value, signature)&lt;/code&gt;: Adds a transaction to list of transactions if the signature verified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;create_block(nonce, previous_hash)&lt;/code&gt;: Adds a block of transactions to the blockchain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;hash(block)&lt;/code&gt;: Create a SHA-256 hash of a block.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;proof_of_work()&lt;/code&gt;: Proof of work algorithm. Looks for a nonce that satisfies the mining condition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;valid_proof(transactions, last_hash, nonce, difficulty=MINING_DIFFICULTY)&lt;/code&gt;: Checks if a hash value satisfies the mining conditions. This function is used within the proof_of_work function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;valid_chain(chain)&lt;/code&gt;: checks if a bockchain is valid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;resolve_conflicts()&lt;/code&gt;: Resolves conflicts between blockchain's nodes by replacing a chain with the longest one in the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;28&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Blockchain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The line below initate a &lt;code&gt;Python Flask&lt;/code&gt; app that we will use to create different APIs to interact with the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we initiate a Blockchain instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;blockchain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Blockchain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below we define the 2 &lt;code&gt;Flask&lt;/code&gt; routes that return the html pages for our blockchain frontend dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below we define &lt;code&gt;Flask&lt;/code&gt; APIs to manage transactions and mining the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;'/transactions/new'&lt;/code&gt;: This API takes as input &lt;code&gt;'sender_address'&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;'recipient_address'&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;'amount'&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;'signature'&lt;/code&gt;, and adds the transaction to the list of transactions that will be added to next block if the signature is valid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;'/transactions/get'&lt;/code&gt;: This API returns all the transactions that will be added to the next block.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;'/chain'&lt;/code&gt;: This API returns all blockchain data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;'/mine'&lt;/code&gt;: This API runs the proof of work algorithm, and adds the new block of transactions to the blockchain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@app.route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'/transactions/new'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'POST'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below we define Flask APIs to manage blockchain nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;'/nodes/register'&lt;/code&gt;: This API takes as input a list of node urls, and adds them to the list of nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;'/nodes/resolve'&lt;/code&gt;: This API resolves conflicts between blockchain nodes by replacing a local chain with the longest one available in the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;'/nodes/get'&lt;/code&gt;: This API returns the list of nodes.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we covered some core concepts behind blockchain and we learned how to implement one using Python. For the sake of simplicity, I didn't cover some technical details, for example: Wallet addresses and Merkel trees. If you want to learn more about the subject, I recommend reading the original Bitcoin white paper and follow up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page&quot;&gt;bitcoin wiki&lt;/a&gt; and Andreas Antonopoulos's excellent book: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491954388/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1491954388&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=adilmoujahid-20&amp;amp;linkId=bd776f9224715e8a022d4984909d6a69&quot;&gt;Mastering Bitcoin: Programming the Open Blockchain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>&amp;#039;Mind Over Matter&amp;#039;: Stephen Hawking – Obituary by Roger Penrose</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/14/stephen-hawking-obituary</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/14/stephen-hawking-obituary</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The image of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/hawking&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Stephen Hawking&lt;/a&gt; – who has died aged 76 – in his motorised wheelchair, with head contorted slightly to one side and hands crossed over to work the controls, caught the public imagination, as a true symbol of the triumph of mind over matter. As with the Delphic oracle of ancient Greece, physical impairment seemed compensated by almost supernatural gifts, which allowed his mind to roam the universe freely, upon occasion enigmatically revealing some of its secrets hidden from ordinary mortal view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, such a romanticised image can represent but a partial truth. Those who knew Hawking would clearly appreciate the dominating presence of a real human being, with an enormous zest for life, great humour, and tremendous determination, yet with normal human weaknesses, as well as his more obvious strengths. It seems clear that he took great delight in his commonly perceived role as “the No 1 celebrity scientist”; huge audiences would attend his public lectures, perhaps not always just for scientific edification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific community might well form a more sober assessment. He was extremely highly regarded, in view of his many greatly impressive, sometimes revolutionary, contributions to the understanding of the physics and the geometry of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawking had been diagnosed shortly after his 21st birthday as suffering from an unspecified incurable disease, which was then identified as the fatal degenerative motor neurone disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. Soon afterwards, rather than succumbing to depression, as others might have done, he began to set his sights on some of the most fundamental questions concerning the physical nature of the universe. In due course, he would achieve extraordinary successes against the severest physical disabilities. Defying established medical opinion, he managed to live another 55 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His background was academic, though not directly in mathematics or physics. His father, Frank, was an expert in tropical diseases and his mother, Isobel (nee Walker), was a free-thinking radical who had a great influence on him. He was born in Oxford and moved to St Albans, Hertfordshire, at eight. Educated at St Albans school, he won a scholarship to study physics at University College, Oxford. He was recognised as unusually capable by his tutors, but did not take his work altogether seriously. Although he obtained a first-class degree in 1962, it was not a particularly outstanding one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He decided to continue his career in physics at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, proposing to study under the distinguished cosmologist &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/aug/23/guardianobituaries.spaceexploration&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Fred Hoyle&lt;/a&gt;. He was disappointed to find that Hoyle was unable to take him, the person available in that area being Dennis Sciama, unknown to Hawking at the time. In fact, this proved fortuitous, for Sciama was becoming an outstandingly stimulating figure in British cosmology, and would supervise several students who were to make impressive names for themselves in later years (including the future astronomer royal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/dec/02/highereducationprofile.research&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Lord Rees of Ludlow&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sciama seemed to know everything that was going on in physics at the time, especially in cosmology, and he conveyed an infectious excitement to all who encountered him. He was also very effective in bringing together people who might have things of significance to communicate with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Hawking was in his second year of research at Cambridge, I (at Birkbeck College in London) had established a certain mathematical theorem of relevance. This showed, on the basis of a few plausible assumptions (by the use of global/topological techniques largely unfamiliar to physicists at the time) that a collapsing over-massive star would result in a singularity in space-time – a place where it would be expected that densities and space-time curvatures would become infinite – giving us the picture of what we now refer to as a “black hole”. Such a space-time singularity would lie deep within a “horizon”, through which no signal or material body can escape. (This picture had been put forward by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/16/inside-centre-robert-oppenheimer-ray-monk-review&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;J Robert Oppenheimer&lt;/a&gt; and Hartland Snyder in 1939, but only in the special circumstance where exact spherical symmetry was assumed. The purpose of this new theorem was to obviate such unrealistic symmetry assumptions.) At this central singularity, Einstein’s classical theory of general relativity would have reached its limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Hawking had also been thinking about this kind of problem with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/may/13/research.highereducation&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;George Ellis&lt;/a&gt;, who was working on a PhD at St John’s College, Cambridge. The two men had been working on a more limited type of “singularity theorem” that required an unreasonably restrictive assumption. Sciama made a point of bringing Hawking and me together, and it did not take Hawking long to find a way to use my theorem in an unexpected way, so that it could be applied (in a time-reversed form) in a cosmological setting, to show that the space-time singularity referred to as the “big bang” was also a feature not just of the standard highly symmetrical cosmological models, but also of any qualitatively similar but asymmetrical model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the assumptions in my original theorem seem less natural in the cosmological setting than they do for collapse to a black hole. In order to generalise the mathematical result so as to remove such assumptions, Hawking embarked on a study of new mathematical techniques that appeared relevant to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A powerful body of mathematical work known as Morse theory had been part of the machinery of mathematicians active in the global (topological) study of Riemannian spaces. However, the spaces that are used in Einstein’s theory are really pseudo-Riemannian and the relevant Morse theory differs in subtle but important ways. Hawking developed the necessary theory for himself (aided, in certain respects, by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/nov/26/usnews.sciencenews&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Charles Misner&lt;/a&gt;, Robert Geroch and Brandon Carter) and was able to use it to produce new theorems of a more powerful nature, in which the assumptions of my theorem could be considerably weakened, showing that a big-bang-type singularity was a necessary implication of Einstein’s general relativity in broad circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years later (in a paper published by the Royal Society in 1970, by which time Hawking had become a fellow “for distinction in science” of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge), he and I joined forces to publish an even more powerful theorem which subsumed almost all the work in this area that had gone before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1967, Werner Israel published a remarkable paper that had the implication that non-rotating black holes, when they had finally settled down to become stationary, would necessarily become completely spherically symmetrical. Subsequent results by Carter, David Robinson and others generalised this to include rotating black holes, the implication being that the final space-time geometry must necessarily accord with an explicit family of solutions of Einstein’s equations found by Roy Kerr in 1963. A key ingredient to the full argument was that if there is any rotation present, then there must be complete axial symmetry. This ingredient was basically supplied by Hawking in 1972.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very remarkable conclusion of all this is that the black holes that we expect to find in nature have to conform to this Kerr geometry. As the great theoretical astrophysicist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/22/obituaries/subrahmanyan-chandrasekhar-84-is-dead-noble-laureate-uncovered-white-dwarfs.html?pagewanted=all&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Subramanyan Chandrasekhar&lt;/a&gt; subsequently commented, black holes are the most perfect macroscopic objects in the universe, being constructed just out of space and time; moreover, they are the simplest as well, since they can be exactly described by an explicitly known geometry (that of Kerr).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-2 | 1&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following his work in this area, Hawking established a number of important results about black holes, such as an argument for its event horizon (its bounding surface) having to have the topology of a sphere. In collaboration with Carter and James Bardeen, in work published in 1973, he established some remarkable analogies between the behaviour of black holes and the basic laws of thermodynamics, where the horizon’s surface area and its surface gravity were shown to be analogous, respectively, to the thermodynamic quantities of entropy and temperature. It would be fair to say that in his highly active period leading up to this work, Hawking’s research in classical general relativity was the best anywhere in the world at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawking, Bardeen and Carter took their “thermodynamic” behaviour of black holes to be little more than just an analogy, with no literal physical content. A year or so earlier, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/22/science/space/jacob-bekenstein-physicist-who-revolutionized-theory-of-black-holes-dies-at-68.html?_r=0&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Jacob Bekenstein&lt;/a&gt; had shown that the demands of physical consistency imply – in the context of quantum mechanics – that a black hole must indeed have an actual physical entropy (“entropy” being a physicist’s measure of “disorder”) that is proportional to its horizon’s surface area, but he was unable to establish the proportionality factor precisely. Yet it had seemed, on the other hand, that the physical temperature of a black hole must be exactly zero, inconsistently with this analogy, since no form of energy could escape from it, which is why Hawking and his colleagues were not prepared to take their analogy completely seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawking had then turned his attention to quantum effects in relation to black holes, and he embarked on a calculation to determine whether tiny rotating black holes that might perhaps be created in the big bang would radiate away their rotational energy. He was startled to find that irrespective of any rotation they would radiate away their energy – which, by Einstein’s E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, means their mass. Accordingly, any black hole actually has a non-zero temperature, agreeing precisely with the Bardeen-Carter-Hawking analogy. Moreover, Hawking was able to supply the precise value “one quarter” for the entropy proportionality constant that Bekenstein had been unable to determine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This radiation coming from black holes that Hawking predicted is now, very appropriately, referred to as Hawking radiation. For any black hole that is expected to arise in normal astrophysical processes, however, the Hawking radiation would be exceedingly tiny, and certainly unobservable directly by any techniques known today. But he argued that very tiny black holes could have been produced in the big bang itself, and the Hawking radiation from such holes would build up into a final explosion that might be observed. There appears to be no evidence for such explosions, showing that the big bang was not so accommodating as Hawking wished, and this was a great disappointment to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These achievements were certainly important on the theoretical side. They established the theory of black-hole thermodynamics: by combining the procedures of quantum (field) theory with those of general relativity, Hawking established that it is necessary also to bring in a third subject, thermodynamics. They are generally regarded as Hawking’s greatest contributions. That they have deep implications for future theories of fundamental physics is undeniable, but the detailed nature of these implications is still a matter of much heated debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawking himself was able to conclude from all this (though not with universal acceptance by particle physicists) that those fundamental constituents of ordinary matter – the protons – must ultimately disintegrate, although with a decay rate that is beyond present-day techniques for observing it. He also provided reasons for suspecting that the very rules of quantum mechanics might need modification, a viewpoint that he seemed originally to favour. But later (unfortunately, in my own opinion) he came to a different view, and at the Dublin international conference on gravity in July 2004, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/jul/30/peopleinscience.universe&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;he publicly announced a change of mind&lt;/a&gt; (thereby conceding a bet with the Caltech physicist John Preskill) concerning his originally predicted “information loss” inside black holes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following his black-hole work, Hawking turned his attentions to the problem of quantum gravity, developing ingenious ideas for resolving some of the basic issues. Quantum gravity, which involves correctly imposing the quantum procedures of particle physics on to the very structure of space-time, is generally regarded as the most fundamental unsolved foundational issue in physics. One of its stated aims is to find a physical theory that is powerful enough to deal with the space-time singularities of classical general relativity in black holes and the big bang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawking’s work, up to this point, although it had involved the procedures of quantum mechanics in the curved space-time setting of Einstein’s general theory of relativity, did not provide a quantum gravity theory. That would require the “quantisation” procedures to be applied to Einstein’s curved space-time itself, not just to physical fields within curved space-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With James Hartle, Hawking developed a quantum procedure for handling the big-bang singularity. This is referred to as the “no-boundary” idea, whereby the singularity is replaced by a smooth “cap”, this being likened to what happens at the north pole of the Earth, where the concept of longitude loses meaning (becomes singular) while the north pole itself has a perfectly good geometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sense of this idea, Hawking needed to invoke his notion of “imaginary time” (or “Euclideanisation”), which has the effect of converting the “pseudo-Riemannian” geometry of Einstein’s space-time into a more standard Riemannian one. Despite the ingenuity of many of these ideas, grave difficulties remain (one of these being how similar procedures could be applied to the singularities inside black holes, which is fundamentally problematic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many other approaches to quantum gravity being pursued worldwide, and Hawking’s procedures, though greatly respected and still investigated, are not the most popularly followed, although all others have their share of fundamental difficulties also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the end of his life, Hawking continued with his research into the quantum-gravity problem, and the related issues of cosmology. But concurrently with his strictly research interests, he became increasingly involved with the popularisation of science, and of his own ideas in particular. This began with the writing of his astoundingly successful book A Brief History of Time (1988), which was translated into some 40 languages and sold over 25m copies worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, the brilliant title was a contributing factor to the book’s phenomenal success. Also, the subject matter is something that grips the public imagination. And there is a directness and clarity of style, which Hawking must have developed as a matter of necessity when trying to cope with the limitations imposed by his physical disabilities. Before needing to rely on his computerised speech, he could talk only with great difficulty and expenditure of effort, so he had to do what he could with short sentences that were directly to the point. In addition, it is hard to deny that his physical condition must itself have caught the public’s imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the dissemination of science among a broader public was certainly one of Hawking’s aims in writing his book, he also had the serious purpose of making money. His financial needs were considerable, as his entourage of family, nurses, healthcare helpers and increasingly expensive equipment demanded. Some, but not all, of this was covered by grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To invite Hawking to a conference always involved the organisers in serious calculations. The travel and accommodation expenses would be enormous, not least because of the sheer number of people who would need to accompany him. But a popular lecture by him would always be a sell-out, and special arrangements would be needed to find a lecture hall that was big enough. An additional factor would be the ensuring that all entrances, stairways, lifts, and so on would be adequate for disabled people in general, and for his wheelchair in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He clearly enjoyed his fame, taking many opportunities to travel and to have unusual experiences (such as going down a mine shaft, visiting the south pole and undergoing the zero-gravity of free fall), and to meet other distinguished people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentational polish of his public lectures increased with the years. Originally, the visual material would be line drawings on transparencies, presented by a student. But in later years impressive computer-generated visuals were used. He controlled the verbal material, sentence by sentence, as it would be delivered by his computer-generated American-accented voice. High-quality pictures and computer-generated graphics also featured in his later popular books The Illustrated Brief History of Time (1996) and The Universe in a Nutshell (2001). With his daughter Lucy he wrote the expository children’s science book George’s Secret Key to the Universe (2007), and he served as an editor, co-author and commentator for many other works of popular science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He received many high accolades and honours. In particular, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society at the remarkably early age of 32 and received its highest honour, the Copley medal, in 2006. In 1979, he became the 17th holder of the Lucasian chair of natural philosophy in Cambridge, some 310 years after Sir Isaac Newton became its second holder. He became a Companion of Honour in 1989. He made a guest appearance on the television programme Star Trek: The Next Generation, appeared in cartoon form on The Simpsons and was portrayed in the movie The Theory of Everything (2014).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clear that he owed a great deal to his first wife, Jane Wilde, whom he married in 1965, and with whom he had three children, Robert, Lucy and Timothy. Jane was exceptionally supportive of him in many ways. One of the most important of these may well have been in allowing him to do things for himself to an unusual extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was an extraordinarily determined person. He would insist that he should do things for himself. This, in turn, perhaps kept his muscles active in a way that delayed their atrophy, thereby slowing the progress of the disease. Nevertheless, his condition continued to deteriorate, until he had almost no movement left, and his speech could barely be made out at all except by a very few who knew him well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He contracted pneumonia while in Switzerland in 1985, and a tracheotomy was necessary to save his life. Strangely, after this brush with death, the progress of his degenerative disease seemed to slow to a virtual halt. His tracheotomy prevented any form of speech, however, so that acquiring a computerised speech synthesiser came as a necessity at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of his encounter with pneumonia, the Hawkings’ home was almost taken over by nurses and medical attendants, and he and Jane drifted apart. They were divorced in 1995. In the same year, Hawking married Elaine Mason, who had been one of his nurses. Her support took a different form from Jane’s. In his far weaker physical state, the love, care and attention that she provided sustained him in all his activities. Yet this relationship also came to an end, and he and Elaine were divorced in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-2 | 2&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite his terrible physical circumstance, he almost always remained positive about life. He enjoyed his work, the company of other scientists, the arts, the fruits of his fame, his travels. He took great pleasure in children, sometimes entertaining them by swivelling around in his motorised wheelchair. Social issues concerned him. He promoted scientific understanding. He could be generous and was very often witty. On occasion he could display something of the arrogance that is not uncommon among physicists working at the cutting edge, and he had an autocratic streak. Yet he could also show a true humility that is the mark of greatness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawking had many students, some of whom later made significant names for themselves. Yet being a student of his was not easy. He had been known to run his wheelchair over the foot of a student who caused him irritation. His pronouncements carried great authority, but his physical difficulties often caused them to be enigmatic in their brevity. An able colleague might be able to disentangle the intent behind them, but it would be a different matter for an inexperienced student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To such a student, a meeting with Hawking could be a daunting experience. Hawking might ask the student to pursue some obscure route, the reason for which could seem deeply mysterious. Clarification was not available, and the student would be presented with what seemed indeed to be like the revelation of an oracle – something whose truth was not to be questioned, but which if correctly interpreted and developed would surely lead onwards to a profound truth. Perhaps we are all left with this impression now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawking is survived by his children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bullet&quot;&gt;•&lt;/span&gt; Stephen William Hawking, physicist, born 8 January 1942; died 14 March 2018, aged 76.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How knowing Lisp destroyed my programming career (2006)</title>

&lt;p&gt;Ron Garret wrote:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. I do not hate Lisp. It is and has always been my favorite&lt;br /&gt;programming languages. My love for Lisp pretty much destroyed my career&lt;br /&gt;as a programmer. My motivation for criticising Lisp is not to convince&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;How did it do this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;That's a long story. Part of it is told here:&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html&quot;&gt;http://www.flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.lisp/msg/6f75cfb5a289d3f6&quot;&gt;http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.lisp/msg/6f75cfb5a289d3f6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the context of the current discussion I think it's worthwhile&lt;br /&gt;giving an abridged version:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first learned Lisp in the early 80's when I was still in high school.&lt;br /&gt;I was interested in AI, and in those days Lisp was the lingua franca. I&lt;br /&gt;took a little detour as an undergrad by getting a EE degree, but in grad&lt;br /&gt;school in the mid-80's I went back to Lisp (mostly Scheme and Franz Lisp&lt;br /&gt;back then, and later MacScheme and Coral Lisp, which would later morph&lt;br /&gt;into MCL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My colleagues were using C (K&amp;amp;R in those days) or Pascal. C++, Perl,&lt;br /&gt;Java, Python, etc. didn't exist. When all those modern languages are&lt;br /&gt;out of the picture, Lisp rocks. I mean it just blows everything else&lt;br /&gt;clean out of the water. With a secret weapon like Lisp in my arsenal in&lt;br /&gt;1986 I could blow my competition out of the water with one hand tied&lt;br /&gt;behind my back and holding a martini in the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(I remember my compilers class in particular. What took my colleagues&lt;br /&gt;reams and reams and reams of Pascal code took me a page of Lisp. This&lt;br /&gt;was before networks became ubiquitous. We turned in assignments on&lt;br /&gt;paper in those days. I still have my folder with all my homework&lt;br /&gt;assignments from that class. It's about a quarter of an inch thick.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of competitive advantage continued throughout my graduate&lt;br /&gt;career. The competition switched from Pascal to C, but it was still no&lt;br /&gt;contest. Then they switched to C++ in the early 90's -- or at least&lt;br /&gt;they tried. The state of C++ was so horrific back then that they were&lt;br /&gt;forced to go back to Lisp because they just couldn't get things to run&lt;br /&gt;in C++ even though they tried very very hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a funny thing happened in the late 90's. C++ got its act together.&lt;br /&gt;Java and Perl came along (and later, Python). Meanwhile, Lisp hadn't&lt;br /&gt;advanced much in about a decade (since the ANSI spec was finalized). It&lt;br /&gt;was still a win, but the competition had narrowed the field. Once upon&lt;br /&gt;a time Lisp had a long list of features that no other language had (GC,&lt;br /&gt;full numeric tower, CLOS, incremental development, macros) that list&lt;br /&gt;kept getting shorter and shorter, and the case for Lisp, which had never&lt;br /&gt;been easy even in the best of times, was getting harder and harder to&lt;br /&gt;make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I went to Google in 2000 with this really impressive resume that I&lt;br /&gt;had built using Lisp, and when I got there they said, &quot;Glad you're here,&lt;br /&gt;we want you to write Java code.&quot; Thing is, I had never really had to&lt;br /&gt;learn Java, so I wasn't very good at it. On top of that, knowing Lisp&lt;br /&gt;made me all too keenly aware of Java's shortcomings, and I had a very&lt;br /&gt;hard time not being angry at how stupid it was that I was being forced&lt;br /&gt;to use it. (If you want more details about that part of my life story,&lt;br /&gt;read xooglers.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then a very strange thing happened: I noticed that all around me&lt;br /&gt;people were writing code using C++ and Java and Python and even (gasp!)&lt;br /&gt;Perl, and they were actually getting it to work without tearing their&lt;br /&gt;hair out. In fact, in a number of cases I saw people whip things up in&lt;br /&gt;Perl in a couple of hours that would have taken me days or weeks to do&lt;br /&gt;in Lisp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conclusion was inescapable: the problem wasn't Perl or C++ or Java,&lt;br /&gt;it was me. I just wasn't a very good programmer any more. Lisp's power&lt;br /&gt;had made me complacent, and the world had passed me by. Looking back, I&lt;br /&gt;actually don't think I was ever a very good programmer. I just happened&lt;br /&gt;to have the good fortune to recognize a good thing when I saw it, and&lt;br /&gt;used the resulting leverage to build a successful career. But I credit&lt;br /&gt;much of my success to the people who designed Common Lisp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was nice while it lasted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;rg&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow-Ups&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

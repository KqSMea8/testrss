<title>Security alerts on GitHub</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/blog/2470-introducing-security-alerts-on-github</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Last month, we made it easier for you to keep track of the projects your code depends on with the dependency graph, currently supported in Javascript and Ruby. Today, for the over 75 percent of GitHub projects that have dependencies, we’re helping you do more than see those important projects. With your dependency graph enabled, we’ll now notify you when we detect a vulnerability in one of your dependencies and suggest known fixes from the GitHub community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/594029/32851987-76c36e4a-c9eb-11e7-98fc-feb39fddaadb.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/594029/32851987-76c36e4a-c9eb-11e7-98fc-feb39fddaadb.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Security Alerts &amp;amp; Suggested Fix&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to start using security alerts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether your projects are private or public, security alerts get vital vulnerability information to the right people on your team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enable your dependency graph&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public repositories will automatically have your dependency graph and security alerts enabled. For private repositories, you’ll need to opt in to security alerts in your repository settings or by allowing access in the Dependency graph section of your repository’s Insights tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set notification preferences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your dependency graph is enabled, admins will receive security alerts by default. Admins can also add teams or individuals as recipients for security alerts in the dependency graph settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respond to alerts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we notify you about a potential vulnerability, we’ll highlight any dependencies that we recommend updating. If a known safe version exists, we’ll select one using machine learning and publicly available data, and include it in our suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vulnerability coverage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vulnerabilities that have &lt;a href=&quot;https://cve.mitre.org/&quot;&gt;CVE IDs&lt;/a&gt; (publicly disclosed vulnerabilities from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nvd.nist.gov/&quot;&gt;National Vulnerability Database&lt;/a&gt;) will be included in security alerts. However, not all vulnerabilities have CVE IDs—even many publicly disclosed vulnerabilities don't have them. We'll continue to get better at identifying vulnerabilities as our security data grows. For more help managing security issues, check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/marketplace/category/security&quot;&gt;security partners in the GitHub Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the next step in using the world’s largest collection of open source data to help you keep code safer and do your best work. The dependency graph and security alerts currently support Javascript and Ruby—with Python support coming in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Startup Ideas</title>
<link>http://blog.ycombinator.com/13-startup-ideas/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.ycombinator.com/13-startup-ideas/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Hey, my name is Kyle Corbitt and I’m a software developer at Y Combinator. I spend most of my time creating software to support our founders as they build their businesses. Before joining YC I ran my own startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in high school, I sometimes got the frustrating feeling that all of the good startup ideas had been taken before I had a chance to work on them myself. As I’ve gotten a bit older and gained more experience, I’ve found that valuable startup ideas aren’t actually a scarce resource. In fact, they’re only becoming more abundant — as the world moves faster and more new businesses are created, more novel niches appear for profitable, productive companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, we asked YC alumni and staff for startup ideas that they wish existed but aren’t currently working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interested in pursuing one of these ideas? Please get in touch at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:kyle@ycombinator.com&quot;&gt;kyle@ycombinator.com&lt;/a&gt; — I’d love to chat about your plans, and I may be able to put you in touch with the idea’s author or other good resources. Also, if you have your own great idea that you’d like to see in a future version of this list, let me know! If we see community interest we’re thinking about creating a larger repository for ideas like these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI for Communicating with Dogs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use the immense amount of video footage captures of interactions with dogs to predict what behaviors will happen based on what the dog is doing i.e. predict that your dog is in pain, or hungry or thirsty etc. (Note: this might sound a little crazy but this has been done already for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/06/artificial-intelligence-learns-spot-pain-sheep&quot;&gt;identifying pain in sheep&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elizabeth Iorns, Science Exchange S11&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart Bathroom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Healthcare in the U.S. is a $3.2 trillion industry. Individuals take care of most of their health needs in the bathroom (bms, urine, teeth, hygiene, et cetera). All this data is literally flushed down the drain. Big opportunity to install a virtual doctor’s office in everyone’s bathroom, collecting data and providing feedback to help people reduce cost on health and wellness while achieving much better outcomes. New types of sensors and great data analysis and UX is needed to make the smart bathrooms a reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breck Yunits, NudgePad S09&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accounts Receivables as a Service&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It can be a huge pain to get enterprises to pay their vendors, even after contracts are signed. It’s one of those business inefficiencies that they’re not inclined to fix because there’s little downside to them paying late. Handing it off to a “collections agency” seems aggressive and most startups won’t do it, but I think something like an outsourced AR service that appears to be from the company but is actually a third party could be great. Potentially a mix of $/mo+% of revenue or $/mo depending at different tiers depending on how many transactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yuri Sagalov, AeroFS S10/Y Combinator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baby Bidet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A semi-automatic baby bidet where you could sit them over the sink and clean out the yuck simply and without having to touch it. Could work well as a kickstarter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jeffrey Engler, Wright Electric W17&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Securitized Assets on the Blockchain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I would be working on making it easier to securitize and create a market for unique assets on the blockchain. There are many types of new securities and types of assets being created, not only tokens but anything else that can be bought or sold. In theory you could sell those on the blockchain currently, but you’d have to spin up and create your own blockchain in its entirety. It seems like that’s something you should be able to do as a service; I have some asset and I’d like a blockchain for it, and I’ll pay a monthly fee. I’d build that if I had time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Austen Allred, Lambda School S17&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renewable Energy from Engineered Microbes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microbes are outstandingly powerful and have the potential to be engineered to do almost anything. If I had more time, I would love to look more into the idea of engineering a bacteria that could efficiently convert a renewable resource into a usable fuel. Obviously, many microbes already exist that can do this, and so I would like to do more research into why this is not an option in common practice yet, and what strategies could be developed to make it possible here and now. Is the problem that the fuels they are making are incompatible with our current infrastructure (e.g. the microbes make ethanol, and most cars run on gas)? Or is the problem that bugs that can make usable fuel do so inefficiently, and thus need to be engineered to produce sufficient quantities in a cost-effective manner and/or on a reasonable time scale? In short, what problem(s) need to be solved to utilize microbes as fuel sources?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zack Abbott, Z-Biotics Fellowship&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adwords for Outdoor and Transit Advertising&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Billboards are still sold manually by sales teams. You literally cannot buy a billboard online. If people could buy them as easily as you buy an Adwords ad, maybe many more small companies would.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jared Friedman, Scribd S06/Y Combinator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design on Demand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upload a photo of furniture of a piece of home decor, and select between “find” or “match” options. The “find” option would bring up very similar options and let you sort by price point and delivery time, so you could find the Crate and Barrel knock off of that designer table you saw in a magazine. The “match” option would recommends items that go well stylistically with that item. All of that instantly delivered through an app or website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kathryn Minshew, The Muse W12&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low-Friction Lending Library&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most people end up accumulating dozens or hundreds of items that they only need a few times a year. In my case these are things like camping equipment, a soldering iron, an electric drill, paper cutter, etc. — but everybody has their own unique list. I’d much rather not have to keep track of all this infrequently-used inventory and instead rent it on demand, especially since I have limited storage space. Lending libraries for this type of stuff exist but are too high-friction to be popular today — it’s substantially easier to just buy something on Amazon than rent it from a local depot. I think with automated inventory management and (potentially) sidewalk delivery bots the cost and friction can be brought low enough to turn this into a popular and defensible subscription business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kyle Corbitt, Y Combinator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Technology Relatable and Accessible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technology is advancing at a rapid pace and it can be overwhelming and scary for people that don’t understand the underlying principles or have a safe place to ask questions and be taught. Think about how frustrated you get trying to explain to your grandfather why Facebook isn’t working when the Wi-Fi isn’t connected and what wi-fi is or browsers are. This is most pronounced with seniors but applies also to lots of people that don’t work in tech. It is only getting worse with topics like AI and cryptocurrency. Build a service that makes technology accessible and not scary for older or non tech savvy people. We need a text/call and software based solution with really great people on the other end who don’t judge, but explain concepts simply — someone who will help and doesn’t make anyone feel dumb. Ultimately the goal would be to make people of all types more technologically conversant while build ing a membership and/or e-commerce business model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avni Patel Thompson, Poppy W16&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buyer’s Remorse Insurance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Money back guarantee for art buyers: Buying fine art has a steep learning curve. Firstly, galleries are very uninviting. Then, when you get inside, the sales process is super unclear. A final barrier is that art is very arbitrarily priced, and as a new buyer it’s hard to know if you will get buyer’s remorse and feel like you overpaid for something. To overcome this, offer insurance that galleries can offer to buy art back from the purchaser if the purchaser is unsatisfied. Lowered risk for buyers =&amp;gt; Increased spend, and you take some of that increased revenue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Justin Kan, Justin.TV/Twitch W07&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Network for Children&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a super tough nut to crack. You have to be cool and offer a safe and private environment for kids to communicate with each other while enabling trusted adults to peer in/interact, etc… The company that can build something that is used and useful for all parties can build something of great value throughout a person’s entire life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Holly Liu, Kabam/Y Combinator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modern Firefighting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Climate change is already having real consequences on our society, and this year has been one of the worst years for wildfire in history, leaving entire neighborhoods flattened. Fire fighting and the tools we use to fight fires haven’t changed much in 100 years. Sprinklers were a big innovation for homes, but forest fires are often spotted and fought in the same way we did many decades ago. With the arrival of autonomous drones, industrial drones, better sensors and better prediction we should be able do a better job saving our forests, cities and firefighters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gustaf Alstromer, Y Combinator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Apology after Japanese train departs 20 seconds early</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image copyright&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;article-image__copyright&quot;&gt;AFP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;Japan has one of the world's most reliable railways&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;amp-o-paragraph--bold&quot;&gt;A rail company in Japan has apologised after one of its trains departed 20 seconds early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;amp-o-paragraph&quot;&gt;Management on the Tsukuba Express line between Tokyo and the city of Tsukuba say they &quot;sincerely apologise for the inconvenience&quot; caused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;amp-o-paragraph&quot;&gt;In a statement, &lt;a class=&quot;amp-o-link&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mir.co.jp/company/release/2017/post_109.html&quot;&gt;the company said the train had been scheduled to leave at 9:44:40 local time but left at 9:44:20.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;amp-o-paragraph&quot;&gt;Many social media users reacted to the company's apology with surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;amp-o-social-embed&quot;&gt;
&lt;div fallback=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;amp-o-social-embed&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;amp-o-social-embed--unavailable&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;amp-o-paragraph&quot;&gt;The mistake happened because staff had not checked the timetable, the company statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;amp-o-paragraph&quot;&gt;&quot;The crew did not sufficiently check the departure time and performed the departure operation,&quot; it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;amp-o-paragraph&quot;&gt;It added that no customers had complained about the early departure from Minami Nagareyama Station, which is just north of Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;amp-o-paragraph&quot;&gt;The Tsukuba Express line takes passengers from Akihabara in eastern Tokyo to Tsukuba in about 45 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;amp-o-paragraph&quot;&gt;It is rare for trains in Japan, which has one of the world's most reliable railways, to depart at a different time to the one scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;amp-o-paragraph&quot;&gt;The country's Tokaido line, which runs from Tokyo to the city of Kobe, is by far the world's busiest and carries nearly 150 million passengers a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;amp-o-paragraph&quot;&gt;Impressed railway users worldwide tweeted the story to their local train operators - particularly in Britain, where rail services are often delayed.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Bootstrapping My Side Project to $6k/Month</title>
<link>https://www.indiehackers.com/@EO/how-i-bootstrapped-my-side-project-to-6k-mo-hating-everything-it-stood-for-43c35faa25</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.indiehackers.com/@EO/how-i-bootstrapped-my-side-project-to-6k-mo-hating-everything-it-stood-for-43c35faa25</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;medium-insert-images medium-insert-images-overhang&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/indie-hackers.appspot.com/articles/aW72cKGwcWWLmE9O6mNZUNh4Lug1/@EO%7C43c35faa25/sept-earnings.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;medium-insert-image-active&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Every story that starts with “How I bootstrapped…”, is a happy story. Nobody ever bootstrapped a product to profitability and felt bad about it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;da89&quot; id=&quot;da89&quot;&gt;This is different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8cc0&quot; id=&quot;8cc0&quot;&gt;This is the long story of how I built and grew &lt;a href=&quot;https://appygen.net?utm_source=indiehackers_story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;AppyGEN&lt;/a&gt;’s revenue to 6k+/month. And why I started hating it while still working full time on it, and how you can avoid going through the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;432b&quot; id=&quot;432b&quot;&gt;AppyGEN is a native Android app builder, designed for internet marketers, or more specifically: non-developers looking to make money online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;432b&quot; id=&quot;432b&quot;&gt;It was launched in 2014, and since that time, I’ve done my best to keep it under the radar and basically never talk about it to anyone who was not a potential customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How it all started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2fc7&quot; id=&quot;2fc7&quot;&gt;I’ve always loved building stuff. I made my first $1000 at 14, selling remote administration tools to wannabe hackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;45c4&quot; id=&quot;45c4&quot;&gt;So in 2012, while pursuing my college degree (in France) and struggling to pay my rent, I started taking remote freelance dev jobs whenever I could. I was making a substantial amount of money for a broke 22 year old, doing what I loved. I even started investing some of it in online poker, heck, I even built a bot to play for me (didn’t work out though).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cc0c&quot; id=&quot;cc0c&quot;&gt;After saving enough to pay my debts and some more to sustain my lifestyle, I decided that I could do this for a long time. So I dropped out, and went back to my home country (Morocco) where the cost of living was about 5 times cheaper than France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8403&quot; id=&quot;8403&quot;&gt;Fast forward to a few months later, I had amassed enough money to live comfortably for the next two years. But with all my friends working on their 9 to 5 jobs all day, I got bored pretty fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0a52&quot; id=&quot;0a52&quot;&gt;So, I decided to start a company (with a friend) and bring the startup mindset to traditional small businesses. I remember thinking: I’ll be the first to do this so I’ll definitely have an edge in the long run. (Spoiler alert: Didn’t work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fa2a&quot; id=&quot;fa2a&quot;&gt;We had the bright idea to sell a customer &amp;amp; appointment management software to doctors who were still using pen and paper at the time (Nope, not even excel). We sold a few copies, but it quickly became obvious that most of them didn’t need our tool, there was no market for our product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;dc36&quot; id=&quot;dc36&quot;&gt;After that, we tried making a cool b2c app startup. We had no experience in mobile dev but it was fun learning everything from scratch. A few months later, we had 10.000+ users on our app, but not enough revenue. Ad revenue was too low to keep us afloat and eventually, we ran out of money to pay the office rent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;41c2&quot; id=&quot;41c2&quot;&gt;With no money and no vision for the future, we were back to square one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;medium-insert-images medium-insert-images-inline&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/indie-hackers.appspot.com/articles/aW72cKGwcWWLmE9O6mNZUNh4Lug1/@EO%7C43c35faa25/startup-failure-hyphon-music-group.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The inception of AppyGEN&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;65ba&quot; id=&quot;65ba&quot;&gt;One night, in an effort to sharpen his Android dev skills, my partner built a simple app with a list of videos, targeting a specific trending niche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;afbc&quot; id=&quot;afbc&quot;&gt;In a matter of days, we were up to thousands of downloads from all around the world. The RPM (Revenue per 1000 impressions) was high, and almost overnight we started making a good amount of money just from the ads in that single app. So we thought, let’s make more of those apps!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6405&quot; id=&quot;6405&quot;&gt;There was no need for us to spend months building an original startupy app, we could just make similarly simple apps and make a ton of money!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b07c&quot; id=&quot;b07c&quot;&gt;And it worked, a month later we had enough money to pay our rent for the rest of the year. I loved automating stuff, especially if it could make me money and save me time at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9170&quot; id=&quot;9170&quot;&gt;So we turned our apps into templates and I made a tool where we could just input the app name, icon and content, click a button, and get a native &amp;amp; profitable app, ready to be published. We used the tool to make dozens of those apps until we ran out of niches to target. Since we had enough money coming in, there was no real motivation to keep doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;04f9&quot; id=&quot;04f9&quot;&gt;As an experiment, we’ve decided to turn our tool into a product and sell it to people looking to make money online, and I knew just the place: &lt;a href=&quot;https://warriorforum.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Warrior Forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2333&quot; id=&quot;2333&quot;&gt;We wrote a PDF to teach the process of finding niches to target, monetizing and publishing the apps on the play store. And started selling v1 for a whopping $49 lifetime payment, including updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;71b5&quot; id=&quot;71b5&quot;&gt;Here’s an old video of one of the early versions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;medium-insert-embeds&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;medium-insert-embed&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/d8DfNbJHY_U&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e75f&quot; id=&quot;e75f&quot;&gt;Embarrassing right? Not to the members of the warrior forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e75f&quot; id=&quot;e75f&quot;&gt;They were so used to overpriced bullshit courses that they couldn’t believe this simple, cheap software was helping them make a consistent and recurring revenue in a matter of days!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;da32&quot; id=&quot;da32&quot;&gt;They loved it and sales skyrocketed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;743f&quot; id=&quot;743f&quot;&gt;We’ve updated the tool a few more times and raised the price to $97 per license. I loved reading the reviews and getting emails from our customers saying we’ve changed their lives. I wanted to do this forever, and quickly stopped pursuing the original vision of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fdad&quot; id=&quot;fdad&quot;&gt;On the other hand, my partner who didn’t get to work on AppyGEN or enjoy it as much as I did started losing interest. So I bought his shares, and he went off to do his own thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where’s my recurring revenue ?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;450f&quot; id=&quot;450f&quot;&gt;A few months later after me and my partner parted ways, sales started dwindling and I had to take another freelance gig to make some extra money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b448&quot; id=&quot;b448&quot;&gt;One day, I was having a conversation with one of AppyGEN’s customers and he shared with me his ad revenue on Skype. This guy had made hundreds of apps in less than two months, and was making 10 times what I was making from the software sales!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f774&quot; id=&quot;f774&quot;&gt;I was blown away, and to be honest, I also felt entitled to some of it. And that’s when it dawned on me. Why was I giving away lifetime licenses to a tool that helps you make money every month ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;deac&quot; id=&quot;deac&quot;&gt;The answer was simple: I had no real experience in entrepreneurship, pricing, marketing or growth. All I knew how to do was build stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b2c8&quot; id=&quot;b2c8&quot;&gt;So I dropped my freelance gig, and embarked on a 6 month journey to learn everything about startups &amp;amp; entrepreneurship, as well as sharpen my web development and sysadmin skills. By the end of the learning phase I had a solid plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;4ac9&quot; id=&quot;4ac9&quot;&gt;To turn the software into a SaaS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;46f2&quot; id=&quot;46f2&quot;&gt;To have a free plan where users could make and monetize apps in exchange for a cut from their ad revenue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;ee81&quot; id=&quot;ee81&quot;&gt;To have a paid plan for users who want to keep 100% of their ad inventory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;medium-insert-images medium-insert-images-inline&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/indie-hackers.appspot.com/articles/aW72cKGwcWWLmE9O6mNZUNh4Lug1/@EO%7C43c35faa25/5-best-books-for-startups-and-growth-hackers.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;It wasn’t easy. I had to figure out a way to compile native Android apps on the cloud (emphasis on native), and handle the ton of traffic pouring in from the apps, in real time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2123&quot; id=&quot;2123&quot;&gt;I also had to keep my promise to the hundreds of early adopters who purchased the lifetime plan when the software didn’t have any server costs, and basically just give them premium features and 100% of their revenue for life (including the thousands apps guy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e9d7&quot; id=&quot;e9d7&quot;&gt;I stopped selling the desktop software and spent another six months building the web platform. It was an extremely fulfilling experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SaaS is hard, making money from free users is even harder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;024b&quot; id=&quot;024b&quot;&gt;The web platform was ready mid 2015, I silently launched a beta to the existing (lifetime) customers and they helped me eliminate the bugs I had missed. At that point, I thought it was a done deal. All I had to do was drive some traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;afa7&quot; id=&quot;afa7&quot;&gt;Since users could sign up for free, I wouldn’t even have to invest time in converting them to paid users or optimizing the funnel. I’d be sharing their ad revenue and making money wether they upgrade to a paid account or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a430&quot; id=&quot;a430&quot;&gt;But still, I wasn’t very confident about my ability to manage tons of API calls from every app made through the software. So I decided to soft launch to a small audience of 200 people who had signed up to the waiting list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d4b0&quot; id=&quot;d4b0&quot;&gt;This part was only supposed to take a few weeks. Just enough time for the new users to build and publish some apps and make sure that the platform does not break down under heavy load. It ended up taking months before I could get those users to publish any apps at all. There were so many things I didn’t account for, more specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;38fd&quot; id=&quot;38fd&quot;&gt;Cumbersome Onboarding: Getting someone who had no development or app experience from “I want to make money online” to “I just published my first app on the play store” to “I just made my first dollar” was extremely hard to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;4cb7&quot; id=&quot;4cb7&quot;&gt;I had to figure out a way to teach users how to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;dc6d&quot; id=&quot;dc6d&quot;&gt;Research for profitable niches find or create copyright-free content for their apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;7ca7&quot; id=&quot;7ca7&quot;&gt;Create a developer account on Google Play Store (And convincing them to pay the $25 fee before they made a cent)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;1cf7&quot; id=&quot;1cf7&quot;&gt;Publish apps and do app store optimization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;6d54&quot; id=&quot;6d54&quot;&gt;Also, free users lack motivation. I never had that issue with the early adopters, most likely because they paid a price to use the tool. No matter how small that price was, they weren’t going to just drop everything whenever they stumble along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f9d8&quot; id=&quot;f9d8&quot;&gt;The new users, not so much. At the slightest whim, like “Create an icon for your app”, or “Pay the $25 google play developer fee”, they’d just close everything and disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;medium-insert-images medium-insert-images-inline&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/indie-hackers.appspot.com/articles/aW72cKGwcWWLmE9O6mNZUNh4Lug1/@EO%7C43c35faa25/churn-header.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e13c&quot; id=&quot;e13c&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;So I was back at square one again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;497a&quot; id=&quot;497a&quot;&gt;After spending almost a year working my ass off, I still had no recurring revenue, new server costs, and a shitload of subtle obstacles I didn’t account for and had no idea how to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Self-doubt and not changing the world like everyone else&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e796&quot; id=&quot;e796&quot;&gt;AppyGEN was taking a toll on my personal life. I had previously disabled all my social networks to focus on it, and more than a year had gone by with nothing to show for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d329&quot; id=&quot;d329&quot;&gt;Reading the successes of other simpler products made me angry at myself, why did I have to go after such a complicated project ? Couldn’t I have just made a to-do list app ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3a31&quot; id=&quot;3a31&quot;&gt;I also came to the conclusion that AppyGEN didn’t really help make the world a better place like every other startup I read about. It seemed to me like it was just making the play store a worse place, helping non-developers publish hundreds of unoriginal apps that only took away from the visibility and chances of more ambitious apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e711&quot; id=&quot;e711&quot;&gt;I was myself an app developer once and I could clearly see how my product ultimately harmed other developers. I started hating everything AppyGEN stands for, no matter how much money it continued to make for my existing customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;medium-insert-images medium-insert-images-inline&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/indie-hackers.appspot.com/articles/aW72cKGwcWWLmE9O6mNZUNh4Lug1/@EO%7C43c35faa25/20170802205551-GettyImages-691046381.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ad43&quot; id=&quot;ad43&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;But what else could I do ? I had already invested so much of my time into it, and I knew for a fact that it could eventually become a profitable business, plus I needed the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a399&quot; id=&quot;a399&quot;&gt;I had learned so much in the process of building the platform, and for that I was grateful. There was still a lot to learn too, and I was confident it would serve me well in my future ventures. So I decided to secretly keep working on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5909&quot; id=&quot;5909&quot;&gt;Whenever someone would ask me what I’m working on, I’d say I’m freelancing. Whenever I’d get a freelancing offer, I’d turn it down saying I had too much on my plate right now. Gone were the days where I would proudly say that I’m building an awesome SaaS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Onboarding and motivating free users&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;efa2&quot; id=&quot;efa2&quot;&gt;I did my best to optimize the onboarding process as much as I could. Which was not enough considering the fact that users still had to do some work in order to be able to generate unique apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ac1a&quot; id=&quot;ac1a&quot;&gt;I didn’t want every app made through the software to look the same, and I knew there was no way they would be able to make an income just copying existing or demo apps. They had to invest some time in reading the tutorials, doing research, creating icons and assets, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;532f&quot; id=&quot;532f&quot;&gt;So I tried a bunch of things like drip campaigns, a concierge service for paid users, a forum, and a bunch of other hacks I had read about in case studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a0bc&quot; id=&quot;a0bc&quot;&gt;Although these things did help decrease churn a little bit, it wasn’t enough. Only about 5% of new users would get to the point where they got value from the software to invest more of their time in building apps and growing their revenue (and mine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a73e&quot; id=&quot;a73e&quot;&gt;You’d think that if you promised someone they’d make a consistent, growing and recurring income, without requiring any upfront investment, they’d be all over it day and night. It wasn’t an onboarding or engagement problem, it was a motivation problem. And it took me some time to figure this out since none of the churned users would answer my emails when I reached out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b204&quot; id=&quot;b204&quot;&gt;Completely burned out and disenchanted, I decided I’d try one last thing before giving up: &lt;strong&gt;Gamification&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1e0b&quot; id=&quot;1e0b&quot;&gt;The idea was to turn the whole thing into a game, where you learn a bunch of stuff about making profitable apps, build your app portfolio, and grow your ad revenue. All at the same time, while having fun and competing with other members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8816&quot; id=&quot;8816&quot;&gt;It felt like the perfect (and only) answer to all my problems, so I scrapped about 50% of the existing code and re-wrote it in a way that made gamification an essential and required part of the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;53d8&quot; id=&quot;53d8&quot;&gt;New users would automatically be assigned a “rank” and two or three “missions” they needed to complete in order to move to the next level, every mission had a step by step tutorial on how to complete it and every time a user gets to a higher level, they’d get rewarded with a new rank and a shiny badge icon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;167b&quot; id=&quot;167b&quot;&gt;Users could see their progress in real time and compete for the top 10 spots on the leaderboard, automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3c67&quot; id=&quot;3c67&quot;&gt;It worked great and everyone loved it! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3c67&quot; id=&quot;3c67&quot;&gt;Here's a screenshot of the new gamified dashboard:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;medium-insert-images medium-insert-images-inline&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/indie-hackers.appspot.com/articles/aW72cKGwcWWLmE9O6mNZUNh4Lug1/@EO%7C43c35faa25/Screen%20Shot%202017-11-04%20at%202.41.51%20PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;medium-insert-images-inline&quot;&gt;Dividing the onboarding process in terms of “levels” also helped me figure out (thanks to mixpanel’s analytics) that anyone who got to level 3 in the first week, would most likely keep coming back, making more apps, and eventually making his first dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;68b3&quot; id=&quot;68b3&quot; class=&quot;medium-insert-images-inline&quot;&gt;It was one of those amazing Aha moments that got me into entrepreneurship in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;adf7&quot; id=&quot;adf7&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Before I knew it, the conversion rate from new user to active user (level 3+) skyrocketed from 5% to 45%. I could finally start driving traffic to the site and working on other things like acquisition and retention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Growing slowly, quietly and automatically&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fd94&quot; id=&quot;fd94&quot;&gt;By the end of 2016, we had 1000+ active users and monthly revenue had reached a consistent $3k+/Month for the past 6 months. 70% of it from sharing the ad revenue of free users, and 30% from paid subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;febb&quot; id=&quot;febb&quot;&gt;I couldn’t understand why users who were making a thousand dollars in ad revenue each month, didn’t upgrade their accounts, after all it only costs $25. Turns out, a lot of these users were living in countries where they couldn’t have a Visa card or PayPal account, and just couldn’t pay me even if they wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;29ae&quot; id=&quot;29ae&quot;&gt;In terms of revenue, this worked out fine for me, I’d probably be making a lot less money without the rev-share plan and I wouldn’t have been able to offer the service for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a570&quot; id=&quot;a570&quot;&gt;Remember earlier when I said I hated what AppyGEN stands for ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recurring revenue didn’t fix that, I still felt too self conscious about the whole thing, and I would constantly think about it whenever I was working on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;54a0&quot; id=&quot;54a0&quot;&gt;It’s hard growing a business you hate, no matter how much money it made or could make. But I couldn’t just ignore it and be contented with the current revenue, hoping it will never drop. It happened once. One of my biggest earners had lost his play store account due to policy violations and overnight the revenue dropped to 2K until the same guy decided to get back at it. So I had to keep a continuous flow of new users at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f6d7&quot; id=&quot;f6d7&quot;&gt;I sucked at SEO and paid advertising. Press, social and content marketing were out of the question since it would put me and the software in front of all kinds of readers, and I wasn’t ready for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5705&quot; id=&quot;5705&quot;&gt;In retrospect, a bunch of my worries were exclusively in my head, but that’s what you get when you spend years keeping your work to yourself, convinced that what you’re doing is bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4bdc&quot; id=&quot;4bdc&quot;&gt;Although I still enjoyed adding new features, I still felt bad about sharing it with the world, and acquisition is all about sharing nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9425&quot; id=&quot;9425&quot;&gt;So I came up with the idea to get my users to share it, so that I didn’t have to. To do so, I set up a very enticing referral program:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;a58b&quot; id=&quot;a58b&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users could share their referral link and get a 10% cut of the ad revenue from every app the referred user makes, forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b4f6&quot; id=&quot;b4f6&quot;&gt;For example, if user A brings in user B, and user B makes an app that brings in $10/day, user A would get $1 every day without lifting a finger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If user B decides to upgrade to a premium account, user A would get a commission every time user B pays his subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c89c&quot; id=&quot;c89c&quot;&gt;And it worked, some users even stopped making apps and focused solely on referring new users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;149b&quot; id=&quot;149b&quot;&gt;A few months later, AppyGEN’s revenue doubled to reach $6k+/Month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;28b1&quot; id=&quot;28b1&quot;&gt;Today, I am actually grateful that AppyGEN is bringing in enough money for me to work on whatever I want. But more importantly, I am so grateful about the hard lessons I learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;169c&quot; id=&quot;169c&quot;&gt;Hopefully, you were able to extract some of those lessons through this post. If not, here are the most important rules you should keep in mind for your next project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;ea4d&quot; id=&quot;ea4d&quot;&gt;Making money should never be your main motivation when working on something new.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;ef90&quot; id=&quot;ef90&quot;&gt;Never, ever, keep your work to yourself. Share as much as you can, as soon as you can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;68a5&quot; id=&quot;68a5&quot;&gt;Build something you’d be proud of 5 years from now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;cfd0&quot; id=&quot;cfd0&quot;&gt;If you have questions or want to get in touch or want to work with me on something, I’d love to chat. Email me (eothmane.io[at]gmail.com), follow me on Twitter (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/get_eo&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/get_eo&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@get_eo&lt;/a&gt;) &amp;amp; Medium (&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@e_othmane&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@e_othmane&quot; data-anchor-type=&quot;2&quot; data-user-id=&quot;2ba9d4a65efd&quot; data-action-value=&quot;2ba9d4a65efd&quot; data-action=&quot;show-user-card&quot; data-action-type=&quot;hover&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Othmane E.&lt;/a&gt;), or leave a comment below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different operating systems have long catered to different audiences: Windows for the business professional, Mac for the creative professional and Linux for the software developer. For OS providers, this sort of market segmentation greatly simplified product vision, technical requirements, user experience and marketing direction. However, it also reinforced workplace norms which bucket individuals into narrow, non-overlapping domains: business people can offer no insight into the creative process, and developers no insight into business problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, knowledge and skill are fluid, spanning multiple disciplines and fields. The notion that &quot;you can only be good at one thing&quot; is not a roadmap to mastery but rather a prescription for premature optimization. You can only know what you're good at once you've sampled a lot of things - &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://tim.blog/2007/09/14/the-top-5-reasons-to-be-a-jack-of-all-trades/&quot;&gt;and you may just find that you're good at a lot of them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://alexpetralia.com/posts/2017/6/8/hard-skills-for-modern-business-analyst&quot;&gt;modern business analysts&lt;/a&gt;, bridging the gap between business and software development is especially important. Business analysts must be &quot;dual platform,&quot; able to leverage command-line tools available only on Linux (or OS X) yet still benefit from the power of Microsoft Office on Windows. Understandably, the world of Linux is intimidating for those with a business degree. Fortunately, as with most things, you only need to learn 20% of the information to accomplish 80% of the work. Here is my 20%.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why modern business analysts should know Linux&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to its open source roots, Linux benefited from the contributions of thousands of developers over time. They built programs and utilities not only to make their jobs easier, but also the jobs of programmers who followed them. As a result, open source development created a network effect: the more developers built utilities on the platform, the more other developers could leverage those utilities to write their programs right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What resulted was an expansive suite of programs and utilities (collectively, software) that were written in Linux, for Linux - much of which was never ported to Windows. One example of this is the popular version control system (VCS) called &lt;em&gt;git&lt;/em&gt;. Developers &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have written this software to work on Windows, but they didn't. They wrote it to work on the command line for Linux because it was the ecosystem which already had all the tools they needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concretely, development on Windows runs into two main problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Basic tasks, like file parsing, job scheduling, and text search are more involved than running a command-line utility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programming languages (eg. Python, C++) and their associated code libraries will throw errors because they are expecting certain Linux parameters or file system locations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, this means more time spent rewriting basic tools already available in Linux and troubleshooting OS compatibility errors. This is not a surprise - the Windows ecosystem simply wasn't designed with software development in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the case made for Linux development, let's begin with the basics.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fundamental unit of Linux: the &quot;shell&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;shell&lt;/strong&gt; (also known as the terminal, console or command line) is a text-based user interface through which commands are sent to the machine. On Linux, the shell's default language is called &lt;strong&gt;bash&lt;/strong&gt;. Unlike Windows users who primarily point-and-click inside of windows, Linux developers stick to their keyboard and type commands into the shell. While this transition is at first unnatural for those without a programming background, the benefits of developing in Linux easily outweigh the initial learning investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning the few important concepts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to a full-fledged programming language, bash only has a few major concepts that need to be learned. Once these are covered, the rest of bash is just memorization. I'll restate for clarity: &lt;strong&gt;being good at bash is simply memorizing about 20-30 commands and their most common arguments&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux seems impenetrable to non-developers because of the way that developers seem to effortlessly regurgitate esoteric terminal commands at will. The reality is that they committed only a few dozen commands to memory - for anything more complicated, they too (like all mere mortals) consult Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way, here are the main concepts in bash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Command syntax&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commands follow the syntax of: {command} {arguments..}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in 'grep -inr', &lt;em&gt;grep&lt;/em&gt; is the command (to search for a string of text) and &lt;em&gt;-inr&lt;/em&gt; are flags/arguments which change what grep does by default. The only way to learn what these mean is to look them up through Google or by typing 'man grep'. I recommend learning the commands and their most common arguments together; it's too burdensome otherwise to remember what each and every flag does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Directory aliases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The present directory (ie. where am I?): .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The parent directory of the present directory: ..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user's home directory: ~&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The file system root (or the parent of all parents): /&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, to change from the current directory to the parent directory, one would type: &quot;cd ..&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, to copy a file located at &quot;/path/to/file.txt&quot; into the present directory, one would enter &quot;cp /path/to/file.txt .&quot; (note the period at the end of the command). Since these are no more than aliases, the actual path name could be used in their place instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;STDIN / STDOUT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything you type into the window and submit (via ENTER) is called &lt;strong&gt;standard input&lt;/strong&gt; (STDIN).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything that a program prints back out to the terminal (eg. text from within a file) is called &lt;strong&gt;standard output&lt;/strong&gt; (STDOUT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Piping&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;|&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pipe takes the STDOUT of the command to the left of the pipe and makes it the STDIN to the command on the right of the pipe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;example:&lt;/strong&gt; echo 'test text' | wc -l&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A greater-than sign takes the STDOUT of the command on the left and &lt;strong&gt;writes/overwrites&lt;/strong&gt; to a new &lt;strong&gt;file&lt;/strong&gt; on the right&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;example&lt;/strong&gt;: ls &amp;gt; tmp.txt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two greater-than signs takes the STDOUT of the command on the left and &lt;strong&gt;appends&lt;/strong&gt; to a new or existing &lt;strong&gt;file&lt;/strong&gt; on the right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;example&lt;/strong&gt;: date &amp;gt;&amp;gt; tmp.txt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Wildcards&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can think of this like SQL's % symbol - for example, you might write &quot;WHERE first_name LIKE 'John%'&quot; to catch any first name starting with John.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In bash, you would write &quot;John&lt;strong&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;. If you want to list all of the files ending with &quot;.json&quot; in a folder, you would write: &quot;ls *.json&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tab completion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bash will often finish off commands intelligently for you if you start typing a command and hit your TAB key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, you should really use something like &lt;strong&gt;zsh&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;fish&lt;/strong&gt; for autocomplete since it is hard to remember the commands and all their parameters - rather, these tools will autocomplete your commands based on your command history!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quitting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime's you'll get stuck in some program and you can't get out. This is a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; frequent occurrence for beginners in Linux and it is extremely demotivating. Often, quitting has something to do with &lt;strong&gt;q&lt;/strong&gt;. It's good to memorize the following and try them all when you're trapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bash
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;CTRL+c&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;q&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python: quit()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nano: CTRL+x&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vim: &amp;lt;Esc&amp;gt; :q!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My memorized list of bash commands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the commands I use most frequently in Linux (sorted from most to least frequently used). As I mentioned before, knowing just a handful of commands will accomplish the vast majority of programmable tasks you need to perform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;cd {directory}
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;change directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ls -lha
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;list directory (verbose)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vim &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; nano
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;command line editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;touch {file}
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;create a new empty file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cp -R {original_name} {new_name}
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;copy a file or directory (and all of its contents)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mv {original_name} {new_name}
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;move or rename a file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rm {file}
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;delete a file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rm -rf {file/folder}
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;permanently delete a file or folder [use with caution!]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pwd
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;print the present working directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cat &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; less &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; tail &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; head -n10 {file}
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;STDOUT contents of a file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mkdir {directory}
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;make an empty directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;grep -inr {string}
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;find a string in any files in this directory or child directories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tabview &amp;lt;delimited_file&amp;gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;display a delimited file in columnar format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ssh {username}@{hostname}
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;connect to a remote machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tree -LhaC 3
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;show directory structure 3 levels down (with file sizes and including hidden directories)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;htop
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;task manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pip install --user {pip_package}
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Python package manager to install  packages to ~/.local/bin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pushd . ; popd ; dirs; cd -
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;push/pop/view directories onto the stack + change back to last directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sed -i &quot;s/{find}/{replace}/g&quot; {file}
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;replace a string in a file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find . -type f -name '*.txt' -exec sed -i &quot;s/{find}/{replace}/g&quot; {} \;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;replace a string for each file in this and child folders with a name like *.txt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tmux new -s session, tmux attach -t session
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;create another terminal session without creating a new window [advanced]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wget {link}
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;download a webpage or web resource&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;curl -X POST -d &quot;{key: value}&quot; http://www.google.com
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;send an HTTP request to a web server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find &amp;lt;directory&amp;gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;list all directory contents and their children, recursively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced and infrequently commands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it's good to keep a list of commands that are useful in certain situations (eg. which process is blocking a certain network port), even though those situations don't happen very often. These are some uncommon commands I keep nearby:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;lsof -i :8080
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;list open file descriptors (-i flag for network interfaces)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;netstat | head -n20
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;list currently open Internet/UNIX sockets and related information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dstat -a
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;stream current disk, network, CPU activity &amp;amp; more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nslookup &amp;lt;IP address&amp;gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;find hostname for a remote IP address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strace -f -e &amp;lt;syscall&amp;gt; &amp;lt;cmd&amp;gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;trace system calls of a program (-e flag to filter for certain system calls)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ps aux | head -n20
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;print currently active processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;file &amp;lt;file&amp;gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;check what a file type is (eg. executable, binary, ASCII-text file)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;uname -a
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;kernel information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lsb_release -a
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;OS information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hostname
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;check the hostname of your machine (ie. the name so other computers can reach you)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pstree
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;visualize process forks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;time &amp;lt;cmd&amp;gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;execute a command and report statistics about how long it took&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CTRL + z ; bg; jobs; fg
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;send a process in current tty into background and back to foreground&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cat file.txt | xargs -n1 | sort | uniq -c
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;count unique words in a file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wc -l &amp;lt;file&amp;gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;line count in a file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;du -ha
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;show size on disk for directories and their contents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zcat &amp;lt;file.gz&amp;gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;display contents of a zipped text file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scp &amp;lt;user@remote_host&amp;gt; &amp;lt;local_path&amp;gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;copy a file from remote to local server, or vice versa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;man {command}
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;show manual (ie. documentation) for a command, but you're probably better off using Google&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<description>&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;35&quot;&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the Federal Communications Commission is set to unveil plans next week for a final vote to reverse a landmark 2015 net neutrality order barring the blocking or slowing of web content, two people briefed on the plans said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;43&quot;&gt;In May, the FCC voted 2-1 to advance Republican FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s plan to withdraw the former Obama administration’s order reclassifying internet service providers as if they were utilities. Pai now plans to hold a final vote on the proposal at the FCC’s Dec. 14 meeting, the people said, and roll out details of the plans next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;44&quot;&gt;Pai asked in May for public comment on whether the FCC has authority or should keep any regulations limiting internet providers’ ability to block, throttle or offer “fast lanes” to some websites, known as “paid prioritization.” Several industry officials told Reuters they expect Pai to drop those specific legal requirements but retain some transparency requirements under the order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;45&quot;&gt;An FCC spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;46&quot;&gt;Internet providers including AT&amp;amp;T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc say ending the rules could spark billions in additional broadband investment and eliminate the possibility a future administration could regulate internet pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;47&quot;&gt;Critics say the move could harm consumers, small businesses and access to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;48&quot;&gt;In July, a group representing major technology firms including Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc urged Pai to drop plans to rescind the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;49&quot;&gt;Advocacy group Free Press said Wednesday “we’ll learn the gory details in the next few days, but we know that Pai intends to dismantle the basic protections that have fueled the internet’s growth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;50&quot;&gt;Pai, who argues the Obama order was unnecessary and harms jobs and investment, has not committed to retaining any rules, but said he favors an “open internet.” The proposal to reverse the Obama rules reclassifying internet service has drawn more than 22 million comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;51&quot;&gt;Pai is mounting an aggressive deregulatory agenda since being named by President Donald Trump to head the FCC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;52&quot;&gt;On Thursday the FCC will vote on Pai’s proposal to eliminate the 42-year-old ban on cross-ownership of a newspaper and TV station in a major market. The proposal would make it easier for media companies to buy additional TV stations in the same market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;53&quot;&gt;Pai is also expected to call for an initial vote in December to rescind rules that say one company may not own stations serving more than 39 percent of U.S. television households, two people briefed on the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;49&quot;&gt;The RISC-V port was just merged to Linux a few minutes ago.  This means we will&lt;br /&gt;be in the 4.15 release, which should be out about 10 weeks from last Sunday.  &lt;br /&gt;As soon as the tarballs are created, the RISC-V Linux ABI will be stable, and&lt;br /&gt;since we'll ideally be in a glibc release that comes out soon after that we'll&lt;br /&gt;be fully ABI stable by early in February.&lt;p&gt;While this is a big accomplishment, it does mean we now have a clock on sorting&lt;br /&gt;out the user-visible ABI issues.  The current problems I know of are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Signal registers are mismatched, these just need to be sanitized.&lt;br /&gt;* We're going to add some VDSO entries.&lt;br /&gt;* We need an i-cache fence system call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll be fixing these up ASAP, along with a handful of other comments and&lt;br /&gt;fallout from the merge.  If anyone else knows about any ABI weirdness in RISC-V&lt;br /&gt;Linux land then speak up soon -- if you don't, then we'll be stuck with it&lt;br /&gt;forever :).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If distribution people are interested in starting preliminary work, I've got&lt;br /&gt;backports of Linux and glibc tagged in freedom-u-sdk, which will build and boot&lt;br /&gt;a working kernel and userspace via &quot;make sim&quot;.  We won't be ready to actually&lt;br /&gt;commit to a stable ABI for a bit, so it's not quite time to start releasing&lt;br /&gt;binaries yet...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone who has helped out.  I'd specifically like to thank Albert&lt;br /&gt;Ou, who is co-maintaining Linux with me, and Arnd Bergmann, who helped review&lt;br /&gt;the port.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To anyone who is going to try out the port in its current state: good luck :).  &lt;br /&gt;The backports should be pretty solid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Yep, it's mandatory.  If you're considering building a Linux-capable RISC-V&lt;br /&gt;system right now, it'd probably be best to go with at least RV64IMAC (ideally&lt;br /&gt;RV64GC), as that's going to get the most testing -- we expect non-multilib&lt;br /&gt;distros will start with RV64GC.&lt;p&gt;When we upstream glibc, the plan is to have RV32IMAC, RV32GC, RV64IMAC, and&lt;br /&gt;RV64GC as the default multilib set.  We also expect that distros will also&lt;br /&gt;follow suit here, as those are the only glibc targets we currently test&lt;br /&gt;regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're open to expanding the number of ISAs we support in Linux land, but it&lt;br /&gt;won't happen until we at least get the current set upstream.  There's just too&lt;br /&gt;many moving parts right now, we need some time to shake out issues with what&lt;br /&gt;we've already got working.  If there's a compelling reason to start supporting&lt;br /&gt;more ISAs (ie, there's interesting hardware out there) then we can always add&lt;br /&gt;them later.  It's much harder to remove things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RISC-V port was just merged to Linux a few minutes ago.  This means we will be in the 4.15 release, which should be out about 10 weeks from last Sunday.  As soon as the tarballs are created, the RISC-V Linux ABI will be stable, and since we'll ideally be in a glibc release that comes out soon after that we'll be fully ABI stable by early in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this is a big accomplishment, it does mean we now have a clock on sorting out the user-visible ABI issues.  The current problems I know of are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Signal registers are mismatched, these just need to be sanitized.&lt;br /&gt;* We're going to add some VDSO entries.&lt;br /&gt;* We need an i-cache fence system call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll be fixing these up ASAP, along with a handful of other comments and fallout from the merge.  If anyone else knows about any ABI weirdness in RISC-V Linux land then speak up soon -- if you don't, then we'll be stuck with it forever :).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If distribution people are interested in starting preliminary work, I've got backports of Linux and glibc tagged in freedom-u-sdk, which will build and boot a working kernel and userspace via &quot;make sim&quot;.  We won't be ready to actually commit to a stable ABI for a bit, so it's not quite time to start releasing binaries yet...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone who has helped out.  I'd specifically like to thank Albert Ou, who is co-maintaining Linux with me, and Arnd Bergmann, who helped review the port.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To anyone who is going to try out the port in its current state: good luck :).  The backports should be pretty solid!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>JavaScript. The Core: 2nd Edition</title>
<link>http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/javascript-the-core-2nd-edition/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/javascript-the-core-2nd-edition/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;em&gt;second edition&lt;/em&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/javascript-the-core/&quot;&gt;JavaScript. The Core&lt;/a&gt; overview lecture, devoted to ECMAScript programming language and core components of its runtime system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audience:&lt;/strong&gt; experienced programmers, professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/javascript-the-core/&quot;&gt;first edition&lt;/a&gt; of the article covers generic aspects of JS language, using abstractions mostly from the ES3 spec, with some references to the appropriate changes in ES5 and ES6+.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting since ES2015, the specification changed descriptions and structure of some core components, introduced new models, etc. And in this edition we focus on the newer abstractions, updated terminology, but still maintaining the very basic JS structures which stay consistent throughout the spec versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article covers ES2017+ runtime system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; the latest version of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/&quot;&gt;ECMAScript specification&lt;/a&gt; can be found on the TC-39 website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start our discussion with the concept of an &lt;em&gt;object&lt;/em&gt;, which is fundamental to ECMAScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ECMAScript is an &lt;em&gt;object-oriented&lt;/em&gt; programming language, having concept of an &lt;em&gt;object&lt;/em&gt; as its core abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Def. 1: Object:&lt;/strong&gt; An &lt;em&gt;Object&lt;/em&gt; is a &lt;em&gt;collection of properties&lt;/em&gt;, and has a &lt;em&gt;single prototype object&lt;/em&gt;. The prototype may be either an object or the &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a basic example of an object. A prototype of an object is referenced by the internal &lt;code&gt;[[Prototype]]&lt;/code&gt; property, which to user-level code is exposed via the &lt;code&gt;__proto__&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
let point = {
  x: 10,
  y: 20,
};
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we have the structure with two &lt;em&gt;explicit own properties&lt;/em&gt; and one &lt;em&gt;implicit&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;__proto__&lt;/code&gt; property, which is the reference to the prototype of &lt;code&gt;point&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter figure&quot; src=&quot;http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/js-object.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 1. A basic object with a prototype.&quot; title=&quot;Figure 1. A basic object with a prototype.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;Figure 1. A basic object with a prototype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; objects may store also &lt;em&gt;symbols&lt;/em&gt;. You can get more info on symbols in &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol&quot;&gt;this documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prototype objects are used to implement &lt;em&gt;inheritance&lt;/em&gt; with the mechanism of &lt;em&gt;dynamic dispatch&lt;/em&gt;. Let’s consider the &lt;em&gt;prototype chain&lt;/em&gt; concept to see this mechanism in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every object when is created receives its &lt;em&gt;prototype&lt;/em&gt;. If the prototype is not set &lt;em&gt;explicitly&lt;/em&gt;, objects receive &lt;em&gt;default prototype&lt;/em&gt; as their &lt;em&gt;inheritance object&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Def. 2: Prototype:&lt;/strong&gt; A &lt;em&gt;Prototype&lt;/em&gt; is a delegation object used to implement &lt;em&gt;prototype-based inheritance&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explicitly the prototype can be set either by &lt;code&gt;__proto__&lt;/code&gt; property, or via &lt;code&gt;Object.create&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
// Base object.
let point = {
  x: 10,
  y: 20,
};

// Inherit from `point` object.
let point3D = {
  z: 30,
  __proto__: point,
};

console.log(
  point3D.x, // 10, inherited
  point3D.y, // 20, inherited
  point3D.z  // 30, own
);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; by default objects receive &lt;code&gt;Object.prototype&lt;/code&gt; as their inheritance object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any object can be used as a prototype of another object, and the prototype itself can have its own prototype. If a prototype has a non-null reference to its prototype, and so on, it is called the &lt;em&gt;prototype chain&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Def. 3: Prototype chain:&lt;/strong&gt; A &lt;em&gt;prototype chain&lt;/em&gt; is a &lt;em&gt;finite&lt;/em&gt; chain of objects used to implement &lt;em&gt;inheritance&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;shared properties&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter figure&quot; src=&quot;http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/prototype-chain.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 2. A prototype chain.&quot; title=&quot;Figure 2. A prototype chain.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;Figure 2. A prototype chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule is very simple: if a property is not found in the object itself, there is an attempt to &lt;em&gt;resolve&lt;/em&gt; it in the prototype; in the prototype of the prototype, etc. — until the whole prototype chain is considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically this mechanism is known as &lt;em&gt;dynamic dispatch&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;delegation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Def. 4: Delegation:&lt;/strong&gt; a mechanism used to resolve a property in the inheritance chain. The process happens at runtime, hence is also called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;dynamic dispatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; in contrast with &lt;em&gt;static dispatch&lt;/em&gt; when references are resolved at &lt;em&gt;compile time&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;dynamic dispatch&lt;/em&gt; resolves the references at &lt;em&gt;runtime&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if a property eventually is not found in the prototype chain, the &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; value is returned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
// An &quot;empty&quot; object.
let empty = {};

console.log(

  // function, from default prototype
  empty.toString,
  
  // undefined
  empty.x

);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, a default object is actually &lt;em&gt;never empty&lt;/em&gt; — it always inherits &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; from the &lt;code&gt;Object.prototype&lt;/code&gt;. To create a &lt;em&gt;prototype-less dictionary&lt;/em&gt;, we have to explicitly set its prototype to &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
// Doesn't inherit from anything.
let dict = Object.create(null);

console.log(dict.toString); // null
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;dynamic dispatch&lt;/em&gt; mechanism allows &lt;em&gt;full mutability&lt;/em&gt; of the inheritance chain, providing an ability to change a delegation object:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
let foo = {x: 10};
let bar = {x: 20};

// Same as `let baz = {__proto__: foo};`:
let baz = Object.create(foo);
console.log(baz.x); // 10

// Change the delegate:
Object.setPrototypeOf(baz, bar);
console.log(baz.x); // 20
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; even though the &lt;code&gt;__proto__&lt;/code&gt; property is standardized today, and is easier to use for explanations, on practice prefer using API methods for prototype manipulations, such as &lt;code&gt;Object.create&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Object.getPrototypeOf&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;Object.setPrototypeOf&lt;/code&gt;, and similar on the &lt;code&gt;Reflect&lt;/code&gt; module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the example of &lt;code&gt;Object.prototype&lt;/code&gt;, we see that the &lt;em&gt;same prototype&lt;/em&gt; can be shared across &lt;em&gt;multiple objects&lt;/em&gt;. On this principle the &lt;em&gt;class-based inheritance&lt;/em&gt; is implemented in ECMAScript. Let’s see the example, and look under the hood of the “class” abstraction in JS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When several objects share the same initial state and behavior, they form a &lt;em&gt;classification&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Def. 5: Class:&lt;/strong&gt; A &lt;em&gt;class&lt;/em&gt; is a formal abstract set which specifies initial state and behavior of its objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case we need to have &lt;em&gt;multiple objects&lt;/em&gt; inheriting from the same prototype, we could of course create this one prototype, and explicitly inherit it from the newly created objects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
// Generic prototype for all letters.
let letter = {
  getNumber() {
    return this.number;
  }
};

let a = {number: 1, __proto__: letter};
let b = {number: 2, __proto__: letter};
// ...
let z = {number: 26, __proto__: letter};

console.log(
  a.getNumber(), // 1
  b.getNumber(), // 2
  z.getNumber(), // 26
);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see these relationships on the following figure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter figure&quot; src=&quot;http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/shared-prototype.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 3. A shared prototype.&quot; title=&quot;Figure 3. A shared prototype.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;Figure 3. A shared prototype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is obviously &lt;em&gt;cumbersome&lt;/em&gt;. And the class abstraction serves exactly this purpose — being a &lt;em&gt;syntactic sugar&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. a construct which &lt;em&gt;semantically does the same&lt;/em&gt;, but in a much &lt;em&gt;nicer syntactic form&lt;/em&gt;), it allows creating such multiple objects with the convenient pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
class Letter {
  constructor(number) {
    this.number = number;
  }

  getNumber() {
    return this.number;
  }
}

let a = new Letter(1);
let b = new Letter(2);
// ...
let z = new Letter(26);

console.log(
  a.getNumber(), // 1
  b.getNumber(), // 2
  z.getNumber(), // 26
);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;class-based inheritance&lt;/em&gt; in ECMAScript is implemented on top of the &lt;em&gt;prototype-based inheritance&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically a “class” is represented as a &lt;em&gt;“constructor function + prototype”&lt;/em&gt; pair. Thus, a constructor function creates objects, and also automatically sets the &lt;em&gt;prototype&lt;/em&gt; for its newly created instances. This prototype is stored in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ConstructorFunction&amp;gt;.prototype&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Def. 6: Constructor:&lt;/strong&gt; A &lt;em&gt;constructor&lt;/em&gt; is a function which is used to create instances, and automatically set their prototype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to use a constructor function explicitly. Moreover, before the class abstraction was introduced, JS developers used to do so not having a better way (we can still find a lot of such legacy code allover the internets):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
function Letter(number) {
  this.number = number;
}

Letter.prototype.getNumber = function() {
  return this.number;
};

let a = new Letter(1);
let b = new Letter(2);
// ...
let z = new Letter(26);

console.log(
  a.getNumber(), // 1
  b.getNumber(), // 2
  z.getNumber(), // 26
);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while creating a single-level constructor was pretty easy, the inheritance pattern from parent classes required much more boilerplate. Currently this boilerplate is hidden as an &lt;em&gt;implementation detail&lt;/em&gt;, and that exactly what happens under the hood when we create a class in JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;constructor functions&lt;/em&gt; are just &lt;em&gt;implementation details&lt;/em&gt; of the class-based inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see the relationships of the objects and their class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter figure&quot; src=&quot;http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/js-constructor.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 4. A constructor and objects relationship.&quot; title=&quot;Figure 4. A constructor and objects relationship.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;Figure 4. A constructor and objects relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure above shows that &lt;em&gt;every object&lt;/em&gt; has an associated prototype. Even the constructor function (class) &lt;code&gt;Letter&lt;/code&gt; has its own prototype, which is &lt;code&gt;Function.prototype&lt;/code&gt;. Notice, that &lt;code&gt;Letter.prototype&lt;/code&gt; is the prototype of the Letter &lt;em&gt;instances&lt;/em&gt;, that is &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when we understand the basic relationships between ECMAScript objects, let’s take a deeper look at JS &lt;em&gt;runtime system&lt;/em&gt;. As we will see, almost everything there can also be presented as an object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To execute JS code and track its runtime evaluation, ECMAScript spec defines the concept of an &lt;em&gt;execution context&lt;/em&gt;. Logically execution contexts are maintained using a &lt;em&gt;stack&lt;/em&gt; (the &lt;em&gt;execution context stack&lt;/em&gt; as we will see shortly), which corresponds to the generic concept of a &lt;em&gt;call-stack&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Def. 7: Execution context:&lt;/strong&gt; An &lt;em&gt;execution context&lt;/em&gt; is a specification device that is used to track the runtime evaluation of the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several types of ECMAScript code: the &lt;em&gt;global code&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;function code&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt; code&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;module code&lt;/em&gt;; each code is evaluated in its execution context. Different code types, and their appropriate objects may affect the structure of an execution context: for example, &lt;em&gt;generator functions&lt;/em&gt; save their &lt;em&gt;generator object&lt;/em&gt; on the context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s consider a recursive function call:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
function recursive(flag) {

  // Exit condition.
  if (flag === 2) {
    return;
  }

  // Call recursively.
  recursive(++flag);
}

// Go.
recursive(0);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a function is called, a &lt;em&gt;new execution context&lt;/em&gt; is created, and &lt;em&gt;pushed&lt;/em&gt; onto the stack — at this point it becomes &lt;em&gt;an active execution context&lt;/em&gt;. When a function returns, its context is &lt;em&gt;popped&lt;/em&gt; from the stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A context which calls another context is called a &lt;em&gt;caller&lt;/em&gt;. And a context which is being called, accordingly, is a &lt;em&gt;callee&lt;/em&gt;. In our example the &lt;code&gt;recursive&lt;/code&gt; function plays both roles: of a callee and a caller — when calls itself recursively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Def. 8: Execution context stack:&lt;/strong&gt; An &lt;em&gt;execution context stack&lt;/em&gt; is LIFO structure used to maintain control flow and order of execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our example from above we have the following stack &lt;em&gt;“push-pop”&lt;/em&gt; modifications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter figure&quot; src=&quot;http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/execution-stack.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 5. An execution context stack.&quot; title=&quot;Figure 5. An execution context stack.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;Figure 5. An execution context stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can also see, the &lt;em&gt;global context&lt;/em&gt; is always at the bottom of the stack, it is created prior execution of any other context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, a code of a context &lt;em&gt;runs to completion&lt;/em&gt;, however as we mentioned above, some objects — such as &lt;em&gt;generators&lt;/em&gt;, may violate LIFO order of the stack. A generator function may suspend its running context, and &lt;em&gt;remove&lt;/em&gt; it from the stack &lt;em&gt;before completion&lt;/em&gt;. Once a generator is activated again, its context is &lt;em&gt;resumed&lt;/em&gt; and again is &lt;em&gt;pushed&lt;/em&gt; onto the stack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
function *gen() {
  yield 1;
  return 2;
}

let g = gen();

console.log(
  g.next().value, // 1
  g.next().value, // 2
);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; statement here returns the value to the caller, and pops the context. On the second &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt; call, the &lt;em&gt;same context&lt;/em&gt; is pushed again onto the stack, and is &lt;em&gt;resumed&lt;/em&gt;. Such context may &lt;em&gt;outlive&lt;/em&gt; the caller which creates it, hence the violation of the LIFO structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; you can read more about generators and iterators in &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators&quot;&gt;this documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shall now discuss the important components of an execution context; in particular we should see how ECMAScript runtime manages &lt;em&gt;variables storage&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;scopes&lt;/em&gt; created by nested blocks of a code. This is the generic concept of &lt;em&gt;lexical environments&lt;/em&gt;, which is used in JS to store data, and solve &lt;em&gt;“Funarg problem”&lt;/em&gt; — with the mechanism of &lt;em&gt;closures&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every execution context has associated with it &lt;em&gt;lexical environment&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Def. 9: Lexical environment:&lt;/strong&gt; A &lt;em&gt;lexical environment&lt;/em&gt; is a structure used to define association between &lt;em&gt;identifiers&lt;/em&gt; appearing in the context with their values. Each environment can have a reference to an &lt;em&gt;optional parent environment&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically, an environment is a &lt;em&gt;pair&lt;/em&gt;, consisting of an &lt;em&gt;environment record&lt;/em&gt; (an actual table which maps identifiers to values), and a reference to the parent (which can be &lt;strong&gt;null&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
let x = 10;
let y = 20;

function foo(z) {
  let x = 100;
  return x + y + z;
}

foo(30); // 150
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The environment structures of the &lt;em&gt;global context&lt;/em&gt;, and a context of the &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; function would look as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter figure&quot; src=&quot;http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/environment-chain.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 6. An environment chain.&quot; title=&quot;Figure 6. An environment chain.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;Figure 6. An environment chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logically this reminds a &lt;em&gt;prototype chain&lt;/em&gt; which we’ve discussed above. And the rule for &lt;em&gt;identifiers resolution&lt;/em&gt; is very similar: if a variable is &lt;em&gt;not found&lt;/em&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; environment, there is an attempt to lookup it in the &lt;em&gt;parent environment&lt;/em&gt;, in the parent of the parent, and so on — until the whole &lt;em&gt;environment chain&lt;/em&gt; is considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Def. 10: Identifier resolution:&lt;/strong&gt; the process of resolving a variable &lt;em&gt;(binding)&lt;/em&gt; in an environment chain. An unresolved binding results to &lt;code&gt;ReferenceError&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This explains why variable &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is resolved to &lt;code&gt;100&lt;/code&gt; and not to &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;, why we can access parameter &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; — it’s also just stored on the &lt;em&gt;activation environment&lt;/em&gt;, and also why we can access the variable &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; — it is found in the parent environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly to prototypes, the same parent environment can be shared by several child environments: for example, two global functions share the same global environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; you can get detailed information about lexical environment in &lt;a href=&quot;http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/es5-chapter-3-2-lexical-environments-ecmascript-implementation/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environment records differ by &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt;. There are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;object&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; environment records and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;declarative&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; environment records. On top of the declarative record there are also &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;function&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; environment records, and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;module&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; environment records. Each type of the record has specific only to it properties. However, the generic mechanism of the identifier resolution is common across all the environments, and doesn’t depend on the type of a record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of an &lt;em&gt;object environment record&lt;/em&gt; can be the record of the &lt;em&gt;global environment&lt;/em&gt;. Such record has also associated &lt;em&gt;binding object&lt;/em&gt;, which may store some properties from the record, but not the others, and vice-versa. The binding object can also be provided as &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
// Legacy variables using `var`.
var x = 10;

// Modern variables using `let`.
let y = 20;

// Both are added to the environment record:
console.log(
  x, // 10
  y, // 20
);

// But only `x` is added to the &quot;binding object&quot;.
// The binding object of the global environment
// is the global object, and equals to `this`:

console.log(
  this.x, // 10
  this.y, // undefined!
);

// Binding object can store a name which is not
// added to the environment record, since it's
// not a valid identifier:

this['not valid ID'] = 30;

console.log(
  this['not valid ID'], // 30
);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is depicted on the following figure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter figure&quot; src=&quot;http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/env-binding-object.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 7. A binding object.&quot; title=&quot;Figure 7. A binding object.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;Figure 7. A binding object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice, the binding object exists to cover &lt;em&gt;legacy constructs&lt;/em&gt; such as &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt;-declarations, and &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt;-statements, which also provide their object as a binding object. These are historical reason when environments were represented as simple objects. Currently the environments model is much more optimized, however as a result we can’t access binding as properties anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already seen how environments are related via the parent link. Now we shall see how an environment can &lt;em&gt;outlive&lt;/em&gt; the context which creates it. This is the basis for the mechanism of &lt;em&gt;closures&lt;/em&gt; which we’re about to discuss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functions in ECMAScript are &lt;em&gt;first-class&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Def. 11: First-class function:&lt;/strong&gt; a function which can participate as a normal data: be stored in a variable, passed as an argument, or returned as a value from another function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the concept of first-class functions so called &lt;em&gt;“Funarg problem”&lt;/em&gt; is related (or &lt;em&gt;“A problem of a functional argument”&lt;/em&gt;), when a function has to deal with &lt;em&gt;free variables&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Def. 12: Free variable:&lt;/strong&gt; a variable which is &lt;em&gt;neither a parameter&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;nor a local variable&lt;/em&gt; of this function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at the Funarg problem, and see how it’s solved in ECMAScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following code snippet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
let x = 10;

function foo() {
  console.log(x);
}

function bar(funArg) {
  let x = 20;
  funArg(); // 10, not 20!
}

// Pass `foo` as an argument to `bar`.
bar(foo);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the function &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; the variable &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is free. When the &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; function is activated (via the &lt;code&gt;funArg&lt;/code&gt; parameter) — where should it resolve the &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; binding? From the &lt;em&gt;outer scope&lt;/em&gt; where the function was &lt;em&gt;created&lt;/em&gt;, or from the &lt;em&gt;caller scope&lt;/em&gt;, from where the function is &lt;em&gt;called&lt;/em&gt;? As we see, the caller, that is the &lt;code&gt;bar&lt;/code&gt; function, also provides the binding for &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; — with the value &lt;code&gt;20&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use-case described above is known as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;downward funarg problem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, i.e. an &lt;em&gt;ambiguity&lt;/em&gt; at determining a &lt;em&gt;correct environment&lt;/em&gt; of a binding: should it be an environment of the &lt;em&gt;creation time&lt;/em&gt;, or environment of the &lt;em&gt;call time&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is solved by an agreement of using &lt;em&gt;static scope&lt;/em&gt;, that is the scope of the &lt;em&gt;creation time&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Def. 13: Static scope:&lt;/strong&gt; a language implements &lt;em&gt;static scope&lt;/em&gt;, if only by looking at the source code one can determine in which environment a binding is resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The static scope sometimes is also called &lt;em&gt;lexical scope&lt;/em&gt;, hence the &lt;em&gt;lexical environments&lt;/em&gt; naming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically the static scope is implemented by &lt;em&gt;capturing the environment&lt;/em&gt; where a function is &lt;em&gt;created&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Note: you can read about &lt;em&gt;static&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;dynamic&lt;/em&gt; scopes in &lt;a href=&quot;https://codeburst.io/js-scope-static-dynamic-and-runtime-augmented-5abfee6223fe&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our example the &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; function’s captured environment is the &lt;em&gt;global environment&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter figure&quot; src=&quot;http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/closure.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 8. A closure.&quot; title=&quot;Figure 8. A closure.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;Figure 8. A closure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see that an environment references a function, which in turn reference the environment &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Def. 14: Closure:&lt;/strong&gt; A &lt;em&gt;closure&lt;/em&gt; is a function which &lt;em&gt;captures the environment&lt;/em&gt; where it’s &lt;em&gt;defined&lt;/em&gt;. Further this environment is used for &lt;em&gt;identifier resolution&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second sub-type of the Funarg problem is known as the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;upward funarg problem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The only difference here is that a capturing environment &lt;em&gt;outlives&lt;/em&gt; the context which creates it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see the example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
function foo() {
  let x = 10;
  
  // Closure, capturing environment of `foo`.
  function bar() {
    return x;
  }

  // Upward funarg.
  return bar;
}

let x = 20;

// Call to `foo` returns `bar` closure.
let bar = foo();

bar(); // 10, not 20!
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, technically it doesn’t differ from the same exact mechanism of capturing the definition environment. Just in this case, hadn’t we have the closure, the activation environment of &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;would be destroyed&lt;/em&gt;. But we &lt;em&gt;captured&lt;/em&gt; it, so it &lt;em&gt;cannot be deallocated&lt;/em&gt;, and is preserved — to support &lt;em&gt;static scope&lt;/em&gt; semantics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often there is an incomplete understanding of closures — usually developers think about closures only in terms of the upward funarg problem (and practically it really makes more sense). However, as we can see, technical mechanism for &lt;em&gt;downward&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;upward funarg problem&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;exactly the same&lt;/em&gt; — and is the &lt;em&gt;mechanism of static scope&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned above, similarly to prototypes, the same parent environment can be &lt;em&gt;shared&lt;/em&gt; across &lt;em&gt;several&lt;/em&gt; closures. This allows accessing and mutating the shared data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;

  return {
    increment() { count++; return count; },
    decrement() { count--; return count; },
  };
}

let counter = createCounter();

console.log(
  counter.increment(), // 1
  counter.decrement(), // 0
  counter.increment(), // 1
);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since both closures, &lt;code&gt;increment&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;decrement&lt;/code&gt;, are created within the scope containing the &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; variable, they &lt;em&gt;share&lt;/em&gt; this &lt;em&gt;parent scope&lt;/em&gt;. That is, capturing always happens &lt;em&gt;“by-reference”&lt;/em&gt; — meaning the &lt;em&gt;reference&lt;/em&gt; to the &lt;em&gt;whole parent environment&lt;/em&gt; is stored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see this on the following picture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter figure&quot; src=&quot;http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/shared-environment.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 9. A closure.&quot; title=&quot;Figure 9. A shared environment.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;Figure 9. A shared environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some languages may capture &lt;em&gt;by-value&lt;/em&gt;, making a copy of a captured variable, and do not allow changing it in the parent scopes. However in JS, to repeat, it is always the &lt;em&gt;reference&lt;/em&gt; to the parent scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; implementations may optimize this step, and do not capture the whole environment. Capturing &lt;em&gt;only used&lt;/em&gt; free-variables, they though still maintain invariant of mutable data in parent scopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So all identifiers are statically scoped. There is however &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; value which is &lt;em&gt;dynamically scoped&lt;/em&gt; in ECMAScript. It’s the value of &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; value is a special object which is &lt;em&gt;dynamically&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;implicitly&lt;/em&gt; passed to the code of a context. We can consider it as an &lt;em&gt;implicit extra parameter&lt;/em&gt;, which we can access, but cannot mutate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; value is to executed the same code for multiple objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Def. 15: This:&lt;/strong&gt; an implicit &lt;em&gt;context object&lt;/em&gt; accessible from a code of an execution context — in order to apply the same code for multiple objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major use-case is the class-based OOP. An instance method (which is defined on the prototype) exists in &lt;em&gt;one exemplar&lt;/em&gt;, but is &lt;em&gt;shared&lt;/em&gt; across &lt;em&gt;all the instances&lt;/em&gt; of this class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
class Point {
  constructor(x, y) {
    this._x = x;
    this._y = y;
  }

  getX() {
    return this._x;
  }

  getY() {
    return this._y;
  }
}

let p1 = new Point(1, 2);
let p2 = new Point(3, 4);

// Can access `getX`, and `getY` from
// both instances (they are passed as `this`).

console.log(
  p1.getX(), // 1
  p2.getX(), // 3
);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the &lt;code&gt;getX&lt;/code&gt; method is activated, a new environment is created to store local variables and parameters. In addition, &lt;em&gt;function environment record&lt;/em&gt; gets the &lt;code&gt;[[ThisValue]]&lt;/code&gt; passed, which is bound &lt;em&gt;dynamically&lt;/em&gt; depending how a function is &lt;em&gt;called&lt;/em&gt;. When it’s called with &lt;code&gt;p1&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; value is exactly &lt;code&gt;p1&lt;/code&gt;, and in the second case it’s &lt;code&gt;p2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to show the dynamic nature of &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; value, consider this example, which we leave to a reader as an exercise to solve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
function foo() {
  return this;
}

let bar = {
  foo,

  baz() {
    return this;
  },
};

// `foo`
console.log(
  foo(),       // global or undefined

  bar.foo(),   // bar
  (bar.foo)(), // bar

  (bar.foo = bar.foo)(), // global
);

// `bar.baz`
console.log(bar.baz()); // bar

let savedBaz = bar.baz;
console.log(savedBaz()); // global
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since only by looking at the source code of the &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; function we &lt;em&gt;cannot tell&lt;/em&gt; what value of &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; will it have &lt;em&gt;in a particular call&lt;/em&gt;, we say that &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; value is &lt;em&gt;dynamically scoped&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; you can get a detailed explanation how &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; value is determined, and why the code from above works the way it does, in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/chapter-3-this/&quot;&gt;appropriate chapter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;arrow functions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are special in terms of &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; value: their &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;em&gt;lexical (static)&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;not dynamic&lt;/em&gt;. I.e. their function environment record &lt;em&gt;does not provide &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; value&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s taken from the &lt;em&gt;parent environment&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
var x = 10;

let foo = {
  x: 20,

  // Dynamic `this`.
  bar() {
    return this.x;
  },

  // Lexical `this`.
  baz: () =&amp;gt; this.x,

  qux() {
    // Lexical this within the invocation.
    let arrow = () =&amp;gt; this.x;

    return arrow();
  },
};

console.log(
  foo.bar(), // 20, from `foo`
  foo.baz(), // 10, from global
  foo.qux(), // 20, from `foo` and arrow
);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like we said, in the &lt;em&gt;global context&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; value is the &lt;em&gt;global object&lt;/em&gt; (the &lt;em&gt;binding object&lt;/em&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;global environment record&lt;/em&gt;). Previously there was only one global object. In current version of the spec there might be &lt;em&gt;multiple global objects&lt;/em&gt; which are part of &lt;em&gt;code realms&lt;/em&gt;. Let’s discuss this structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before it is evaluated, all ECMAScript code must be associated with a &lt;em&gt;realm&lt;/em&gt;. Technically a realm just provides a global environment for a context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Def. 16: Realm:&lt;/strong&gt; A &lt;em&gt;code realm&lt;/em&gt; is an object which encapsulates a separate &lt;em&gt;global environment&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an &lt;em&gt;execution context&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;created&lt;/em&gt; it’s &lt;em&gt;associated&lt;/em&gt; with a particular &lt;em&gt;code realm&lt;/em&gt;, which provides the &lt;em&gt;global environment&lt;/em&gt; for this context. This association further &lt;em&gt;stays unchanged&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; a direct realm equivalent in browser environment is the &lt;code&gt;iframe&lt;/code&gt; element, which exactly provides a custom global environment. In Node.js it is close to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html&quot;&gt;vm module&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current version of the specification doesn’t provide an ability to explicitly create realms, but they can be created implicitly by the implementations. There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tc39/proposal-realms/&quot;&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt; though to expose this API to user-code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logically though, each context from the stack is always associated with its realm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter figure&quot; src=&quot;http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/context-realm.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 10. A context and realm association.&quot; title=&quot;Figure 10. A context and realm association.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;Figure 10. A context and realm association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we’re getting closer to the bigger picture of the ECMAScript runtime. Yet however we still need to see the &lt;em&gt;entry point&lt;/em&gt; to the code, and the &lt;em&gt;initialization process&lt;/em&gt;. This is managed by the mechanism of &lt;em&gt;jobs&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;job queues&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some operations can be postponed, and executed as soon as there is an available spot on the execution context stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Def. 17: Job:&lt;/strong&gt; A &lt;em&gt;job&lt;/em&gt; is an abstract operation that initiates an ECMAScript computation when &lt;em&gt;no other&lt;/em&gt; ECMAScript computation is currently in progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jobs are enqueued on the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;job queues&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and in current spec version there are two job queues: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ScriptJobs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;PromiseJobs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;em&gt;initial job&lt;/em&gt; on the &lt;em&gt;ScriptJobs&lt;/em&gt; queue is the &lt;em&gt;main entry point&lt;/em&gt; to our program — initial script which is loaded and evaluated: a realm is created, a global context is created and is associated with this realm, it’s pushed onto the stack, and the global code is executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice, the &lt;em&gt;ScriptJobs&lt;/em&gt; queue manages both, &lt;em&gt;scripts&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;modules&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further this context can execute &lt;em&gt;other contexts&lt;/em&gt;, or enqueue &lt;em&gt;other jobs&lt;/em&gt;. An example of a job which can be spawned and enqueued is a &lt;em&gt;promise&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When there is &lt;em&gt;no running&lt;/em&gt; execution context and the execution context stack is &lt;em&gt;empty&lt;/em&gt;, the ECMAScript implementation removes the first &lt;em&gt;pending job&lt;/em&gt; from a job queue, creates an execution context and starts its execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
// Enqueue a new promise on the PromiseJobs queue.
new Promise(resolve =&amp;gt; setTimeout(() =&amp;gt; resolve(10), 0))
  .then(value =&amp;gt; console.log(value));

// This log is executed earlier, since it's still a
// running context, and job cannot start executing first
console.log(20);

// Output: 20, 10
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; you can read more about promises in &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise&quot;&gt;this documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;async functions&lt;/em&gt; can &lt;em&gt;await&lt;/em&gt; for promises, so they also enqueue promise jobs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
async function later() {
  return await Promise.resolve(10);
}

(async () =&amp;gt; {
  let data = await later();
  console.log(data); // 10
})();
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; read more about async functions in &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we’re very close to the final picture of the current JS Universe. We shall see now &lt;em&gt;main owners&lt;/em&gt; of all those components we discussed, the &lt;em&gt;Agents&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;concurrency&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;parallelism&lt;/em&gt; is implemented in ECMAScript using &lt;em&gt;Agent pattern&lt;/em&gt;. The agent pattern is very close to the &lt;em&gt;Actor pattern&lt;/em&gt; — a lightweight process with message-passing style of communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Def. 18: Agent:&lt;/strong&gt; An &lt;em&gt;agent&lt;/em&gt; is an object encapsulating execution context stack, set of job queues, and code realms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementation dependent an agent can run on the same thread, or on a separate thread. A &lt;em&gt;worker agent&lt;/em&gt; in the browser environment is an example of the &lt;em&gt;Agent&lt;/em&gt; concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agents are &lt;em&gt;state isolated&lt;/em&gt; from each other, and can communicate by &lt;em&gt;sending messages&lt;/em&gt;. Some data can be shared though between agents, for example &lt;code&gt;SharedArrayBuffer&lt;/code&gt;s. Agents can also combine into &lt;em&gt;agent clusters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So below is the picture of the ECMAScript runtime:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter figure&quot; src=&quot;http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/agents-1.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 11. ECMAScript runtime.&quot; title=&quot;Figure 11. ECMAScript runtime.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;Figure 11. ECMAScript runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is it; that’s what happens under the hood of the ECMAScript engine!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we come to an end. This is the amount of information on JS core which we can cover within an overview article. Like we mentioned, JS code can be grouped into &lt;em&gt;modules&lt;/em&gt;, properties of objects can be tracked by &lt;code&gt;Proxy&lt;/code&gt; objects, etc, etc. — there are many user-level details which you can find in different documentations on JavaScript language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here though we tried to represent the &lt;em&gt;logical structure&lt;/em&gt; of an ECMAScript program itself, and hopefully it clarified these details. If you have any questions, suggestions or feedback, — as always I’ll be glad to discuss them in comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to thank the TC-39 representatives and spec editors which helped with clarifications for this article. The discussion can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DmitrySoshnikov/status/930507793047592960&quot;&gt;this Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck in studying ECMAScript!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Dell’s gamble on Linux laptops has paid off</title>
<link>http://www.techradar.com/news/why-dells-gamble-on-linux-laptops-has-paid-off</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.techradar.com/news/why-dells-gamble-on-linux-laptops-has-paid-off</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This article was provided to TechRadar by Linux Format, the number one magazine to boost your knowledge on Linux, open source developments, distro releases and much more. It appeared in issue 220, published February 2017. Subscribe to the print or digital version of Linux Format&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.myfavouritemagazines.co.uk/computer/linux-format-magazine-subscription/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole juggernaut that is now Linux on Dell started as the brainchild of two core individuals, Barton George (Senior Principal Engineer) and Jared Dominguez (OS Architect and Linux Engineer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was their vision that began it all back in 2012. It was long hours, uncertain futures and sheer belief that people really did want Linux laptops that sustained them. Here is the untold story of how Dell gained the top spot in preinstalled Linux on laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where do you start when no one has ever really even touched such a concept? The duo did have some experience of the area before. George explained that the XPS and M3800 Linux developer’s laptops weren’t Dell’s first foray into Linux laptops. Those with long memories may remember Dell testing the waters for a brief while by having a Linux offering alongside &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techradar.com/news/dell-laptop-deals&quot;&gt;Windows laptops&lt;/a&gt;. By their own admission it didn’t work out. “We misread the market,” commented George.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first attempt at Linux on laptops failed mainly because most non-technical users were blinded by the cheap price and didn’t understand what they were actually buying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dell found itself with purchasers who thought that they had scored an incredibly cheap laptop only to hit the inevitable question: “Where the heck has Windows gone?” which was generally followed by costly support issues and potential returns for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other unfortunate side effect was that by appealing to users with low-end hardware the experience was less than impressive even for those knowledgeable in Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully Dell decided to give Linux on laptops a second attempt thanks to George and Dominguez’s internal lobbying efforts. It isn’t a well-known fact but Dell has an internal skunkworks project where tiny projects can pitch ideas and get official Dell support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proving you can’t keep a good operating system down, George and Dominguez bid for funds in the Dell projects forum to produce a quality alternative to OS X and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/software/operating-systems/windows-10-1267364/review&quot;&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt;. It was a tense wait to see if they had done enough to get the blessing of the skunkworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the project scored a green light. However, the struggle was only just beginning as they had a comparatively miniscule budget of $40,000 (around £32,000, AU$52,000) and just six months to prove that not only could they build a compelling Linux on laptops offering but that Dell could turn it into a viable product and make money off of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning how not to create Linux laptops from the first time was helpful but there were some major differences with the new project. The first one being that they needed to nail their market and it was a crucial concern given their previous failure to find the right one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;bordeaux-image-check&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn0.static.techradar.futurecdn.net/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; lazy-image lazy-image-loading lazyload optional-image&quot; onerror=&quot;this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-normal=&quot;http://cdn0.static.techradar.futurecdn.net/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dzBrvhUM76zE3r4D3PyuT3-320-80.jpg&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dzBrvhUM76zE3r4D3PyuT3-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dzBrvhUM76zE3r4D3PyuT3-650-80.jpg 650w&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-original-mos=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dzBrvhUM76zE3r4D3PyuT3.jpg&quot; data-pin-media=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dzBrvhUM76zE3r4D3PyuT3.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;know-your-market&quot;&gt;Know your market&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make sure they had the right ideas and concepts they jumped on a plane bound for the West Coast and landed in California to speak to several “very large web shops” that the pair declined to name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What made the trip that bit more awkward for them was the fact that the Dell duo could only show some prototypes of a laptop that they “may sorta perhaps” have coming to market. No guarantees, no promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Universally the reception was ‘Get back to us when you have the real product but we sure are interested.’ This was positive news because the pair knew that these were the type of companies that could purchase many units and make the project financially viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time the duo had the right initial market. It was big, commercial web-scale operators and their developers who were crying out for a fully supported Linux laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back from their successful trip, the duo realised that the project would never see the light of day without big support from someone with gravitas championing its cause. Fortunately, they didn’t have to look far. In this instance, they had Michael Dell’s executive assistant as their champion – aside from Mr Dell himself they were unlikely to top that, so the team felt confident their backs were covered, but now needed to deliver on their promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They can provide the air cover but you need to work hard on the ground,” was George’s take on the situation and when it came to the hardware they had to make sure it was a good offering and more importantly worked well with Linux. Cost was almost secondary to making sure the product worked and was popular with their big clients they’d met previously who had loved the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first offerings needed to be both priced attractively and be fairly configurable given that they had to appeal to a range of users. The XPS was seen as the obvious choice given its quality, expandability and popularity. The first XPS Linux offering (Gen1 circa 2012) was a single configuration built and offered up to the world. It couldn’t be found on Dell’s website, though. The initial notice of availability was given via George’s personal website. He also noted that it was most definitely a beta product and had all the baggage that the tag brought with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George recalled how in a typical week his blog would average 1,500 hits a day. When the XPS development station was mentioned views skyrocketed to a peak over several weeks of 9,000 views a day. Not epic, but a good start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requests for beta testers (who had to commit to purchasing their own units – this was no freebie) rolled in left, right and centre, eventually totalling over 6,000 requests to be included in the program, which quickly proved that the idea of Linux on Dell laptops had a viable and, importantly, profitable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internally, word got around about this cool new project that was going on. In typical geek fashion people started to donate time and resources for free (well, on Dell’s dime technically but no one was counting). A few lucky individuals, including Dominguez, were permanently borrowed for third line Linux server support, never to return as bigger endeavours beckoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;bordeaux-image-check&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn0.static.techradar.futurecdn.net/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; lazy-image lazy-image-loading lazyload optional-image&quot; onerror=&quot;this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-normal=&quot;http://cdn0.static.techradar.futurecdn.net/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VnKNfTueRGLAxttk6uc5b3-320-80.jpg&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VnKNfTueRGLAxttk6uc5b3-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VnKNfTueRGLAxttk6uc5b3-650-80.jpg 650w&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-original-mos=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VnKNfTueRGLAxttk6uc5b3.jpg&quot; data-pin-media=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VnKNfTueRGLAxttk6uc5b3.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techradar.com/news/software/operating-systems/best-linux-distros-for-power-users-1153562&quot;&gt;Power users&lt;/a&gt; and developers know that RAM is king when trying to develop and perform debugging. While the Gen 1 XPS was all good, the screen was a bit small for some and the amount of RAM that could be installed was a little limiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Dominguez’s first off-the-hip moves was to get a larger, more powerful Developers Edition laptop for those they had courted earlier that same year. An M3800 notebook got the Linux makeover for those developers that wanted performance over size. Fortunately, both machines shared the same peripherals, trackpads etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as things seemed to be coming together the project narrowly avoided a near-fatal cancellation. No one saw it coming but in late 2012 Dell was looking to save money as times were proving hard after the global recession of 2008. Everyone and every project was fair game to be scaled down or closed to help the bottom line. The Linux on laptops project, just weeks from release, was a plump and juicy target for some and George and Dominguez weren’t even sure if the project would ever see the commercial light of day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They carried on anyway, half expecting to be told to stop, the dream is over. Sleepless nights plagued the project. Luckily, the team dodged the cost-cutting bullet but as Dominguez reflected on the feeling at the time: “If anything it was a call to get this puppy out the door as quickly as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Dell’s point of view it was a high-risk, high-reward scenario: a market with no other big players and ripe for the taking. There still had to be accountability in terms of costs and deliverables, however: “Our original idea of having several configurations per device wasn’t feasible so we narrowed it down to just one device with one configuration to streamline our focus,” explained George. “Slowly but surely we’ve been able to build out our portfolio and are now pleased to offer four different Precision models.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This meant a slowly but surely approach with limited but well-configured systems available, as multiple configurations cost development time, money and resources.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why Education Startups Do Not Succeed (2011)</title>
<link>https://avichal.com/2011/10/07/why-education-startups-do-not-succeed/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://avichal.com/2011/10/07/why-education-startups-do-not-succeed/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt; I co-founded PrepMe in 2001. We were one of the first education companies online and the first purely online, personalized platform. We were acquired in 2011 by Providence Equity-backed Ascend Learning. &lt;/em&gt;In the last month, I’ve had 3 VC firms bring me in to chat with their partnership about education and 6 independent entrepreneurs reach out to me about their new education startup. This is a summary of what I tell them in person. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I am going to make some generalizations below. Clearly there are nuances around education policy, economic policy, technology, and more. But this is a blog post, not a book, so take it for what it’s worth. These views are my own, not PrepMe’s (or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.getspool.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Spool’s&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most entrepreneurs in education build the wrong type of business, because entrepreneurs think of education as a quality problem. The average person thinks of it as a cost problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building in education does not follow an Internet company’s growth curve. Do it because you want to fix problems in education for the next 20 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are opportunities in education in servicing the poor in the US and building a company in Asia — not in selling to the middle class in the US.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The underlying culture will change and expose interesting opportunities in the long term, but probably not for another 5 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Education is ripe for disruption. Technology and great products could make education so much better. If a product like Blackboard or University of Phoenix can succeed, then imagine how great a company you could build if built educational products like Apple does for consumer electronics!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s qualify what they’re saying here. Almost always what they are really saying is “consumer, Internet, online education in the Western world is ready for disruption. Everyone is online now and everyone gets an education, so clearly there are massive businesses to be built.” They probably aren’t talking about education in Asia because the companies in that space are started on the ground in Asia. They most likely aren’t selling to schools, districts, the government, or universities. VCs usually don’t like to invest in businesses that sell to the government until those businesses are big (at which point it’s really a private equity deal, not a venture capital deal). Angels will invest in education companies because they’re more motivated by making a difference, not by making a big return in 5 years. For now, let’s focus on US and European online education targeted at consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The average person in a developed country does not think about education the way a well educated VC or entrepreneur thinks about education.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VCs and entrepreneurs tend to be well educated. &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well educated people think about education as an investment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You put as many of your resources in to an investment as you can. It may take 20 years to pay off, but if the return-on-investment is high (which it is for education) then you invest. This group of people — if you’re reading this, you fall into this group — generally understand that education is an investment, and as a result are price insensitive and will optimize for quality (a higher return on investment). &lt;strong&gt;For this group of people, quality is the primary driver of a purchasing decision, not cost.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;The average, middle class person thinks about education as an expenditure, not an investment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; It’s something they have to do because it’s mandated and the lack of the highest quality education hasn’t negatively impacted their lives in a meaningful way. Step back for a second before you judge. Imagine it’s 2005, and you live in a small town in the middle of Ohio (where I grew up) and you don’t get a college degree. If you get a factory job and make $25k/year and your wife gets a factory job and makes $25k/year, you’re making $50k/year. But houses only cost $90,000 and food is affordable and you can get a loan for a car for $300/month. So you’re not doing terribly and the default state for your children is the same life. You can afford a house, food, have a car, and have weekends off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what has the lack of an education done to the typical American’s life? It’s removed job security, screwed your retirement, and maybe set you up to go bankrupt if you get sick. &lt;strong&gt;There are no immediate consequences, there are no immediate consequences for your children, but there is an immediate cost. So the average person thinks of education as an expenditure. &lt;/strong&gt;If you get sick when you’re 70, you’re screwed. Or if you don’t save in your 401k, you may have to work till you’re dead. Or maybe your children won’t be as competitive in a global workforce 30 years. Don’t believe me? Only 15% of kids taking the SAT pay for an out of school test prep course like Kaplan. Over 50% of Americans don’t have beyond a high school degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fundamental investment vs. expenditure mindset changes everything. &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You think of education as fundamentally a quality problem. The average person thinks of education as fundamentally a cost problem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Educational companies that focus on delivering higher quality solutions to consumers will not scale to the mainstream. Educational companies built around driving down costs to the end consumer will scale. &lt;/strong&gt;Or a corollary, &lt;strong&gt;an enterprise sales or government sales company that taps into government revenue streams will scale but will not have a consumer Internet growth curve.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at some data from the marketplace:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chegg&lt;/em&gt; – A company that is in education and sells to consumers. A $1 billion valuation and growing quickly. But, Chegg sells you the same textbook experience for much cheaper. It’s a great consumer focused business with offering real savings to students. Note that even in 2011, the “Netflix of education” is booming because of the equivalent of its DVD (physical textbook) business. Digital, personalized learning online or tablet based, interactive, social textbooks aren’t anywhere to be found.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;University of Phoenix&lt;/em&gt; – $6 billion market cap. They make it easier to get a degree because it’s convenient and subsidized by government backed loans. Consumers make the decision but ultimately the government is footing the bill. They aren’t a consumer company and they are a marketing machine. They are a company that makes it easy to get the same quality diploma that you would get at the local college. They don’t compete with Harvard, they compete with the local university that costs more and only has on campus night courses. They weren’t an overnight success either; UofP was started in 1976 and they IPO-ed in 1994.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kaplan&lt;/em&gt; – they didn’t get huge because of their test prep business, which is a consumer business and (arguably) delivers educational value. They became huge because they started following the University of Phoenix model for Kaplan University. Again, the primary value they offer is not quality of education, but convenience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;K12&lt;/em&gt; – they are not a consumer, online education company. They sell to school districts and their model revolves around being able to drive down costs for school districts in their high cost students — special needs, gifted, rural, etc. They have built an interesting consumer business overseas — in the Middle East and Asia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;Here are a few examples of companies that tried to do consumer Internet style education plays and how it worked for them:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;TutorVista&lt;/em&gt; – started by offering online tutoring to Western students using tutors in India. All you can eat for $99/month or so. They burned millions on search engine marketing and were able to build a business that generated eight figure revenue — nice but not enough to IPO on. So they pivoted and opened education centers in India and were acquired for $213 million by Pearson. A $200+ million acquisition in India is unheard of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tutor.com&lt;/em&gt; – started a decade ago to offer online tutoring to the masses. Never went mainstream, even after 5 rounds of funding. They’ve built a niche business that survives through deals they’ve struck with various government bodies — libraries, schools, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;GlobalScholar&lt;/em&gt; – started by the CEO of Drugstore.com, tried initially to do a direct to consumer play. Realized it wasn’t working and bought an electronic gradebook company that works with schools and was sold to Scantron that has great distribution with schools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;There are dozens of examples of companies that have tried to build around quality and hit a revenue ceiling in the few millions. Think about the 10 local tutoring centers in your city that probably make $1 million each. This early traction is very misleading because you see engaged, happy, paying customers. So you assume that it will scale but it turns out that this business won’t scale because &lt;strong&gt;your early adopters behave fundamentally differently than the mass market&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, this section is a little hand wavy and full of generalizations. These are observational insights with some data points that show the generalizations are directionally accurate at the end. This is not a rigorous sociological study, so take the generalizations for what they’re worth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re living in most of Asia (South Asia included) and you don’t get an education, you’re screwed. Part of this is cultural (you have no social capital if you’re not well educated) and a lot of it is economic (if you don’t have an education, you will do menial labor and not have enough money to feed your children). Consider the difference between some random person in China vs. some random person in Kansas. If the Chinese person doesn’t get an education there’s a good chance they will not get a job. They will die poor, unable to adequately feed their children, and unable to take care of their parents (since the model is that the young take care of the older members of the family). But if they do get an education, they have a shot at a good life — call centers, banks, government jobs, the army, etc. And if it’s too late for that individual, they know that they can give a good life to their children. The non-college educated person in Kansas probably won’t have a great life and a secure retirement without an education. But they, their children, and their parents probably won’t die hungry and homeless on the streets of Topeka. This cultural mentality is carried over to many Asian Americans via immigration. This is not universally true, of course, of Asian Americans but there is no denying there is a strong correlation. So if you want to start a consumer education company in Asia, you can make it work and make it scale — MegaStudy and Kumon are two great examples. However, there are not enough Asian Americans to support the same scale of business in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being poor also changes how you think about education. Interestingly, in the US, the people who are most willing to try new things are the poor and uneducated because they have a similar incentive structure to a person in rural India. Their default state is “screwed.” If a poor person doesn’t do something dramatic, they are going to stay screwed. Many parents and teachers in these communities understand this. So the communities are often willing to try new, experimental things — online education, charter schools, longer school days, no summer vacation, co-op programs — even if they may not work. Why? Because their students’ default state is “screwed” and they need something dramatically better. Doing something significantly higher quality is the only way to overcome the inertia of already being screwed. The affordable, but poor quality approaches just aren’t good enough. These communities are on the hunt for dramatically better approaches and willing to try new things. Unfortunately the poor don’t have a lot of money to spend so servicing this community requires selling to the schools, which is an enterprise sales type of business — not a consumer business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider Kumon, which is worth almost $1 Billion. They started in Asia, they are essentially a franchise model that caters to well educated parents, and a key part of the value proposition is in giving students a place to go and be supervised (babysitting!). It’s a great business that serves 4.2 million students worldwide. Of this, about 200,000 are in the US. The overwhelming majority are in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not a perfect dataset but the Quantcast data for Khan Academy’s US demographics support this. The people going to the site are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the already well educated who value education and want supplemental resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poorer (which unfortunately correlates with being African American and Hispanic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://avichal.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/screen-shot-2011-09-24-at-11-08-55-am.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Khan Academy Demographics&quot; src=&quot;https://avichal.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/screen-shot-2011-09-24-at-11-08-55-am.png?w=632&amp;amp;h=246&quot; alt=&quot;Khan Academy Demographics&quot; width=&quot;632&quot; height=&quot;246&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly education is billions (trillions!) of dollars. There are lots of opportunities, especially if you take a long term view of it and want to build something meaningful for the next 25 years. However, don’t make the following mistakes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t believe that building a better product will make you successful. Delivering something for cheaper will. Even if that cheaper thing is lower quality. This is usually repugnant to most well-educated entrepreneurs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t start in developed, western countries because that’s where large, Internet businesses have been built. Asia is a much better education market if you want to target consumers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t take VC funding because the growth curve in your education business will not live up to VC expectations early on. Take angel money from people who want to make a difference in education. Then take private equity money once you’ve figured out how to get to $10 million in revenue on your own. Even better, don’t take any PE money and grow it on cash flows. Successful education businesses are often not capital constrained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t target suburban or urban, middle class users with disposable income. You’ll build a niche business that can’t go mainstream. Target poor students in the US and get to charter schools who are desperate to try new things. Target families in China and India where a family will put down half of their monthly income on education. Or target people who really value education and will pay 10x more for something that is higher quality. That’s where there are big businesses to be built and a willingness for new solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t expect a quick flip or quick growth. Building a large, successful education company will take 20 years. The growth curve will not be like an Internet technology company until you hit $10+ million in revenue. Then things will ramp  quickly because you will have identified your core market and built the beginnings of a brand; the education industry is small and people will know if you deliver real value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

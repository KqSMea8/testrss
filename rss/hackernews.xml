<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Whether the&lt;/em&gt; Andrea Gail &lt;em&gt;rolls, pitch-poles, or gets driven down, she winds up, one way or another, in a position from which she cannot recover. Among marine architects this is known as the zero-moment point – the point of no return.” –Sebastian Junger, “The Perfect Storm”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posts like this aren’t my usual fare, but there’s a lot of readers on Tumblr. So y’all might be interested – or, if not, you really should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, this went down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/69efc44a7c64942ac4f3e59a9b5125e5/tumblr_inline_p45yenyl6H1r4pnzr_500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;750&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;377&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;251&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/a9320c02c2b3669f9ee2bbc5ac55fcfd/tumblr_inline_p45yf8HOYv1r4pnzr_500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;750&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;909&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;606&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the bloodless, matter-of-fact, ho-hum business event way of describing it. Let me paint you a different picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday morning, every single Barnes &amp;amp; Noble location – that’s 781 stores – told their full-time employees to pack up and leave. The eliminated positions were as follows: the head cashiers (those are the people responsible for handling the money), the receiving managers (the people responsible for bringing in product and making sure it goes where it should), the digital leads (the people responsible for solving Nook problems), the newsstand leads (the people responsible for distributing the magazines), and the bargain leads (the people responsible for keeping up the massive discount sections). A few of the larger stores were able to spare their head cashiers and their receiving managers, but not many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just about everyone lost between 3 and 7 employees. The unofficial numbers put the total around 1,800 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/4388660b2be11a33b84ce8d15c06647f/tumblr_inline_p45ygqWgDB1r4pnzr_500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;750&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;758&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;505&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/a3220b8a2ea1d0792704ad75b696f7e0/tumblr_inline_p45ygx4rFb1r4pnzr_500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;750&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;947&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;631&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re not talking post-holiday culling of seasonal workers. This was the Red Wedding. &lt;em&gt;Every person laid off was a full-time employee&lt;/em&gt;. These were people for whom Barnes &amp;amp; Noble was a career. Most of them had given 5, 10, 20 years to the company. In most cases it was their sole source of income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it gets worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who lost their jobs had been &lt;em&gt;actively assured this would NOT happen&lt;/em&gt; for the past several months. Home Office decided last year that these positions – head cashiers, receiving managers, leads – were due to be eliminated… &lt;em&gt;but no layoffs were to take place.&lt;/em&gt; All current employees were to be grandfathered in. The positions wouldn’t go away until the people currently holding them &lt;em&gt;chose to leave&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For months they told everyone this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then on Monday, each person was called into the manager’s office. Fifteen minutes later, each person gathered up their things and left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/735fc18459b9f991c485cf9d601b0bfa/tumblr_inline_p45z9mQmqJ1r4pnzr_500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;750&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;623&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;415&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Severance packages varied; usually as little as two weeks pay. Demotions were not offered. Those laid off – and I’d like to reiterate that these were &lt;em&gt;career employees&lt;/em&gt; – were offered the opportunity to reapply for part-time positions. At base pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thanks for your 17 years of service. If you’d like to come back in two months to work registers for minimum wage, we’d love to have you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Don’t let the glamor of book sales fool you. B&amp;amp;N entry pay is minimum wage.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now. You’re going to hear a lot about the dropped sales. You’re going to hear a lot about Amazon. You’re going to hear about how there was no way around this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, dear friends, is bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/c9041ac330ad66a32d964cc1242a1303/tumblr_inline_p45ytxN7TD1r4pnzr_500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;750&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;937&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;624&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/b0146c2329ffa58226aedfd371739b79/tumblr_inline_p45yu4AfVt1r4pnzr_500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;750&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;807&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;538&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to talk to you about why sales dropped during the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A company wants cash on hand to look good to stockholders. The quickest way for a company to get cash on hand is to cut back on payroll. Which Barnes &amp;amp; Noble did this holiday season. During December, staffing at most locations was no different than it would be on your average day in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something kinda important is happening in December, btw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/a9cbfbdd6c99cd8ad53373deb7d8f484/tumblr_inline_p45yus9Ffu1r4pnzr_500.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;600&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;400&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, hours in receiving were carved to the bone. You know what that means? It means that product – product that could be selling – sat unopened in boxes. In many cases, those boxes had already been logged into the system. The computers showed we had them. Customers came in, expecting to purchase things, knowing they were in the store! But what they wanted was buried under 100, 200 boxes. And there were no employees to find them. There were barely any employees available at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers went away annoyed. And they shopped on Amazon instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because, well, why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As a side note: people often want to know why Amazon’s prices are so much lower than B&amp;amp;N’s, and why B&amp;amp;N doesn’t price match. There’s a lot of different reasons, but the biggest is that Amazon loss-leads their books: that is, sells them at a loss, then makes up the money with expensive add-ons, like Echos or Kindles or other non-book stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/63ead700e2478c71ef7944751c364156/tumblr_inline_p45yvjuDM71r4pnzr_500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;750&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;632&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;421&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barnes &amp;amp; Noble only has books; they can’t make up the discount loss by selling water coolers. Amazon undercuts prices, and once they’re the only players in the market, that will stop. Just so you know.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, sales sucked. Cutting hours during the busiest season of the year punched quarter earnings in the gut. Big shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you were trying to solve the problem – if you were trying to revitalize this business – what would you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Oh, I know! I would tighten my belt at the executive level, then I would double-down on what we can offer that Amazon can’t: enthusiastic staff that can find and upsell books to suit each customer, and the largest in-store selection possible so that everyone who comes in can walk away with what they want. If I absolutely had no choice but to reduce payroll, I would eliminate some part-time positions, and count on the knowledge and experience of our veterans to get us through the lean times.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/0ae8734d4f4184e8ac3d9f6032d0047f/tumblr_inline_p45yx4jqx31r4pnzr_250.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;244&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;244&quot; width=&quot;244&quot; height=&quot;244&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are definitely the choices you would make if you wanted to rebuild a company to last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s a secret:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Barnes &amp;amp; Noble executives do not intend to rebuild.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I know this? Because every decision from the upper levels is being made solely to increase cash on hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s been so many things – so many things – but me tell you about the canary in the coal mine. Let me tell you how I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; saving Barnes &amp;amp; Noble is not in the home office’s plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last summer, the decision was made to switch to “ship from store”. Previously, when a customer ordered a book online, the book would be shipped to them from one of our warehouses. The new policy, however, had stores taking books off their shelves, packaging them up, and sending them out each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was to “decrease shipping time by sending books from the closest location to the customer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Spoiler alert: that wasn’t true.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So each store takes employees off the selling floor – where they could, you know, help customers – and sets them to fill orders. The stores remove books from their own shelves and mail them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stores do not get credit for those sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me repeat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The stores do not get credit for those sales&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;company&lt;/em&gt; makes money. The brick and mortar store – which &lt;em&gt;Barnes &amp;amp; Noble is based on&lt;/em&gt; – loses the opportunity to sell that book (pissing off customers), and gets nothing in return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which hurts the bottom line of that store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Uh-oh, your sales dropped. Better cut back hours.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a decision that is only made if the executive level of a company is no longer interested in helping their business. This is a decision that is made only if the executive level has decided the company is dying, and don’t care if they hasten along the demise as long as they can harvest the organs for themselves and leave everyone else with the shriveled husk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of organ harvesters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/1e08532124f05ead823b6b2bb9cf8e8f/tumblr_inline_p45z3wqudp1r4pnzr_500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;750&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;787&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;524&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the way, it should be noted that the last CEO, who worked for Barnes &amp;amp; Noble for less than a year, received a $4,500,000 payout. The CEO before him, who &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; worked at Barnes &amp;amp; Noble for less than a year, received a $10,000,000 payout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/458c1ffd869e0dc9562285a1c750bbee/tumblr_inline_p45z4yop6c1r4pnzr_1280.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;750&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;1263&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;842&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company saved $40m by firing 1,800 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After paying out $14,500,000 to two executives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us back around to Monday’s layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By getting rid of their most expensive (ie, most experienced) workers, B&amp;amp;N was able to replace said workers with part-time, benefit-less, minimum-wage employees. This is not to knock newbies – we were all ones once! – but a new hire can’t do what a 15 year veteran can. They just can’t. Not right away. Not for a long time. And not in the specialized departments that were laid off: head cashiering, receiving, digital, newsstand, bargain. Those are &lt;em&gt;hard jobs&lt;/em&gt; that take training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who’s going to train?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And who’s going to want to be trained for something that hard, when there’s no possibility of a promotion down the line? When you’re only working minimum wage for a maximum of 25 hours a week?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of this post, I quoted Junger and the zero-moment point. The loss of these veterans, and the positions they worked, cannot be recovered from. Barnes &amp;amp; Noble is going under.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/3c322c1f6f587dd6a498eaff8e5e7b4c/tumblr_inline_p45z6hed2v1r4pnzr_500.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;499&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;262&quot; width=&quot;499&quot; height=&quot;262&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“That sucks, but it’s the way capitalism works. Hate the game, not the player.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure. Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday morning, as thousands of lives were upended, Barnes &amp;amp; Noble – literally in the same hour – released this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/54b5a1b256346dc592dfc4fdab51d258/tumblr_inline_p45z7tZozT1r4pnzr_1280.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;750&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;1242&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;828&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/96133dad90e34e4be846e0ecb2c4850a/tumblr_inline_p45z82F81J1r4pnzr_500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;740&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;342&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;231&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His deep knowledge of retail and proven track record are exactly what we need to invigorate our merchandising strategy and grow our business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grow our business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/32e672c4eddc1a3d9ab7b6733f6979e8/tumblr_inline_p45zabPzkm1r4pnzr_500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;750&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;694&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;462&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what happens after Barnes &amp;amp; Noble sinks. It’s all well and good to say “Support indie stores!” but there are huge swaths of America where there &lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt; any. B&amp;amp;N is the last thing standing between Amazon and a total monopoly of the publishing industry, and a monopoly is never a good thing. But the entire book world needs to be prepared, because it’s coming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zero-moment point came Monday, and in the crassest, cruelest, more heartless way possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnes &amp;amp; Noble has slit its own wrists. Now we just wait to bleed out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>FCC’s Inspector General investigating whether Ajit Pai acted inappropriately</title>
<link>https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mb53jn/fcc-inspector-general-investigation-ajit-pai-corruption</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mb53jn/fcc-inspector-general-investigation-ajit-pai-corruption</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;FCC boss Ajit Pai is being investigated by his own agency over potential corruption allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The already-unpopular agency boss has been on a tear in recent months &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/paadj8/the-fcc-is-using-an-obsolete-loophole-to-help-a-pro-trump-media-company-take-over-local-tv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gutting decades old media-consolidation rules&lt;/a&gt; designed to protect consumers and the nation’s media markets from any one broadcaster becoming too powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pai’s efforts arrived, not coincidentally, at the same time Sinclair Broadcasting Group is attempting to acquire Tribune Media as part of a $3.9 billion dollar megamerger. It’s a deal a &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wjjkxm/liberals-and-conservatives-attack-tv-merger-that-would-let-pro-trump-media-dominate-local-news&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bipartisan chorus of critics&lt;/a&gt; say would demolish media diversity, resulting in Sinclair owning more than 230 local stations across 72 percent of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given criticism of Sinclair for its often &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/sinclair-requires-tv-stations-including-komo-to-air-segments-that-tilt-to-the-right/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;distorted and inaccurate&lt;/a&gt; news reporting, consumer advocates say the deal would have a profoundly negative impact on the quality and diversity of media discourse, as well as already dwindling competition in the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without Pai’s assistance on this front, the Sinclair merger would have been impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; indicates that the FCC’s Inspector General has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/technology/fcc-sinclair-ajit-pai.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;launched an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into whether Pai acted inappropriately as he rushed to dismantle media consolidation rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late last year, &quot;the top internal watchdog for the F.C.C. opened an investigation into whether Mr. Pai and his aides had improperly pushed for the rule changes and whether they had timed them to benefit Sinclair,&quot; the report states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was unclear the extent of the inspector general’s investigation or when it might conclude, but the inquiry puts a spotlight on Mr. Pai’s decisions and whether there had been coordination with the company,&quot; said the Times. &quot;It may also force him to answer questions that he has so far avoided addressing in public.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy and Commerce Ranking Member Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ), who has been calling for an inquiry for much of last year, was quick to applaud the revelations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For months I have been trying to get to the bottom of the allegations about Chairman Pai’s relationship with Sinclair Broadcasting,” Pallone &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FrankPallone/status/964155021687435264&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am particularly concerned about reports that Chairman Pai may have coordinated with Sinclair to time a series of Commission actions to benefit the company,” Pallone added. “I am grateful to the FCC’s Inspector General that he has decided to take up this important investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer groups were similarly-quick to pounce on the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Until the inspector general’s investigation is complete, Chairman Pai and any other FCC staff subject to this inquiry should recuse themselves from all dealings related to Sinclair’s proposed takeover of Tribune Media,&quot; Free Press Senior Counsel Jessica J. González said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If the investigation finds that Pai or any other FCC staff did indeed let their own bias and favoritism shape decisions related to the deal, they must not be permitted to vote on this matter and they should be subject to other appropriate ethics-review processes,” González added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inquiry joins a rotating crop of other investigations into Pai’s behavior during his first controversial year as agency head. A GAO inquiry is &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/10/fccs-ddos-claims-will-be-investigated-by-government/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;also looking into&lt;/a&gt; why Pai’s FCC appears to have made up a DDOS attack in order to try and downplay massive public opposition to the agency’s repeal of popular net neutrality rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pai’s agency is also facing numerous lawsuits over allegations that Pai ignored the public as he rushed to repeal those rules. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman penned an open letter to Pai last year effectively accusing him of &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@AGSchneiderman/an-open-letter-to-the-fcc-b867a763850a&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blocking a law enforcement inquiry&lt;/a&gt; into the numerous bogus comments that flooded the agency in support of its unpopular repeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pai has frequently &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/washington/pai-serves-zingers-dc-dinner/170519&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;made light&lt;/a&gt; of concerns he’s too cozy with the giant corporations he’s supposed to be holding accountable. And while these investigations and lawsuits may or may not culminate in evidence of corruption or violation of agency rules, Pai’s policies alone leave few questions about where his loyalties lie.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Rust 1.24</title>
<link>https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/02/15/Rust-1.24.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/02/15/Rust-1.24.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Rust team is happy to announce a new version of Rust, 1.24.0. Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, getting Rust 1.24.0 is as easy as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;rustup update stable
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have it already, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html&quot;&gt;get &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustup&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the appropriate page on our website, and check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-1240-2018-02-15&quot;&gt;detailed release notes for 1.24.0&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-in-1240-stable&quot;&gt;What’s in 1.24.0 stable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release contains two very exciting new features: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustfmt&lt;/code&gt; and incremental compilation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;rustfmt&quot;&gt;rustfmt&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years now, we’ve wanted a tool that automatically can reformat your Rust code to some sort of “standard style.” With this release, we’re happy to announce that a &lt;em&gt;preview&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustfmt&lt;/code&gt; can be used with 1.24 stable. To give it a try, do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;rustup component add rustfmt-preview
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two important aspects here: first, you’re using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustup component add&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cargo install&lt;/code&gt; here. If you’ve previously used &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustfmt&lt;/code&gt; via &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cargo install&lt;/code&gt;, you should uninstall it first. Second, this is a preview, as it says in the name. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustfmt&lt;/code&gt; is not at 1.0 yet, and some stuff is being tweaked, and bugs are being fixed. Once &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustfmt&lt;/code&gt; hits 1.0, we’ll be releasing a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustfmt&lt;/code&gt; component and deprecating &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustfmt-preview&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the near future, we plan on writing a post about this release strategy, as it’s big enough for its own post, and is broader than just this release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more, please check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustfmt&lt;/code&gt; on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;incremental-compilation&quot;&gt;Incremental compilation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in September of 2016 (!!!), we blogged about &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/09/08/incremental.html&quot;&gt;Incremental Compilation&lt;/a&gt;. While that post goes into the details, the idea is basically this: when you’re working on a project, you often compile it, then change something small, then compile again. Historically, the compiler has compiled your &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; project, no matter how little you’ve changed the code. The idea with incremental compilation is that you only need to compile the code you’ve actually changed, which means that that second build is faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Rust 1.24, this is now &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/4817&quot;&gt;turned on by default&lt;/a&gt;. This means that your builds should get faster! Don’t forget about &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cargo check&lt;/code&gt; when trying to get the lowest possible build times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is still not the end story for compiler performance generally, nor incremental compilation specifically. We have a lot more work planned in the future. For example, another change related to performance hit stable this release: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/46910&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;codegen-units&lt;/code&gt; is now set to 16 by default&lt;/a&gt;. One small note about this change: it makes builds faster, but makes the final binary a bit slower. For maximum speed, setting &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;codegen-units&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Cargo.toml&lt;/code&gt; is needed to eke out every last drop of performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More to come!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;other-good-stuff&quot;&gt;Other good stuff&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s one other change we’d like to talk about here: undefined behavior. Rust generally strives to minimize undefined behavior, having none of it in safe code, and as little as possible in unsafe code. One area where you could invoke UB is when a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;panic!&lt;/code&gt; goes across an FFI boundary. In other words, this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-rust highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;C&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;panic_in_ffi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;panic!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cannot work, as the exact mechanism of how panics work would have to be reconciled with how the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;C&quot;&lt;/code&gt; ABI works, in this example, or any other ABI in other examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Rust 1.24, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/46833&quot;&gt;this code will now abort&lt;/a&gt; instead of producing undefined behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-1240-2018-02-15&quot;&gt;detailed release notes&lt;/a&gt; for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;library-stabilizations&quot;&gt;Library stabilizations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a fan of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;str::find&lt;/code&gt;, which is used to find a given &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; inside of a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;str&lt;/code&gt;, you’ll be happy to see this pull request: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/46735&quot;&gt;it’s now 10x faster&lt;/a&gt;! This is thanks to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;memchr&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[u8]::contains&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/46713&quot;&gt;uses it too&lt;/a&gt;, though it doesn’t get such an extreme speedup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a few new APIs were stabilized this release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, these functions may now be used inside a constant expression, for example, to initialize a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Cell&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RefCell&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UnsafeCell&lt;/code&gt;’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; functions of the various &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Atomic&lt;/code&gt; integer types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;{integer}::min_value&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;max_value&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mem&lt;/code&gt;’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;size_of&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;align_of&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ptr::null&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;null_mut&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-1240-2018-02-15&quot;&gt;detailed release notes&lt;/a&gt; for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;cargo-features&quot;&gt;Cargo features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big feature of this release was turning on incremental compilation by default, as mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-1240-2018-02-15&quot;&gt;detailed release notes&lt;/a&gt; for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;contributors-to-1240&quot;&gt;Contributors to 1.24.0&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people came together to create Rust 1.24. We couldn’t have done it without all of you. &lt;a href=&quot;https://thanks.rust-lang.org/rust/1.24.0&quot;&gt;Thanks!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Picking Apart the Crashing iOS String</title>
<link>https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2018/02/15/picking-apart-the-crashing-ios-string/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2018/02/15/picking-apart-the-crashing-ios-string/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;So there’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/15/17015654/apple-iphone-crash-ios-11-bug-imessage&quot;&gt;yet another iOS text crash&lt;/a&gt;, where just looking at a particular string crashes iOS. Basically, if you put this string in any system text box (and other places), it crashes that process. I’ve been testing it by copy-pasting characters into Spotlight so I don’t end up crashing my browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original sequence is U+0C1C U+0C4D U+0C1E U+200C U+0C3E, which is a sequence of Telugu characters: the consonant ja (జ), a virama ( ్ ), the consonant nya (ఞ), a zero-width non-joiner, and the vowel aa ( ా).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was pretty interested in what made this sequence “special”, and started investigating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So first when looking into this, I thought that the &amp;lt;ja, virama, nya&amp;gt; sequence was the culprit. That sequence forms a special ligature in many Indic scripts (ज्ञ in Devanagari) which is often considered a letter of its own. However, the ligature for Telugu doesn’t seem very “special”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, from some experimentation, this bug seemed to occur for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; pair of Telugu consonants with a vowel, as long as the vowel is not  ై (ai). Huh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ZWNJ must be doing something weird, then. &amp;lt;consonant, virama, consonant, vowel&amp;gt; is a pretty common sequence in any Indic script; but ZWNJ before a vowel isn’t very useful for most scripts (except for Bengali and Oriya, but I’ll get to that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I saw that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FakeUnicode/status/963300865762254848&quot;&gt;there was a sequence in Bengali&lt;/a&gt; that also crashed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sequence is U+09B8 U+09CD U+09B0 U+200C U+09C1, which is the consonant “so” (স), a virama ( ্ ), the consonant “ro” (র), a ZWNJ, and vowel u (  ু).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get too into this, let’s first take a little detour to learn how Indic scripts work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Indic scripts and consonant clusters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indic scripts are &lt;em&gt;abugidas&lt;/em&gt;; which means that their “letters” are consonants, which you can attach diacritics to to change the vowel. By default, consonants have a base vowel. So, for example, क is “kuh” (kə, often transcribed as “ka”), but I can change the vowel to make it के (the “ka” in “okay”) का (“kaa”, like “car”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, the default vowel is the ə sound, though not always (in Bengali it’s more of an o sound).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the “default” vowel, you need a way to combine consonants. For example, if you wished to write the word “ski”, you can’t write it as स + की (sa + ki = “saki”), you must write it as स्की. What’s happened here is that the स got its vowel “killed”, and got tacked on to the की to form a consonant cluster ligature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; write this as स्‌की . That little tail you see on the स is known as a “virama”; it basically means “remove this vowel”. Explicit viramas are sometimes used when there’s no easy way to form a ligature, e.g. in ङ्‌ठ because there is no simple way to ligatureify ङ into ठ. Some scripts also &lt;em&gt;prefer&lt;/em&gt; explicit viramas, e.g. “ski” in Malayalam is written as സ്കീ, where the little crescent is the explicit virama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In unicode, the virama character is always used to form a consonant cluster. So स्की was written as &amp;lt;स,  ्, क,  ी&amp;gt;, or &amp;lt;sa, virama, ka, i&amp;gt;. If the font supports the cluster, it will show up as a ligature, otherwise it will use an explicit virama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Devanagari and Bengali, &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt;, in a consonant cluster the first consonant is munged a bit and the second consonant stays intact. There are exceptions – sometimes they’ll form an entirely new glyph (क + ष = क्ष), and sometimes both glyphs will change (ड + ड = ड्ड, द + म = द्म, द + ब = द्ब). Those last ones should look like this in conjunct form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;https://manishearth.github.io/images/post/unicode-crash/conjuncts.png&quot; width=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Investigating the Bengali case&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, interestingly, unlike the Telugu crash, the Bengali crash seemed to only occur when the second consonant is র (“ro”). However, I can trigger it for any choice of the first consonant or vowel, except when the vowel is  ৌ (au).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, র is an interesting consonant in some Indic scripts, including Devanagari. In Devanagari, it looks like र (“ra”). However, it does all kinds of things when forming a cluster. If you’re having it precede another consonant in a cluster, it forms a little feather-like stroke, like in र्क (rka). In Marathi, that stroke can also look like a tusk, as in र्‍क. As a suffix consonant, it can provide a little “extra leg”, as in क्र (kra). For letters without a vertical stroke, like ठ (tha), it does this caret-like thing, ठ्र (thra).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, while most consonants retain some of their form when put inside a cluster, र does not. And a more special thing about र is that this happens even when र is the &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; consonant in a cluster – as I mentioned before, for most consonant clusters the second consonant stays intact. While there are exceptions, they are usually specific to the cluster; it is only र for which this happens for all clusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s similar in Bengali, র as the second consonant adds a tentacle-like thing on the existing consonant. For example, প + র (po + ro) gives প্র (pro).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just র that does this in Bengali, the consonant “jo” does as well. প + য (po + jo) forms প্য (pjo), and the য is transformed into a wavy line called a “jophola”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I tried it with য — , and it turns out that the Bengali crash occurs for য as well! So the general Bengali case is &amp;lt;consonant, virama, র OR য, ZWNJ, vowel&amp;gt;, where the vowel is not  ৌ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Suffix-joining consonants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we’re getting close, here. At least for Bengali, it occurs when the second consonant is such that it often combines with the first consonant without modifying its form much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, this is the case for Telugu as well! Consonant clusters in Telugu are usually formed by preserving the original consonant, and tacking the second consonant on below!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the original crashy string contains the cluster జ + ఞ, which looks like జ్ఞ. The first letter isn’t really modified, but the second is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this, we can guess that it will also occur for Devanagari with र. Indeed it does! U+0915 U+094D U+0930 U+200C U+093E, that is, &amp;lt;क,  ्, र, zwnj, ा&amp;gt; (&amp;lt; ka, virama, ra, zwnj, aa &amp;gt;) is one such crashing sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this isn’t really the whole story, is it? For example, the crash does occur for “kro” + zwnj + vowel in Bengali, and in “kro” (ক্র = ক + র = ko + ro) the resultant cluster involves the munging of both the prefix and suffix. But the crash doesn’t occur for द्ब or ड्ड. It seems to be specific to the letter, not the nature of the cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digging deeper, the reason is that for many fonts (presumably the ones in use), these consonants form “suffix joining consonants” (a term I made up) when preceded by a virama&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the sequence virama + क gives   ्क, i.e. it renders a virama with a placeholder followed by a क.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, for र, virama + र renders  ्र, which for me looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;https://manishearth.github.io/images/post/unicode-crash/virama-ra.png&quot; width=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, this is the case for the other consonants as well. For me,  ्र  ্র  ্য  ్ఞ  ్క (Devanagari virama-ra, Bengali virama-ro, Bengali virama-jo, Telugu virama-nya, Telugu virama-ka) all render as “suffix joining consonants”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;https://manishearth.github.io/images/post/unicode-crash/virama-consonant.png&quot; width=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This is true for all Telugu consonants, not just the ones listed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kannada &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; has “suffix joining consonants”, but for some reason I cannot trigger the crash with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The ZWNJ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ZWNJ is curious. The crash doesn’t happen without it, but as I mentioned before a ZWNJ before a vowel doesn’t really &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; anything for most Indic scripts. In Indic scripts, a ZWNJ can be used to explicitly force a virama if used after the virama (I used it to write स्‌की in this post), however that’s not how it’s being used here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bengali and Oriya specifically, a ZWNJ can be used to force a different vowel form when used before a vowel (e.g. রু vs র‌ু), however this bug seems to apply to vowels for which there is only one form, and this bug also applies to other scripts where this isn’t the case anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Generalizing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, ultimately, the full set of cases that cause the crash are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any sequence &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;consonant1, virama, consonant2, ZWNJ, vowel&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in Devanagari, Bengali, and Telugu, where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;consonant2&lt;/code&gt; is suffix-joining – i.e. र, র, য, and all Telugu consonants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;vowel&lt;/code&gt; is not  ై or  ৌ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This leaves some questions open:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why doesn’t it apply to Kannada? Or, for that matter, Khmer, which has a similar virama-like thing called a “coeng”. What’s up with the exception vowels in Bengali and Telugu?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t really have &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; guess as to what’s going on here – I’d love to see what people think – but my current guess is that the “affinity” of the virama to the left instead of the right confuses the algorithm that handles ZWNJs after viramas into thinking the ZWNJ applies to the virama (it doesn’t, there’s a consonant in between), and this leads to some numbers not matching up and causing a buffer overflow or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting thing is that I can cause this crash to happen more reliably in browsers by clicking on the string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt; it actually renders in spotlight for a split second before crashing; which means that either the crash isn’t deterministic, or it occurs in some process &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; rendering. I’m not sure what to think of either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d love to hear if folks have further insight into this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Yes, I could attach a debugger to the crashing process and investigate that instead, but that’s no fun 😂&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Hey Microsoft, Stop Installing Apps on My PC Without Asking</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.howtogeek.com/342871/hey-microsoft-stop-installing-apps-on-my-pc-without-asking/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-342872&quot; data-pagespeed-lazy-src=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ximg_5a834e83ca2de.png.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+ws+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic.Nwi3w5qHlR.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif&quot; onload=&quot;pagespeed.lazyLoadImages.loadIfVisibleAndMaybeBeacon(this);&quot; onerror=&quot;this.onerror=null;pagespeed.lazyLoadImages.loadIfVisibleAndMaybeBeacon(this);&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m getting sick of Windows 10’s auto-installing apps. Apps like Facebook are now showing up out of nowhere, and even displaying notifications begging for me to use them. I didn’t install the Facebook app, I didn’t give it permission to show notifications, and I’ve never even used it. So why is it bugging me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows 10 has always been a little annoying about these apps, but it wasn’t always this bad. Microsoft went from “we pinned a few tiles, but the apps aren’t installed until you click them” to “the apps are now automatically installed on your PC” to “the automatically installed apps are now sending you notifications”. It’s ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The “Microsoft Consumer Experience” Is Consumer-Hostile…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/259946/how-to-get-rid-of-suggested-apps-in-windows-10/&quot;&gt;“Microsoft Consumer Experience” program&lt;/a&gt;, which can’t be disabled on normal Windows 10 Home or Professional systems. That’s why every Windows 10 computer you start using has these bonus apps. The exact apps preinstalled can vary, but I’ve never seen a Windows 10 PC without Candy Crush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft Consumer Experience is actually a background task that runs whenever you sign into a Windows 10 PC with a new user account for the first time. It kicks into gear and automatically downloads apps like Candy Crush Soda Saga, FarmVille 2: Country Escape, Facebook, TripAdvisor, and whatever else Microsoft feels like promoting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can uninstall the apps from your Start menu, and they shouldn’t come back on your user account the same hardware. However, the apps will also come back whenever you sign into a new PC with the same Microsoft account, forcing you to remove them on each device you use. And, if someone signs into your same PC with their own Microsoft account, Microsoft will “helpfully” download those apps for their account as well. There’s no way to tell Microsoft “stop downloading these apps on my PC” or “I never want these apps on this Microsoft account”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;…and Microsoft Won’t Let Us Disable It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, technically, a way to disable this and stop Windows from installing these apps…but it’s only for Windows 10 Enterprise and Education users. Even if you spent $200 for a Windows 10 Professional license because you want to use your PC for business, Microsoft won’t let you stop the “Consumer Experience” on a professional PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group policy or registry setting that disables this feature originally worked on Windows 10 Home and Professional in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/232176/whats-new-in-windows-10s-first-big-update-the-windows-10-fall-update/&quot;&gt;November 2015 update&lt;/a&gt; when Microsoft originally added the Consumer Experience. But Microsoft went out of their way to make Home and Professional ignore this setting in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/248177/whats-new-in-windows-10s-anniversary-update/&quot;&gt;Anniversary Update&lt;/a&gt;. Now, only Enterprise and Education respect that preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;These Apps Shouldn’t Be Able to Send Notifications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-342879&quot; data-pagespeed-lazy-src=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ximg_5a83578648a5f.png.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+ws+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic.XidRhAP2t5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif&quot; onload=&quot;pagespeed.lazyLoadImages.loadIfVisibleAndMaybeBeacon(this);&quot; onerror=&quot;this.onerror=null;pagespeed.lazyLoadImages.loadIfVisibleAndMaybeBeacon(this);&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s one thing for Microsoft to say “those apps just use a tiny bit of space, so what’s the harm?” But when the apps are installed by default and begin nagging you with advertisements (I mean notifications), it’s just too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This demonstrates a deeper problem with Windows 10’s app permission system, too. All apps get permission to show you notifications without asking you, even if Microsoft installed them on your PC against your wishes. You can disable notifications for an individual app, but all apps get permission to send them when they’re installed. On an iPhone or iPad, apps don’t get permission to show you notifications until they ask you nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe Microsoft’s permissions system would make sense if they Windows 10 didn’t automatically install apps on our PCs. But, since Microsoft is going to force these apps on us, the least they could do is make them ask before sending notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft Bundled a Password Manager Whose Browser Extension Was Insecure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has even caused some problems for users with this feature. Microsoft previously bundled the “Keeper” password manager with Windows 10, which prompted users to install a browser plugin. That plugin &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/12/microsoft-is-forcing-users-to-install-a-critically-flawed-password-manager/&quot;&gt;had a bug&lt;/a&gt; that resulted in “a complete compromise of Keeper security, allowing any website to steal any password”, according to Google security researcher Tavis Ormandy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security flaw wasn’t actually in the Keeper app Microsoft installed, but in the Keeper browser extension it asked you to install. In theory, almost everyone who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/141500/why-you-should-use-a-password-manager-and-how-to-get-started/&quot;&gt;uses a password manager&lt;/a&gt; would likely install its corresponding browser extension, since that’s what makes password managers useful. Look, we get it: bugs happen, and Keeper has since patched the hole. But this story demonstrated how Microsoft is pushing products it isn’t responsible for, and that isn’t a great thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much due diligence does Microsoft perform on the apps it chooses to install on users’ PCs? We really don’t know, as Microsoft won’t say what standards it holds these apps to or why it makes decisions to install the ones it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Please, Microsoft: Just Let Us Disable the “Consumer Experience”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-342880&quot; data-pagespeed-lazy-src=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ximg_5a8358171a73e.png.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+ws+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic.XWQYxDEfuZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif&quot; onload=&quot;pagespeed.lazyLoadImages.loadIfVisibleAndMaybeBeacon(this);&quot; onerror=&quot;this.onerror=null;pagespeed.lazyLoadImages.loadIfVisibleAndMaybeBeacon(this);&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These preinstalled apps are just one part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/269331/how-to-disable-all-of-windows-10s-built-in-advertising/&quot;&gt;the mess of advertising in Windows 10&lt;/a&gt;, but they feel worse somehow. Microsoft isn’t even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/267369/how-to-disable-notifications-in-windows-file-explorer/&quot;&gt;advertising their own products&lt;/a&gt;—they’re advertising other companies’ applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear what back-scratching is going on here. Are companies like Facebook, King (makers of Candy Crush), and Zynga (makers of FarmVille) paying Microsoft for this privilege? Or is Microsoft is so desperate for apps in the Windows Store that they promise to force apps on users’ PCs, if only companies will make them first?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either situation is bad. Microsoft should at least give Windows users a way to disable this “feature”, if not end the entire Microsoft Consumer Experience program entirely for the good of its customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, even if Microsoft makes no other change, they should at least remove notification permissions from these automatically installed apps. Come on, Microsoft. This is all just one step too far.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>As we age, cancer rates go up as immune system winds down</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share this story&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dominant idea about how cancer gets started is called the &quot;two-hit hypothesis.&quot; First proposed by Alfred Knudson in 1971, it holds that a cancer starts when one cell gets a mutation in both of its copies of a gene that normally blocks cancer formation (two hits). These two mutations disable the tumor-suppressing function in that cell, which then becomes cancerous. Eventually, the idea was expanded to include two hits not necessarily in the same gene but, rather, in genes controlling the same tumor-suppressing pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a new idea is challenging the two-hit hypothesis, shifting the focus to the role of the immune system in suppressing cancers. It's an idea that could have big implications for treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taking a hit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting two hits in one cell was considered to be a random and unlucky event. Since mutations occur each time a cell divides, the more times each cell divides, the greater the chances that it would happen. This was why, it was thought, cancer incidence increases with age; the longer a cell has been around, and the more times it has divided, the more opportunities it has had to accrue the two requisite mutations in the same tumor-suppressor pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence for the two-hit hypothesis came primarily from children with retinoblastoma, who have a germline mutation in the RB1 gene (named for the disease it causes) and are therefore born with one hit in every cell already. These kids usually end up with tumors in their eyes by the time they turn five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personalized medicine has been focused on the two-hit model. The idea is to identify the key mutations in a given cancer, then target and nullify them. It has been touted as the wave of the future for a while, but its successes have been mixed. Not every cancer has an obvious target gene, and many tumors can evolve resistance to targeted drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunotherapy, by contrast, has achieved some striking successes. Much of it relies on engineered T cells designed and synthesized to kill specific tumor cells. But it also involves awakening the body's existing T cells, which would go on to help fight the tumor. Tumors generally have proteins on their surface that can activate T cells, but they also have mechanisms to suppress the immune system. Cancer immunotherapy relieves this suppression, freeing the T cells to fight the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Immunity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new analysis suggests that the relationship between the immune system and tumor cells provides not only the basis for this new therapeutic approach but also the explanation for increased cancer incidence as we age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T cells arise in the thymus (that’s why they’re called T cells), but the thymus starts to atrophy around the time we turn one and the number of viable T cells it churns out drops continually over time. Mathematical modeling suggests that cancers do not primarily arise because getting two hits in one cell becomes more likely as we age. Instead, cancer-causing mutations seem to occur at roughly the same rate over the course of our lives, but our T cells wipe out these proto-cancer cells before they become clinically problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is only as our reservoir of T cells declines as we age that one of these continuously produced cancer cells can overcome immune surveillance and blossom into disease. The same immune system decline would explain the rising incidence of infectious diseases with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors cite a couple of observations supporting their model. One is that women get fewer cancers than men, since they have more circulating T cells and their T cell levels drop at lower rates. Another is that sharks, which have notoriously low cancer rates, do not experience this thymic atrophy as they age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also make a few practical recommendations. Nine out of ten of the cancers that best fit this new model have rates that spike in the late fifties, so they suggest that this might be a good age for more stringent cancer screening. And especially given the success that immunotherapies have already had in fighting some types of cancers, they suggest that more therapies that shore up T cell production or alleviate T cell exhaustion might be a better bet than trying to counteract or even prevent specific cancer-causing mutations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to emphasize that the two models aren't completely exclusive—mutations are still important for a cancer's development and progression, and they can still be targeted with treatments. The new proposal just drives home that, even if a cell picks up damaging mutations, it won't go on to form a cancer if the immune system kills it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Tractor Hacking: Documentary About Farmers Fighting for the Right to Repair</title>
<link>https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pamkqn/watch-tractor-hacking-john-deere-right-to-repair-documentary</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pamkqn/watch-tractor-hacking-john-deere-right-to-repair-documentary</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;About a year ago, I found out about a &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xykkkd/why-american-farmers-are-hacking-their-tractors-with-ukrainian-firmware&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;community of farmers&lt;/a&gt; who trade firmware hacks for John Deere tractors on forums and torrent sites. These aren’t criminals; they’re average farmers who are frustrated with and increasingly economically destroyed by the fact that Deere and other big agriculture companies have monopolized the repair of their tractors. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proprietary software locks prevent the average farmer and mechanic from diagnosing problems with their equipment, and many parts cannot be replaced unless software locks are bypassed to enable the replacement part. The forums I found were interesting, but there’s only so much reporting you can do from a computer and telephone in New York.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motherboard &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/kzp7ny/tractor-hacking-right-to-repair&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;went to Nebraska&lt;/a&gt; to meet the farmers on the frontline of the right to repair movement, which operates under the principle that if you buy something, you should be able to do whatever you want to it, including fix it when it breaks. Some farmers, like Kyle Schwarting, have taken matters into their own hands: They find pirated software that allows them to fix their equipment today. Meanwhile, other farmers have pushed for legislation that would require John Deere and other manufacturers to sell replacement parts, make repair guides available, and distribute diagnostic software that will once again empower farmers to fix their tractors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Brief Glance at How Various Text Editors Manage Their Textual Data (2015)</title>

<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google&amp;gt; chinese proverb efficiency&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Efficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is doing the right things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;span itemprop=&quot;creator&quot;&gt;Peter F. Drucker&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Not quite chinese, but sounds wise enough&lt;em&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
A review of how GNU Moe, Plan 9 Sam, Bill Joy's Ex/Vi, GNOME GtkTextView/GtkTextBuffer, GNU Emacs, and due to popular demand, Scintilla, manage their textual data. This article is subject to updates.&lt;h3&gt;Foreword&lt;/h3&gt;
This is a short review of how various text editors manage their textual data within a single buffer. Like many programmers, I have a fascination with text editors. We only want the best tools for the job - so what does the best mean? For some, they want editing to have high physical efficiency - using keyboard shortcuts and command keys, maybe the odd time the mouse comes in handy. Others want their editors to be virtually efficient - to make the most out of their resources (RAM, disk space) - or to be &quot;small&quot;. There is a race though to have all of these - and the editors mentioned in this  article allow you to see what their authors decided to go with.&lt;p&gt;You get three choices, and may choose two:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/OSIUpSK.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/LQVDVrzLs2wimvJtlBY96omdFwzWg0ePvjy9BKP9WZERGOZPIFB6IxljxsPLeeZTGfo=s0-d&quot; width=&quot;320&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each editor section includes a copy of this diagram with the properties they have highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Note: This is in no way 100% accurate representation of these text editors. A text editor is a complex application, so there are many pros (and cons) that this review ignores or does not cover.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with that, lets begin our journey.&lt;/p&gt;

First public release: &lt;span&gt;September 6th 2005&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/BrEC4Ca.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/e-XBkvvs6SW3JQw61QizoIQscFfJ9dINTsrpKNd4x1g5w0RrKJYZKBd_g-NFNDQOPHU=s0-d&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;GNU Moe is a powerful, 8-bit clean, console text editor for ISO-8859 and ASCII character encodings. It has a modeless, user-friendly interface, online help, multiple windows, unlimited undo/redo capability, unlimited line length, global search/replace (on all buffers at once), block operations, automatic indentation, word wrapping, file name completion, directory browser, duplicate removal from prompt histories, delimiter matching, text conversion from/to UTF-8, romanization, etc.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;TL;DR: Almost like GNU Nano (on the surface).&lt;p&gt;From my observations, Moe is a small C++ console text editor. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; easy to use. The code base is easy to navigate, as it remains small and simple. It took me around 5-10 minutes to find insertion-related code. Like it says in the TL;DR, if Nano didn't exist, Moe would certainly be its replacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moe sees its text as a &lt;em&gt;list&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;lines&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;columns&lt;/em&gt;. It accesses the data as a 2D array: &lt;span&gt;data[line][col]&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The buffer is initialized as a &lt;em&gt;vector&lt;/em&gt; with 10,000 lines. If a file is loaded with more than 10,000 lines, or surpasses this limit while editing, it will add 1/10th of the amount of max lines to the buffer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means Moe always uses &lt;span&gt;(vector*(10000*lines))&lt;/span&gt; when it's started. It isn't often I open files that are 10,000 lines, so this would be wasteful for my uses. This behavior only becomes useful after the 10,000 line mark, although a little wasteful. If say while typing we hit the 1,000,000 line mark, Moe will allocate space for 100,000 lines. This is not very resource efficient, unless you are someone who typically types an additional 100,000 lines after your millionth line. Besides that though, Moe has a simple interface, easy and memorable keyboard shortcuts, and small program size, which makes it suitable for embedded systems, but only if they are equipped with a generous amount of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
First public release: 1980s&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/VaSIzG7.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/ar3CEd_vufrE8gAMHS1zaL0iYFNC__0cd-fERoc0D08yawuJBLjtypyHHSL2XwPM1Bc=s0-d&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&quot;Sam is an interactive multi-file text editor intended for bitmap displays. A textual command language supplements the mouse-driven, cut-and-paste interface to make complex or repetitive editing tasks easy to specify.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sam is relatively small when compared to Vim and Emacs - in fact it is probably the second or most smallest editor mentioned in this review. It is ed's successor, but much more generic. Sam works on the character-level instead of the line-level. It is one of the first editors to separate its UI from the actual editor - Sam can be used on both the command-line and as a graphical text editor. Its command language makes it scriptable too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sam's data is linear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sam manages a buffer as a variable-sized block, starting at 8&lt;span&gt;KiB&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;It will expand itself by &lt;span&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; bytes after the 8&lt;span&gt;KiB&lt;/span&gt; point, or if &lt;span&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; bytes is greater than 8&lt;span&gt;KiB&lt;/span&gt;, however many times &lt;span&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; fits into 8&lt;span&gt;KiB&lt;/span&gt; blocks. The remainder of the bytes are put into a final 8&lt;span&gt;KiB&lt;/span&gt; block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes Sam a fairly efficient editor. From what I've read, it will cache and write blocks to disk when navigating through its data to preserve RAM. An issue that is only apparent is when you are working with huge files, but unlikely to occur. As a user, if you decide to open up a 20 GB file (bare with me), Sam will write all &lt;span&gt;((20GB/8KiB) - 8KiB)&lt;/span&gt; blocks to disk. Your disk may be 40GB large, and half of that is taken up by this monstrous 20GB file, that leaves us with 20GB, which lets say 10GB is taken by the operating system and other files. Now we have 10GB, which is not enough for Sam's caching. This is probably a rare case though, and is most likely safe to ignore. Overall I'd say Sam is fairly efficient at managing the growth of its buffer, but requires O(n) time to insert/delete text. It is not a very physically efficient either. Its command language definitely helps (and is the best part about Sam), but leaves for more to be desired. As mentioned earlier, its program size is fairly small too, even for being statically linked on Plan 9.&lt;/p&gt;
First public release: 1976&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/BrEC4Ca.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/e-XBkvvs6SW3JQw61QizoIQscFfJ9dINTsrpKNd4x1g5w0RrKJYZKBd_g-NFNDQOPHU=s0-d&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&quot;Vi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; (visual) is a display oriented text editor based on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(1). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;vi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; run the same code; it is possible to get to the command mode of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; from within &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;vi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and vice-versa.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was shocked to see what the original vi's code looked like. It was full of hacks and tried to be clever by managing the terminal (it handles 2 separate real terminals) and using it to read lines back to the buffer. It took me almost an hour to find the code that actually placed text into the buffer. On the bright side though...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;...Vi is still small when compared to its bigger brother Vim. It is fast and efficient because of its design for 300 baud connections and terminals. Like Sam, Vi also has its own command language that can both be scripted and keyed, meaning the commands happen has you type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a descendant of Ed, Vi is also a line-based text editor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vi represents its buffer as an array of lines. It simply adds or deletes lines where it has to, which is very similar to how GNU Moe does it, as we discussed earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Vi is at or past the end of its buffer, it will request more lines. If the system supports pages, and the page isn't zero or a ridiculously high number, then Vi will allocate the page size divided by the size of a line in bytes, and resize the buffer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the page size is zero or a ridiculous number, then it will extend the buffer by 4KiB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise if none of the above happens, Vi will extend the buffer by 1KiB worth of lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Vi uses a similar method to Sam to grow its buffer. This is very efficient, but the consequence is Vi will become slow when working with huge files, because it has to traverse through a bigger linear array. It will have a hard time working with large lines. Luckily in the real world, large lines are not a common thing to encounter in source code files. Vi is mostly known for its powerful physical efficiency though, so people who use it rarely care for either of these.&lt;/p&gt;
First public release: April 14th 1998&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/0G40vot.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/_CeGC6N4o3-ZPShk1_uWr93zbTFa_kDJu5DgpVXVFgEJTM4oj_9MssXm6rAQQt1ahgE=s0-d&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&quot;GTK+ has an extremely powerful framework for multiline text editing. The primary objects involved in the process are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkTextBuffer.html&quot; title=&quot;GtkTextBuffer&quot;&gt;GtkTextBuffer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which represents the text being edited, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkTextView.html&quot; title=&quot;GtkTextView&quot;&gt;GtkTextView&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a widget which can display a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkTextBuffer.html&quot; title=&quot;GtkTextBuffer&quot;&gt;GtkTextBuffer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Each buffer can be displayed by any number of views.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One of the important things to remember about text in GTK+ is that it's in the UTF-8 encoding.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Featureful and developed over the years, GtkTextView coupled with GtkTextBuffer makes extending functionality of this editor easy. A good example of extending these is GtkSourceView, which adds source code support. It is easy to hack and build an editor from scratch in a night (see: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lf94/tyreese&quot;&gt;tyreese&lt;/a&gt;, my very simple editor). Unlike majority of editors, it supports UTF-8 and separates UI from the editor (actually in this case, it goes a step further and separates the UI from the editor and the editor from the buffer!). It is very well made. Essentially the definition of modern text editing.&lt;p&gt; GtkTextBuffer actually uses a GtkTextBTree. This is simply a binary tree data structure - or the proper term: rope data structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When text is inserted, GtkTextBTree creates new segments (nodes) and puts the new text into them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When text is deleted, the segments are simply removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only issue with this is that you have to build an editor out of these components. This makes the virtual efficiency very high, but consequently has terrible physical efficiency, and you have to invest the time into creating a reliable interface (most likely just a vi overlay). I'm surprised programmers haven't created overlays for Vi or Emacs for the GtkTextView. Definitely an opportunity for someone there. Another disadvantage is in order to use these components, you have to include the entire GTK+ library. This makes any GTK+ based editor larger than other editors (although rare, surprisingly!), but very portable. A GTK+ editor has a good chance of running on Windows, Mac, GNU/Linux, *BSD, and even in web browsers, thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/gtk-broadway.html&quot;&gt;Broadway project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
First public release: March 20th 1985&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/cz6OGo0.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/znaKMpbBlR7neCIyUtmId4udPvLUmNKkVJNuxnYtwZ_AIzpqk_dJfjW1oTf2AhNXdwo=s0-d&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;GNU Emacs is an extensible, customizable text editor—and more. At its core is an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the &lt;/span&gt;Lisp programming language&lt;span&gt; with extensions to support text editing.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A better description would probably be &quot;Emacs can be anything you want it to be&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I actually began to re-use Emacs again. Its extensibility is just unparalleled by anything. It also separates its UI from the editor part, allowing for different UIs and not being restricted to terminals. This is absolutely awesome for people coming from Vi. I'm one of those people. As soon as I installed Emacs 24, all I had to do to get Vi functionality was M-x list-packages, navigate to the Evil package, install, restart Emacs, and boom. I was right at home. This makes Emacs dangerously powerful. To be able to slap on any front end and get the same Emacs functionality too is just awesome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Emacs uses a data structure called a gap buffer. It splits the text into three parts - the first part, the gap, and the second part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gap grows and shrinks depending on insert and deletions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the gap becomes too small, a new gap is created. This is very efficient for insertions and deletions, and O(n) for navigation. This makes it slightly worse than ropes, but better than the majority of solutions out there. In fact, because of its simplicity, editor creators opt for gap buffers because they make their code easier to maintain and to work with the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emacs is both physically (if you for example install the Evil package) and virtually efficient, but at the price of bigger program size. In the age of computers with at least 100GB disks and at least 1GB RAM, this is not an issue. This is why I've opted for Emacs as my editor for the time being...&lt;/p&gt;
First public release: March 14th 1999&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/PJ2JsnL.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/ql69_Yn2Cf23iUaKGcg4DXOxo4_z_q11IwgsmoWtnVHs6CzM-Idu_VmG5aF78g3vki8=s0-d&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;SciTE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is a SCIntilla based Text Editor. Originally built to demonstrate Scintilla, it has grown to be a generally useful editor with facilities for building and running programs. It is best used for jobs with simple configurations - I use it for building test and demonstration programs as well as SciTE and Scintilla, themselves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Due to popular demand, I've added Scintilla to this page. Scintilla is the basis for many text editors on Windows. It is architecturally very similar to GTKTextView/GtkTextBuffer. Scintilla separates itself into 3 parts: Editor, Document, and CellBuffer. As the authors of Scintilla have noted, it is best suited for prototypes (&quot;simple configurations&quot;).&lt;p&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Scintilla unfortunately opts for inferior textual data management. It is very similar to GNU Moe, using a list of lines. Unlike GNU Moe though,&lt;/strike&gt; Scintilla is thread-safe and uses a reader-writer architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huge apology to Neil, I messed up. Here's his comment that clarifies what Scintilla really does:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Author of Scintilla here. Scintilla does not use a list of lines. The text is stored in a gap buffer (the substance field in the code shown), like EMACS. Line start positions (added by the InsertLine method) are also stored in a gap buffer but with a 'step' which enables modifications in close proximity to affect few elements.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Scintilla parses a string until it sees a return carriage or new line control code (trying to compensate for UNIX and Windows line-endings). Once it does, it simply adds the line to the buffer.&lt;p&gt;This means Scintilla doesn't waste space while growing its buffer. It will always use the optimum amount of space for storing text in memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is inefficient about this is if you have a giant line, Scintilla will slow right down, because it goes through every character in the block to determine where new lines are. So if you copy &amp;amp; paste from an external source, you could potentially see a slow down. As a code editor though, this should rarely be a problem. Like GtkTextView, Scintilla's Editor interface is lacking key binding overlays to allow users to use Vi or Emacs keybindings out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
It was interesting to see how these editors each approached the textual data management problem. What amazes me even more is that this was only feasible because of the FOSS world we have. If these projects were not open source, I would have never done this study to improve my knowledge of how the tools I use every day work. Thank you FOSS enthusiasts.&lt;p&gt;If you'd like me to add an editor, email me or leave a comment here. I'd be glad to look at it for you :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep being awesome&lt;em&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>It&amp;#039;s Getting Harder to Tell Banks from Tech Companies</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-02-15/lloyd-blankfein-wants-goldman-sachs-to-push-technology</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-02-15/lloyd-blankfein-wants-goldman-sachs-to-push-technology</guid>
<description>&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This post originally appeared in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-02-13/deutsche-bank-did-some-bond-lyinghttps://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-02-14/is-vix-manipulated-or-hedged&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Money Stuff&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, someone invented the XIV ETN. And someone invented the VIX, and VIX futures. And when you read the technical specifications for all of those things, it is clear that they are not trivial feats of engineering. Teams of marketers and traders and quants and technologists and lawyers put many hours into getting them just right, so that they would work as intended. They are technologies, highly engineered tools designed to help customers do things that they couldn't have done before. They are &lt;em&gt;financial &lt;/em&gt;technologies, built not out of screens and circuit boards but out of formulas and hedging strategies and legal documents, but that is what you'd expect: Financial firms ought to innovate in financial technology.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Yesterday Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein presented at the Credit Suisse Financial Services Conference, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goldmansachs.com/investor-relations/presentations/2018-credit-suisse-deck.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; data-web-url=&quot;http://www.goldmansachs.com/investor-relations/presentations/2018-credit-suisse-deck.pdf&quot;&gt;his presentation&lt;/a&gt; is kind of a weird read. The running theme is that Goldman is doing technology stuff to win business. &quot;Engineering underpins our growth initiatives,&quot; says a summary page, and it doesn't mean financial engineering. In fixed income, currencies and commodities, engineers are 25 percent of headcount, and the presentation touts growth in Marquee (its client-facing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-sachs-has-started-giving-away-its-most-valuable-software-1473242401&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-sachs-has-started-giving-away-its-most-valuable-software-1473242401&quot;&gt;software platform&lt;/a&gt;) and &quot;systematic market making.&quot; In equities, Goldman touts its quant relationships. In consumer banking (now a thing!), the centerpiece is Marcus, Goldman's online savings and lending platform. And in investment banking, &quot;Engineering enhances client engagement through apps, machine learning and big data analytics.&quot; Apps! I hope there is an Uber-for-mergers app: You put in your location and the enterprise value of your deal, and it tells you that a Goldman Sachs banker will be at your office within 7 minutes. Of course the dream is that one day she won't even need to show up, and the app will do the whole merger for you.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is obviously good and sensible. Making finance more efficient is good, reaching out to customers with technology is good, a big investment bank is probably as well positioned to build banking and trading apps as anyone else. It is just &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt;, though. Instead of developing new &lt;em&gt;financial &lt;/em&gt;technologies, Goldman is developing new &lt;em&gt;computer &lt;/em&gt;technologies for its financial clients. &lt;em&gt;Financial &lt;/em&gt;technology itself, the business of engineering new tools of finance, is perhaps stagnating a bit. &quot;People are -- not unreasonably -- skeptical of financial innovation that is actually &lt;em&gt;financial &lt;/em&gt;innovation, that finds new ways to slice cash flows and allocate risks,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-12-04/bank-backups-and-space-bitcoins&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;I wrote&lt;/a&gt; a little while ago. Now the innovation is in apps.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(Disclosure: I used to work at Goldman designing derivatives, not apps. Also I have a Marcus savings account.)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>MongoDB gets support for multi-document ACID transactions</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/15/mongodb-gets-support-for-multi-document-acid-transactions/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/15/mongodb-gets-support-for-multi-document-acid-transactions/</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/gettyimages-598748848.jpg?w=738&quot; class=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.mongodb.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt; is finally getting support for multi-document &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) transactions&lt;/a&gt;. That’s something the MongoDB community has been asking for for years and MongoDB Inc, the company behind the project, is now about to make this a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;As the company will announce at an event later today, support for ACID transactions will launch when it ships version 4.0 of its NoSQL database in the summer. Until then, developers can &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.mongodb.com/transactions&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;use a beta&lt;/a&gt;, though, to see how they can make use of this new feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, MongoDB is a document database and — almost by default — these kind of databases aren’t ACID compliant, especially when it comes to multi-document transactions (at the document level, MongoDB already supports ACID transactions). For the most part, that’s not a big deal for companies that use database systems like MongoDB because they are not trying to write to multiple documents at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, though, many MongoDB users still run relational databases in parallel with their document database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, as MongoDB co-founder and CTO Eliot Horowitz told me, that was one of the main motivations behind this project. “The reason we didn’t need this is because the document model negates the need for ACID transactions — not for all of them, but for most of them,” he told me. But at the same time, there are clearly use cases where developers wants transactions for their mission critical use cases. Horowitz also argues that some developers who start working with MongoDB “have this nagging fear that they may need it in the future.” This launch obvious takes that fear away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“Transactional guarantees have been a critical feature for relational databases for decades, but have typically been absent from non-relational alternatives, which has meant that users have been forced to choose between transactions and the flexibility and versatility that non-relational databases offer,” said Stephen O’Grady, Principal Analyst with RedMonk. “With its support for multi-document ACID transactions, MongoDB is built for customers that want to have their cake and eat it too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horowitz stressed that he doesn’t believe developers will simply turn this feature on by default and that most will only enable it for very specific use cases. “I don’t expect this to be a common way to write to MongoDB,” he told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building this new feature was a multi-year effort that started with the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.mongodb.com/press/wired-tiger&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;acquisition of WiredTiger&lt;/a&gt; and that company’s database storage engine three years ago. To enable it, the team touched virtually every component of the database system.&lt;/p&gt;

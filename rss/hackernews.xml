<title>Distrust of Symantec TLS Certificates</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/03/12/distrust-symantec-tls-certificates/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/03/12/distrust-symantec-tls-certificates/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A Certification Authority (CA) is an organization that browser vendors (like Mozilla) trust to issue certificates to websites. Last year, Mozilla published and discussed a set of &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:Symantec_Issues&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt; with one of the oldest and largest CAs run by Symantec. The discussion resulted in the adoption of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/msg/blink-dev/eUAKwjihhBs/El1mH8S6AwAJ&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;consensus proposal&lt;/a&gt; to gradually remove trust in all Symantec TLS/SSL certificates from Firefox. The proposal includes a number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.security.policy/FLHRT79e3XE/90qkf8jsAQAJ&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;phases designed to minimize the impact of the change to Firefox users&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;January 2018 (Firefox 58): Notices in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Browser_Console&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Browser Console&lt;/a&gt; warn about Symantec certificates issued before 2016-06-01, to encourage site owners to replace their TLS certificates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May 2018 (Firefox 60): Websites will show an untrusted connection error if they use a TLS certificate issued before 2016-06-01 that chains up to a Symantec root certificate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October 2018 (Firefox 63): Distrust of Symantec root certificates for website server TLS authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the consensus proposal was adopted, the Symantec CA was acquired by DigiCert; however, that fact has not changed &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2017/10/31/statement-digicerts-proposed-purchase-symantec/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mozilla’s commitment to implement the proposal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox 60 is expected to &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease/Calendar&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;enter Beta on March 13th&lt;/a&gt; carrying with it the removal of trust for Symantec certificates issued prior to June 1st, 2016, with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Additional_Trust_Changes#Symantec&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;exception of certificates issued by a few subordinate CAs that are controlled by Apple and Google&lt;/a&gt;. This change affects all Symantec brands including GeoTrust, RapidSSL, Thawte, and VeriSign. The change is already in effect in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/#nightly&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Firefox Nightly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla telemetry currently shows that a significant number of sites – roughly 1% of the top one million – are still using TLS certificates that are no longer trusted in Firefox 60. While the number of affected sites has been declining steadily, we do not expect every website to be updated prior to the Beta release of Firefox 60. We strongly encourage operators of affected sites to take immediate action to replace these certificates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you attempt to visit a site that is using a TLS certificate that is no longer trusted in Firefox 60, you will encounter the following error:&lt;br/&gt;﻿&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/security/files/2018/03/UntrustedConnection.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/security/files/2018/03/UntrustedConnection.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;874&quot; height=&quot;260&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2305&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/security/files/2018/03/UntrustedConnection.png 874w, https://blog.mozilla.org/security/files/2018/03/UntrustedConnection-252x75.png 252w, https://blog.mozilla.org/security/files/2018/03/UntrustedConnection-768x228.png 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/security/files/2018/03/UntrustedConnection-600x178.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clicking on the “Advanced” button will allow you to bypass the error and reach the site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/security/files/2018/03/Advanced.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/security/files/2018/03/Advanced.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;874&quot; height=&quot;549&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2306&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/security/files/2018/03/Advanced.png 874w, https://blog.mozilla.org/security/files/2018/03/Advanced-252x158.png 252w, https://blog.mozilla.org/security/files/2018/03/Advanced-768x482.png 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/security/files/2018/03/Advanced-600x377.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These changes are expected to be included in the final version of Firefox 60 that is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease/Calendar&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;planned to be release on May 9th, 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Firefox 63, trust will be removed for all Symantec TLS certificates regardless of the date issued (with the exception of certificates issued by Apple and Google subordinate CAs as described above).&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Firefox 62.0 Released</title>
<link>https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/62.0/releasenotes/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/62.0/releasenotes/</guid>
<description>&lt;li id=&quot;note-787694&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox Home (the default New Tab) now allows users to display up to 4 rows of top sites, Pocket stories, and highlights&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;note-787699&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reopen in Container” tab menu option appears for users with Containers that lets them choose to reopen a tab in a different container&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;note-787700&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In advance of removing all trust for Symantec-issued certificates in Firefox 63, a preference was added that allows users to distrust certificates issued by Symantec. To use this preference, go to about:config in the address bar and set the preference &quot;security.pki.distrust_ca_policy&quot; to 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;note-787701&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added FreeBSD support for WebAuthn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;note-787702&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improved graphics rendering for Windows users without accelerated hardware using Parallel-Off-Main-Thread Painting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;note-787684&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support for CSS Shapes, allowing for richer web page layouts. This goes hand in hand with a brand new Shape Path Editor in the CSS inspector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;note-787686&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSS Variable Fonts (OpenType Font Variations) support, which makes it possible to create beautiful typography with a single font file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;note-787693&quot; readability=&quot;-0.80519480519481&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updates for &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.mozilla.org/products/firefox-enterprise&quot;&gt;enterprise environments&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;AutoConfig is sandboxed to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.mozilla.org/kb/customizing-firefox-using-autoconfig&quot;&gt;documented API&lt;/a&gt; by default. You&lt;br/&gt;can disable the sandbox by setting the preference&lt;br/&gt;general.config.sandbox_enabled to false. Our long term plan is to&lt;br/&gt;remove the ability to turn off the sandboxing. If you need to&lt;br/&gt;continue to use more complex AutoConfig scripts, you will need to use&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/organizations/&quot;&gt;Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;note-787688&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added Canadian English (en-CA) locale&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading the NY Times article “&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/07/business/media/katzenberg-streaming-video.html&quot;&gt;Jeffrey Katzenberg Raises $1 Billion for Short-Form Video Venture,&lt;/a&gt;” &lt;/em&gt;I realized it was time for a new startup heuristic: the amount of customer discovery and product-market fit you need to find is inversely proportional to the amount and availability of risk capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while the “first mover advantage” was the rallying cry of the last bubble, today’s is: “Massive capital infusion can own the entire market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire, Ready, Aim&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Katzenberg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Jeff Katzenberg&lt;/a&gt; has a great track record – head of the studio at Paramount, chairman of Disney Studios, co-founder of DreamWorks and now chairman of NewTV. The billion dollars he just raised is on top of the $750 million NewTV’s parent company, WndrCo, has raised for the venture. He just hired &lt;a href=&quot;https://r-login.wordpress.com/remote-login.php?action=auth&amp;amp;host=variety.com&amp;amp;id=43439658&amp;amp;back=https%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2018%2Fdigital%2Fnews%2Fmeg-whitman-tapped-as-ceo-of-jeffrey-katzenbergs-mobile-content-venture-1202674576%2F&amp;amp;h=&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Meg Whitman&lt;/a&gt;. the ex-CEO of HP and eBay, as CEO of NewTV. Their idea is that consumers will want a subscription service for short form entertainment (10-minute programs) for mobile rather than full length movies. (Think YouTube meets Netflix).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an almost $2-billion-dollar bet based on a set of hypotheses. Will consumers want to watch short-form mobile entertainment? Since NewTV won’t be making the content, they will be licensing from and partnering with traditional entertainment producers. Will these third parties produce something people will watch? NewTV will depend on partners like telcos to distribute the content. (Given Verizon just shut down &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go90&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Go90&lt;/a&gt;, its short form content video service, it will be interesting to see if Verizon distributes Katzenberg’s offerings.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But NewTV doesn’t plan on testing these hypotheses. With fewer than 10 employees but almost $2-billion dollars in the bank, they plan on jumping right in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the antithesis of the Lean Startup.  And it may work. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dot Com Boom to Bust&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Most entrepreneurs today don’t remember the Dot-Com bubble of 1995 or the Dot-Com crash that followed in 2000. As a reminder, the Dot Com bubble was a five-year period from August 1995 (the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/netscape-ipo-ignited-the-boom-taught-some-hard-lessons-20058518550&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Netscape IPO&lt;/a&gt;) when there was a massive wave of experiments on the then-new internet, in commerce, entertainment, nascent social media, and search. When Netscape went public, it unleashed a frenzy from the public markets for anything related to the internet and signaled to venture investors that there were massive returns to be made investing in anything internet related. Almost overnight the floodgates opened, and risk capital was available at scale from venture capital investors who rushed their startups toward public offerings. Tech IPO prices exploded and subsequent trading prices rose to dizzying heights as the stock prices became disconnected from the traditional metrics of revenue and profits. Some have labeled this period as &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_exuberance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;irrational exuberance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. But as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.carlotaperez.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Carlota Perez&lt;/a&gt; has so aptly described, all new technology industries go through an eruption and frenzy phase, followed by a crash, then a golden age and maturity. Then the cycle repeats with a new set of technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the stock market was buying “the story and vision” of anything internet, inflated expectations were more important than traditional metrics like customers, growth, revenue, or heaven forbid, profits. Startups wrote business plans, generated expansive 5-year forecasts and executed (hired, spent and built) to the plan. The mantra of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://steveblank.com/2010/10/04/why-pioneers-are-the-ones-with-the-arrows-in-their-backs/&quot;&gt;first mover advantage&lt;/a&gt;,” the idea that winners are the ones who are the first entrants in their market, became the conventional wisdom of investors in Silicon Valley.“ First Movers” didn’t understand customer problems or the product features that solved those problems (what we now call product-market fit). These bubble startups were actually guessing at their business model and did premature and aggressive hype and early company launches and had extremely high burn rates – all predicated on an IPO to raise more cash. To be fair, in the 20&lt;sup&gt;th &lt;/sup&gt;century, there really wasn’t a model for how to build startups other than write plan, raise money, and execute – the bubble was this method, on steroids. And to be honest, VC’s in this bubble really didn’t care. Massive liquidity awaited the first movers to the IPO’s, and that’s how they managed their portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When VC’s realized how eager the public markets were for anything related to the internet, they pushed startups with little revenue and no profits into IPOs as fast as they could. The unprecedented size and scale of VC returns transformed venture capital from a financial asset backwater into full-fledged player in the financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then one day it was over. IPOs dried up. Startups with huge burn rates – building leases, staff, PR and advertising – ran out of money. Most startups born in the bubble died in the bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Rise of the Lean Startup&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;After the crash, venture capital was scarce to non-existent. (Most of the funds that started in the late part of the boom would be underwater). Angel investment, which was small to start with, disappeared, and most corporate VCs shut down. VC’s were no longer insisting that startups spend faster, and “swing for the fences”. In fact, they were screaming at them to dramatically reduce their burn rates. It was a nuclear winter for startup capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of the Lean Startup was built on top of the rubble of the 2000 Dot-Com crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With risk capital at a premium and the public markets closed, startups and their investors now needed a methodology to preserve capital and survive long enough to generate revenue and profits. And to do that they needed a different method than just “build it and they will come.” They needed to be sure that what they were building was what customers wanted and needed. And if their initial guesses were wrong, they needed a process that would permit them to change early on in the product development process when the cost of changes was small – the famed “pivot”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lean started from the observation that &lt;em&gt;you cannot ask a question that you have no words for&lt;/em&gt;. At the time we had no language to describe that startups were not smaller versions of large companies; the first insight was that large companies &lt;em&gt;executed &lt;/em&gt;known business models, while startups &lt;em&gt;searched for them.&lt;/em&gt; Yet while we had plenty of language and tools for execution, we had none for search.  So we (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0989200507/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0989200507&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=wwwsteveblank-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Blank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307887898/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwsteveblank-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=217145&amp;amp;creative=399373&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0307887898&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;ies, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470876417?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwsteveblank-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0470876417&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Osterwalder&lt;/a&gt;) built the tools and created a new language for innovation and modern entrepreneurship. It helped that in the nuclear winter that followed the crash, 2001 – 2004, startups and VCs were extremely risk averse and amenable to new ideas that reduced risk. (This same &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2008/10/10/sequoia-capitals-56-slide-powerpoint-presentation-of-doom/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;risk averse, conserve the cash, VC mindset&lt;/a&gt; would return after the 2008 meltdown of the housing market.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As described in the HBR article “&lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Why the Lean Startup Changes Everything&lt;/a&gt;,” we developed Lean as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://steveblank.com/2010/10/25/entrepreneurship-as-a-science-%E2%80%93-the-business-modelcustomer-development-stack/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;business model / customer development / agile development solution stack&lt;/a&gt; where entrepreneurs first map their hypotheses about their business model and then test these hypotheses with customers in the field (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0989200507/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0989200507&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=wwwsteveblank-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;customer development&lt;/a&gt;) and use an iterative and incremental development methodology (agile development) to build the product. This allowed startups to build Minimal Viable Products (MVPs) – incremental and iterative prototypes – and put them in front of a large number of customers to get immediate feedback. When founders discovered their assumptions were wrong, as they inevitably did, the result wasn’t a crisis; it was a learning event called &lt;a href=&quot;https://steveblank.com/2010/04/12/why-startups-are-agile-and-opportunistic-%E2%80%93-pivoting-the-business-model/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a pivot&lt;/a&gt;— and an opportunity to change the business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every startup is in a race against time. It has to find product-market fit before running out of cash. Lean makes sense when capital is scarce and when you need to keep burn rates low. Lean was designed to &lt;em&gt;inform the founders’ vision while they operated frugally at speed. It was not built as a focus group for consensus for those without deep convictions&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result? Startups now had tools that sped up the search for customers, ensured that what was being built met customer needs, reduced time to market and slashed the cost of development&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carpe Diem – Seize the Cash&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Today, memories of frugal VC’s and tight capital markets have faded, and the structure of risk capital is radically different. The explosion of seed funding means tens of thousands of companies that previously languished in their basement are getting funding, likely two orders of magnitude more than received Series A funding during the Dot-Com bubble. As mobile devices offer a platform of several billion eyeballs, potential customers which were previously small niche markets now include everyone on the planet. And enterprise customers in a race to reconfigure strategies, channels, and offerings to deal with disruption provide a willing market for startup tools and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this is driven by corporate funds, sovereign funds and even VC funds with capital pools of tens of billions of dollars dwarfing any of the dollars in the first Dot Com bubble – and all looking for the next Tesla, Uber, Airbnb, or Alibaba. What matters to investors now is to drive startup valuations into &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/02/welcome-to-the-unicorn-club/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;unicorn territory&lt;/a&gt; (valued at $1 billion or more) via rapid growth – usually users, revenue, engagements but almost never profits. As valuations have long passed the peak of the 2000 Internet bubble, VC’s and founders who previously had to wait until they sold their company or took it public to make money no longer have to wait. They can now sell part of their investment when they raise the next round. And if the company does go public, the valuations are at least 10x of the last bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With capital chasing the best deals, and hundreds of millions of dollars pouring into some startups, most funds now scoff at the idea of Lean. Rather than the &lt;em&gt;“first mover advantage”&lt;/em&gt; of the last bubble&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; today’s theory is that&lt;em&gt; “massive capital infusion owns the entire market.”&lt;/em&gt; And Lean for startups seems like some quaint notion of a bygone era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that explains why investors are willing to bet on someone with a successful track record like Katzenberg who has a vision of disrupting an entire industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, Lean was an answer to a specific startup problem at a specific time, &lt;em&gt;one that most entrepreneurs still face and which ebbs and flows depending on capital markets&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a response to scarce capital, and when that constraint is loosened, it’s worth considering whether other approaches are superior. With enough cash in the bank, Katzenberg can afford to create content, sign distribution deals, and see if consumers watch. If not, he still has the option to pivot. And if he’s right, the payoff will be huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One More Thing…&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Well-funded startups often have more capital for R&amp;amp;D than the incumbent companies they’re disrupting. Companies struggle to compete while reconfiguring legacy distribution channels, pricing models and supply chains. And government agencies find themselves being disrupted by adversaries unencumbered by legacy systems, policies and history.  Both companies and government agencies struggle with how to deliver innovation at speed. Ironically, for this new audience that makes the next generation of Lean – &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2017/09/what-your-innovation-process-should-look-like&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Innovation Pipeline&lt;/a&gt; – more relevant than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lessons Learned:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When capital for startups is readily available at scale, it makes more sense to go big, fast and make mistakes than it does to search for product/market fit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The amount of customer discovery and product-market fit you need to do is inversely proportional to the amount and availability of risk capital.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still, unless your startup has access to large pools of capital or have a brand name like Katzenberg, Lean still makes sense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lean is now essential for companies and government agencies to deliver innovation at speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Lean Startup isn’t dead. For companies and government the next generation of Lean – &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2017/09/what-your-innovation-process-should-look-like&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Innovation Pipeline&lt;/a&gt; – is more relevant than ever.&lt;/li&gt;

<title>The #1 Office Perk? Natural Light</title>
<link>https://hbr.org/2018/09/the-1-office-perk-natural-light</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://hbr.org/2018/09/the-1-office-perk-natural-light</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;43&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;text-gray-light mbn mt-large2&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news headlines about what perks or elements of office design make for a great employee experience seem to be dominated by fads — think treadmill desks, nap pods, and “bring your dog to work day” for starters. But in a recent poll of 1,614 North American employees, access to natural light and views of the outdoors was the number one attribute of the workplace environment outranking stalwarts like onsite cafeterias, fitness centers, and premium perks including on-site childcare. There are wellness and productivity implications, too: academic research has found that workers with natural daylight in their office environments reported a 51% drop in the incidence of eyestrain, a 63% drop in the incidence of headaches and a 56% reduction in drowsiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;153.37021608956&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mbn pbn&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-211148&quot; src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/08/aug18_31_456227-unsplash.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2018/08/aug18_31_456227-unsplash-300x169.jpg 300w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/08/aug18_31_456227-unsplash-768x432.jpg 768w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/08/aug18_31_456227-unsplash-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/08/aug18_31_456227-unsplash-500x281.jpg 500w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/08/aug18_31_456227-unsplash-383x215.jpg 383w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/08/aug18_31_456227-unsplash-383x215.jpg 383w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/08/aug18_31_456227-unsplash-500x281.jpg 500w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/08/aug18_31_456227-unsplash-700x394.jpg 700w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/08/aug18_31_456227-unsplash-850x478.jpg 850w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/08/aug18_31_456227-unsplash-1200x675.jpg 1200w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/08/aug18_31_456227-unsplash.jpg 1200w&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;675&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 48em) 55.7291667vw, 97.3924381vw&quot;/&gt; Wong/Unsplash&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news headlines about what perks or elements of office design make for a great employee experience seem to be dominated by fads — think treadmill desks, nap pods, and “bring your dog to work day” for starters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a new survey by my HR advisory firm &lt;a href=&quot;http://futureworkplace.com/&quot;&gt;Future Workplace&lt;/a&gt; called “The Employee Experience” reveals the reality is that employees crave something far more fundamental and essential to human needs. In a research poll of 1,614 North American employees, we found that access to natural light and views of the outdoors are the number one attribute of the workplace environment, outranking stalwarts like onsite cafeterias, fitness centers, and premium perks including on-site childcare (&lt;a href=&quot;https://theoutline.com/post/1610/the-fortune-100-companies-that-offer-on-site-day-care-to-employees?zd=1&amp;amp;zi=ekcr2ymz&quot;&gt;only 4-8% of FORTUNE 100 companies offer on-site child care&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also found that the absence of natural light and outdoor views hurts the employee experience.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Over a third of employees feel that they don’t get enough natural light in their workspace. 47% of employees admit they feel tired or very tired from the absence of natural light or a window at their office, and 43% report feeling gloomy because of the lack of light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings support a larger trend of the growing importance of employee wellbeing. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.gallup.com/reports/199961/7.aspx&quot;&gt;Gallup’s most recent iteration of the State of the American Workplace&lt;/a&gt;, more than half of employees report better overall well-being as “very important” to them.  In the same survey, work-life balance and overall well-being were determined to be the second most important factor when choosing to work for an organization. When employees are fulfilled in all aspects of their well-being, this leads to increased employee engagement and increases individual performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desire for workplaces infused with daylight and views may also be due to our increased usage of mobile devices. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/how-much-time-do-people-spend-on-their-mobile-phones-in-2017-e5f90a0b10a6&quot;&gt;eMarketer Mobile Research study&lt;/a&gt; reports that American adults over the age of 18 spend about four hours on their mobile devices every day. In “The Employee Experience” study, we found that 73% of employees surveyed agree that the longer they use their technology devices, the more they desire a visual break such as taking a walk or looking through unobstructed windows to an outside view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research by Cornell University Professor Dr. Alan Hedge reinforces the connection of natural light and employee wellbeing. Dr. Hedge’s recent research &lt;a href=&quot;https://medwinpublishers.com/EOIJ/EOIJ16000166.pdf&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found optimization of natural light in an office significantly improves health and wellness among workers. In fact, this research revealed that workers in daylight office environments reported a 51% drop in the incidence of eyestrain, a 63% drop in the incidence of headaches and a 56% reduction in drowsiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental health benefits of access to natural light are causing some firms to re-imagine their workspace and tout this as a recruiting tool. A great example of this is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattlespheres.com/&quot;&gt;The Spheres&lt;/a&gt;, an Amazon workspace in downtown Seattle that’s also a curated jungle with over 40,000 plants. Amazon’s Spheres relies on the premise that natural light, plant life, and healthy activities such as walking reduce employee stress and improve job satisfaction more so than a standard office building. (Note that in contrast to many of its peers, Amazon has chosen to invest in Spheres rather than other commonly touted office perks such as free lunches and snacks.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too often, organizations design workspaces for executives with large windows while lower level employees do not have access to light. But it doesn’t have to be this way. &lt;a href=&quot;https://press.airbnb.com/about-us/&quot;&gt;Airbnb&lt;/a&gt; has pushed the limits of designing its customer call center operation in Portland, Oregon. Rather than windowless work stations commonly found in call centers, the Airbnb Call Center is designed to be an open space with access to natural light and views of the surroundings while replacing desks and phones with long couches, standing desks and wireless technology. The benefits of these elements is is well recognized. In fact, some European Union countries mandate employee proximity to windows as part of their national building code! This is because they realize that an absence of natural light hurts overall employee experience, up and down the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural light isn’t the only important aspect of workplace wellness, of course. For example, one frequently cited &lt;a href=&quot;https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/27662232/4892924.pdf?sequence=1&quot;&gt;Harvard study&lt;/a&gt; showed that improving air quality caused mental cognition to soar. But the Future Workplace Employee Experience Study found 78% of employees say access to natural light and views improves their wellbeing and 70% report improved work performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion that the creation of the workplace environment is solely a real estate concern is an outdated concept. Today, employers recognize that the workplace environment is now part of the overall employee experience equation and a key lever to attract, engage, and retain top talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, CEOs are starting to focus on how the workspace can lead to improved productivity. Overstock’s 230,000-square-foot office in Salt Lake City, UT features a panoramic view of scenic Salt Lake Valley. Rather than obstruct this view with blinds, Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne wanted a solution that kept his employees connected with the view while working. So, Overstock installed 30,000 square feet of smart windows which automatically adjust to optimize natural daylight, allowing workers to shield glare from computer screens and creating a more creative work environment. With an annual payroll of over $100 million, even a 2% increase in productivity &lt;a href=&quot;https://viewglass.com/portfolio/overstock.com/&quot;&gt;translates to a savings of $2 million.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now think about your organization. Workers spend on average &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/01/120113210203.htm&quot;&gt;5 hours and 42 minutes&lt;/a&gt; at their desk each day. Having access to natural light can have a bottom-line impact on your employees’ work performance, wellbeing and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can you think differently about the impact of natural light in your organization? Here are three suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See the workspace through the lens of your employees. &lt;/strong&gt;Today, business leaders are aware of the power of creating an employee experience to mirror their company’s best customer experience. Tools such as design thinking and employee journey mapping are now often used to understand the moments that matter to employees. In fact, many companies are creating a new job role, Head of Employee Experience, to work closely with heads of Real Estate and IT to design and monitor how the employee experience is woven into the fabric of the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to your employees to understand what type of workplace environment they want. &lt;/strong&gt;Companies routinely conduct employee surveys to gather feedback on a number of factors such as their culture, performance management and investment in learning and development. Now, they also need to include survey questions on the expectations employees have for the type of workspace they work in and how this impacts their overall wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider creating an optimal workspace for all employees — both executives and front-line workers. &lt;/strong&gt;The notion that organizations create optimal workspaces for executives only is no longer the case. Companies like Airbnb and Overstock recognize the importance of the workspace  for all employees — from the executive team members to the front-line customer call center operators. As employee experience becomes increasingly important to attract, engage and retain top talent, the workspace is now recognized as an integral part of this experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As companies increasingly look to empower their employees to work better and be healthier, it is clear that placing them in office spaces with the optimal amount of natural light should be one of their first considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How to Make a Big Decision</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/01/opinion/sunday/how-make-big-decision.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/01/opinion/sunday/how-make-big-decision.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The upshot is clear: If you find yourself mapping a “whether or not” question, looking at a simple fork in the road, you’re almost always better off turning it into a “which one” question that gives you more available paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;What’s the best way to expand your pool of options? Researchers suggest that if possible, you diversify the group of people who are helping make the decision. About a decade ago, the social psychologist Samuel Sommers conducted a series of mock trials in which a jury debated and evaluated evidence from a sexual assault case. Some of the juries were entirely white, while other juries were more diverse in their racial makeup. By almost every important metric, the racially mixed juries performed better at their task. They considered more potential interpretations of the evidence, remembered information about the case more accurately and engaged in the deliberation process with more rigor and persistence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Homogeneous groups — whether they are united by ethnic background, gender or some other commonality like politics — tend to come to decisions too quickly. They settle early on a most-likely scenario and don’t question their assumptions, since everyone at the table seems to agree with the broad outline of the interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;A 2008 study led by the management professor Katherine Phillips using a similar investigative structure revealed an additional, seemingly counterintuitive finding: While the more diverse groups were better at reaching the truth, they were also far less confident in the decisions they made. They were both more likely to be right and, at the same time, more open to the idea that they might be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Once you have your alternatives, how are you supposed to assess them? One approach, known as scenario planning, developed by a handful of management consultants in the 1970s, involves imagining three different future environments for each alternative: Concoct one story where things get better, one where they get worse, and one where they get weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Storytelling is something we instinctively do anytime we are contemplating a big decision. If you’re thinking of leaving the city and moving to the suburbs, you tell a story of family hikes through the trails behind your house, and better public schools, and a garden that you can tend in your backyard. The difference with formal scenario planning is twofold: First, we rarely take the time to do a deep analysis of all the forces that shape that story; and second, we rarely bother to construct multiple stories. How does the story unfold if your children don’t like their new classmates, or if one part of the family loves the new lifestyle but the other is homesick for the old friends and vitality of city life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The psychologist Gary Klein has developed a variation on this technique. He calls it a “premortem.” As the name suggests, the approach is a twist on the medical procedure of post-mortem analysis. In a post-mortem, the subject is dead, and the coroner’s job is to figure out the cause of death. In a premortem, the sequence is reversed: “Our exercise,” Dr. Klein explains, “is to ask planners to imagine that it is months into the future and that their plan has been carried out. And it has failed. That is all they know; they have to explain why they think it failed.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>‘Five Eyes’ Nations Quietly Demand Government Access to Encrypted Data</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/us/politics/government-access-encrypted-data.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/us/politics/government-access-encrypted-data.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;46.341395991707&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;39.583275742916&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;WASHINGTON — The Trump administration and its closest intelligence partners have quietly warned technology firms that they will demand “lawful access” to all encrypted emails, text messages and voice communications, threatening to compel compliance if the private companies refuse to voluntarily provide the information to the governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about/national-security/five-country-ministerial-2018/access-evidence-encryption&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;threat was issued&lt;/a&gt; last week by the United States, Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, the so-called Five Eyes nations that broadly share intelligence. Collectively, they have been frustrated by the spread of encrypted apps on cellphones and the ability to send encrypted messages through social media and, most prominently, on Apple’s iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The issue flared repeatedly during the Obama administration, with the former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, warning that law enforcement officials were “going dark” as nefarious actors relied on encrypted channels to discuss or plan criminal activity or terrorist plots. But the Trump administration &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/24/us/politics/unlock-phones-encryption.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;has said little about the subject&lt;/a&gt;, even after the meeting in Australia where the demand was issued in a joint statement by the five nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Should governments continue to encounter impediments to lawful access to information necessary to aid the protection of the citizens of our countries,” the joint statement said, “we may pursue technological, enforcement, legislative or other measures to achieve lawful access solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;45&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;On Wednesday, leaders from two major social media firms, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook and Jack Dorsey of Twitter, will testify at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on curbing election interference by Russia and other powers. The social networks are also expected to answer Republican charges that their firms, and others, use their platforms to emphasize news media sources with liberal bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But the new demands by the five nations threaten to rekindle a debate that seized Washington and Silicon Valley after Apple gradually began encrypting more data on its phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;At the core of the dispute is whether Apple, Facebook, Google and others should be compelled to provide a “back door” to their products that would allow government investigators to gain access to all communications, with a legal order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;It is far from clear that Congress is ready to take on the technology companies on this issue, especially because more companies and citizens are turning to encryption to protect sensitive conversations and financial transfers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Ordinary Americans — including President Trump’s former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen — are also increasingly using encrypted apps to conduct delicate conversations to prevent monitoring by the government or others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;51.773180751174&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;50.321596244131&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;On Tuesday, staff members of key congressional committees said they had received no briefings on the new accord from Australia, and questioned how they could construct rules that provided access to all encrypted communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;One Senate staff member said the memo was unenforceable in its current form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook and Google were similarly surprised, and questioned what sort of measures would be put into place with companies that did not comply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook did not comment directly on the memo, but referred questions back to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/05/end-to-end-encryption/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a public blog&lt;/a&gt; it published in May explaining the company’s policies on encryption, and why it did not want to create back doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Cybersecurity experts have repeatedly proven that it’s impossible to create any back door that couldn’t be discovered — and exploited — by bad actors,” Facebook said in the blog post. “It’s why weakening any part of encryption weakens the whole security ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The debate was fueled in part by Apple’s refusal to unlock an iPhone used by one of the attackers in a 2015 shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., as demanded by the F.B.I. A year earlier, Mr. Comey had &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/27/technology/iphone-locks-out-the-nsa-signaling-a-post-snowden-era-.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;cited “concerns” about encryption apps&lt;/a&gt; that he described as “companies marketing something expressly to allow people to hold themselves beyond the law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In response, Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, contended that once phones or messaging systems were designed to allow legal access, hackers from Russia, China, Iran, North Korea and elsewhere would use the breach to pry their way in, destroying technology devised to protect privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“It’s our job to provide you with the tools to lock up your stuff,” Mr. Cook said in an interview in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;41.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;28&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;He tried, unsuccessfully, to convince former President Barack Obama that there was no safe technological way to create back doors; Apple deliberately does not retain the keys to unlock those communications, so they can tell investigators, or the courts, that they are unable to comply with demands for access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But Mr. Obama left office without resolving the issue of the government’s ability to compel access. Both Mr. Trump and his rival in the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton, sided with law enforcement authorities on giving access to the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;One Facebook official, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the press, said that the memo from Australia had no teeth, and was part of an escalating war between government officials and Silicon Valley over access to people’s private data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;article-content &quot;&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Theranos Inc., the blood-testing company accused of perpetrating Silicon Valley’s biggest fraud, will soon cease to exist.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;In the wake of a high-profile scandal, the company will formally dissolve, according to an &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/Theranos_Stockholders_Letter_2018.pdf?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;email to shareholders&lt;/a&gt;. Theranos will seek to pay unsecured creditors its remaining cash in coming months, the email said.&lt;/p&gt;




      




      &lt;div class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move comes after federal prosecutors &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-files-criminal-charges-against-theranoss-elizabeth-holmes-ramesh-balwani-1529096005?&amp;amp;mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;filed criminal charges&lt;/a&gt; against Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes and the blood-testing company’s former No. 2 executive, alleging that they defrauded investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars and defrauded doctors and patients. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;The executives have denied the charges and face a coming criminal trial.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt; 




      &lt;p&gt;The dissolution process was precipitated by the fact that Theranos breached a covenant governing a $65 million loan it received from Fortress Investment Group last year. Under the loan terms, Fortress was entitled to foreclose upon the company’s assets if its cash fell beneath a certain threshold.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;In the email to shareholders, sent Tuesday, Theranos General Counsel and Chief Executive Officer David Taylor said the company is trying to negotiate a settlement with Fortress that would give the New York private-equity firm ownership of the company’s patents but leave its remaining cash—estimated at about $5 million—for distribution to other unsecured creditors.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Under a liquidation process known as “an assignment for the benefit of creditors,” getting that remaining cash to the unsecured creditors could take six to 12 months, Mr. Taylor said in the email. Most of Theranos’s two-dozen remaining employees worked their last day on Friday, Aug. 31. Only Mr. Taylor and a handful of support staff remain on the payroll for a few more days.&lt;/p&gt;






       




      &lt;p&gt;The action followed a failed bid to sell the company. Over four months, investment bank Jefferies Group LLC reached out on Theranos’s behalf to more than 80 potential buyers, and executed nondisclosure agreements with 17 of those parties, the email said, adding: “We assisted those parties with diligence and had numerous follow-on conversations.”&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;The big-name investors who poured money into Theranos will get nothing. All told, investors in Theranos have lost nearly $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Theranos’s founder and chairman, Ms. Holmes, and her ex-boyfriend, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani were indicted on nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in June. Mr. Balwani was Theranos’s president and chief operating officer until he retired from the company in May 2016. If convicted, they each face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000, plus restitution to those found to have been defrauded, on each count.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;The indictments followed months of reporting by The Wall Street Journal that raised questions about the company’s technology and practices. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Ms. Holmes sought to disrupt the blood-testing business. At the height of her fame, the Stanford University dropout claimed to have invented groundbreaking new technology that could run the full range of laboratory tests on just a drop or two of blood pricked from a finger.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;On the strength of her claims, Theranos rolled out its vaunted finger-stick blood tests in Walgreens stores in California and Arizona and rocketed to a valuation of more than $9 billion, making Ms. Holmes a billionaire and media celebrity. Her bold talk and black turtlenecks drew comparisons to Steve Jobs. The pharmacy chain has said it was misled by Theranos about its technology and prospects.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;But as the Journal revealed in a series of articles beginning in October 2015, Theranos’s blood-testing device was unreliable and the company used it for just a fraction of the more than 240 tests it offered to consumers. Behind the scenes, it performed the vast majority of the tests with commercial analyzers purchased from other companies.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Theranos become a symbol of the excesses of the current technology boom. Its failure was dramatic and painful for many. A biochemist who worked at Theranos for eight years committed suicide in 2013 after becoming distraught by its culture of fear and secrecy and its lack of progress with its technology, according to his widow. Tyler Shultz, a grandson of former Secretary of State George Shultz and the first employee to blow the whistle to a state regulator about what he saw as troubling practices, became estranged from his grandfather, a Theranos director.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;The roster of Theranos investors—most of whom poured money into the company after its commercial rollout in Walgreens stores in late 2013—included the Waltons, heirs to

      the Journal’s parent company. Each invested $100 million or more in Theranos—investments that are now worthless.&lt;/p&gt;

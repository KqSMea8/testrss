                    The study found that users had to turn off another setting in order to disable location being recorded
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;Google records users' locations even when they have asked it not to, a report from the Associated Press has suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue could affect up to two billion Android and Apple devices which use Google for maps or search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, verified by researchers at Princeton University, has angered US law-makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google said in response that it provides clear descriptions of its tools and how to turn them off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that users' whereabouts are recorded even when location history has been disabled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;Google stores a snapshot of where you are when you open the Maps app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt; Automatic weather updates on Android phones pinpoint roughly where a user is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;Searches that have nothing to do with location pinpoint precise longitude and latitude of users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;'Pretty sneaky'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the effect of these location markers, AP created a visual map showing the movements of Princeton researcher Gunes Acar who was using an Android phone with location history turned off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The map showed his train commute around New York as well as visits to The High Line park, Chelsea Market, Hell's Kitchen, Central Park and Harlem. It also revealed his home address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To stop Google saving these location markers, users have to turn off another setting called Web and App Activity, which is enabled by default and which does not mention location data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disabling this prevents Google storing information generated by searches and other activities which can limit the effectiveness of its digital assistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You would think that telling Google that you didn't want your location to be tracked by disabling an option called &quot;Location History&quot; would stop the internet giant from storing data about your location,&quot;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.grahamcluley.com/pausing-google-location-history-doesnt-stop-your-location-data-from-being-collected-and-stored/&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;writes security researcher Graham Cluley on his blog.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It seems pretty sneaky to me that Google continues to store location data, unless you both disable &quot;Location history&quot; and &quot;Web &amp;amp; App Activity.&quot;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, Google told AP: &quot;There are a number of different ways that Google may use location to improve people's experience, including: Location History, Web and App Activity, and through device-level Location Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We provide clear descriptions of these tools, and robust controls so people can turn them on or off, and delete their histories at any time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Corporate practices&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following its research, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apnews.com/b031ee35d4534f548e43b7575f4ab494/How-to-find-and-delete-where-Google-knows-you've-been&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;AP created a guide&lt;/a&gt; to show users how to delete location data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented with the evidence of the AP study, Democratic senator Mark Warner accused technology companies of having &quot;corporate practices that diverge wildly from the totally reasonable expectation of their users&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democratic congressman Frank Pallone called for &quot;comprehensive consumer privacy and data security legislation&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, a spokesman for the Information Commissioner's Office told the BBC: &quot;Under the GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018, organisations have a legal duty to be open, transparent and fair with the public about how their personal data is used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Anybody who has concerns about how an organisation is handling their personal information can contact the ICO.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology firms are under fire for not being clear about privacy settings and how to use them. In June, a report from the Norwegian Consumer Council found evidence that privacy-friendly options are hidden away or obscured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Location-based advertising offers big opportunities to marketers. According to research firm BIA/Kelsey, US brands are poised to spend up to $20.6bn (Â£16.3bn) on targeted mobile ads in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2014, Google has let advertisers track the effectiveness of online adverts with a feature based on footfall data, which relies on location history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Atlantia, the toll road operator which runs much of the country's motorways, fell 6.3% after news of the collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French President Emmanuel Macron has tweeted a message of sympathy to the people of Italy, writing in both Italian and French. He said France was ready to offer any necessary aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;How did the structure collapse?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It fell around 11:30 local time (09:30 GMT) during heavy rain. Police reported a violent cloudburst. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was just after 11:30 when we saw lightning strike the bridge,&quot; eyewitness Pietro M all'Asa was quoted as saying by Italy's Ansa news agency. &quot;And we saw the bridge going down.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another witness, unnamed, recalled: &quot;We heard an incredible roar and first we thought it was thunder very close by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We live about 5km [three miles] from the bridge but we heard a crazy bang... We were very scared... Traffic went completely haywire and the city was paralysed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;One image posted by the regional emergency services shows a truck perched at the end of the surviving bridge section immediately before the drop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;What do we know of the victims?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giving the death toll of 22, Deputy Transport Minister Edoardo Rixi said the number was likely to rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A child was among the dead and at least 13 more people were injured, said the head of the civil defence agency, Angelo Borrelli. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full horror of the collapse could be seen in aerial video of the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;How important is the bridge?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Morandi Bridge, built in the 1960s, stands on the A10 toll motorway, which serves the Italian Riviera and southern coast of France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The missing section was dozens of metres in length, and ran across the span of the Polcevera river.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Were there any concerns about the bridge? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restructuring work on the bridge was carried out in 2016, Reuters news agency reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highway operator said work to shore up its foundation was being carried out at the time of the collapse, and the bridge was constantly monitored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's not acceptable that such an important bridge... was not built to avoid this kind of collapse,&quot; Mr Rixi was quoted as saying by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Italy's recently installed government has pledged to increase public investment in infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country spent more than â¬14bn (Â£12.5bn; $16bn) on its roads in 2006 but that had dropped to less than â¬4bn by 2010, according to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The figures cover spending on new transport construction and the improvement of the existing networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spending started to increase in 2013, when total spend was less than Spain, Germany, France and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you witness the collapse of the bridge?

<description>&lt;p&gt;I've deleted the post because some of you are [insert expletive]. The client I do work for is not doing anything illegal. There's no money laundering going on. It's a more legit business than some big-chain stores I shop at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To those of you spreading the &quot;you're admitting to fraud&quot; comments, you're the reason we can't have nice things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To those of you that supported the article, and were generally appreciative to read this, I want to thank you so much. You gave me a reason to want to continue writing more, but since others can't play nice, I won't be doing any other posts.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;August 13, 2018 â Matt Chapman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Intro&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This'll be my first blog post on the internet, ever. Hopefully it's interesting and accurate. Please point out any mistakes if you see any!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, I did some work in trying to find some hotspot areas for parking tickets to see if a bit of data munging could reduce those area's parking tickets. In the end, I only really got one cleaned up, but it was &lt;em&gt;one of&lt;/em&gt; the most-ticketed spots in all of Chicago and led to about a 50% reduction in parking tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a bit of that story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting the data through FOIA:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system Chicago uses to store its parking tickets is called CANVAS. It's short for &quot;City of Chicago Violation, Noticing and Adjudication Business Process And System Support&quot; [sic] and managed by IBM. Its most recent contract started in 2012, expires in 2022, and has a pricetag of over $190 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of Chicago's contracts and their Requests For Procurement (RFP) PDFs are published online. In CANVAS's contracts it gives a fair amount of info on CANVAS's backend infrastructure, including the fact that it uses Oracle 10g. In other words, a FOIA request can be fulfilled by IBM running some simple SQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/dps/ContractAdministration/Specs/2011/Spec92488II.pdf&quot;&gt;CANVAS Technical Spec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://data.cityofchicago.org/Administration-Finance/CANVAS/sbf2-65yk/data&quot;&gt;CANVAS Contract&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ecm.cityofchicago.org/eSMARTContracts/service/DPSWebDocumentViewer?id={C8B55BB4-16F1-4941-B140-CAEA322CFFCD}&amp;amp;osName=eContentContracts&amp;amp;el=0&amp;amp;image=image&quot;&gt;CANVAS Request For Procurement (RFP) and Contract&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that information at hand, and a couple failed FOIA requests later, I sent this request to get the parking ticket data from Jan 1, 2009 to Mar 10, 2016:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Please provide to me all possible information on all parking tickets between 2009 and the present day. This should include any information related to the car (make, etc), license plate, ticket, ticketer, ticket reason(s), financial information (paid, etc), court information (contested, etc), situational (eg, time, location), and photos/videos. Ideally, this should also include any relevant ticket-related information stored within CANVAS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[...]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This information will be used for data analysis for research.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks in advance,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matt Chapman&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a month later, a guy named Carl (in a fancy suit), handed me a CD with some &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; messy data in a semicolon delimited file named &lt;code&gt;A50462_TcktsIssdSince2009.txt&lt;/code&gt;. The file had info on 17,806,818 parking tickets and spans from Jan 1, 2009 to Mar 10, 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data itself looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;head -5 A50462_TcktsIssdSince2009.txt

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Some things to note about the data:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The file is semicolon delimited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each address is hand typed on a handheld device, often with gloves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are &lt;em&gt;millions&lt;/em&gt; of typos in the address column. Including over 50,000 semicolons!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no lat/lon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;What that amounts to is an extremely, extremely messy and unpredictable dataset that's incredibly to difficult to accurately map to lat/lon, which is needed for any sort of comprehensive GIS analysis. There are a bunch of geocoder services that can help out here, but most of them have about a 50% accuracy rate. That said, with the help of a bit of scrubbing, that number can be boosted to closer to 90%. Another post for another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hereâs a sample list of Lake Shore Drive typos:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Laks Shore Dr
Lawkeshore Dr West
Lkaeshore Dr
Lkae Shore Dr
Lkae Shore Drive
Lkaeshore Dr West
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Original Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was particularly interested in finding areas that had hotspot areas that stood out. A lot of my time was spent just throwing hacky code at the problem and eventually wrote out two series of (hacky) commands that led to identifying a potentially fixable spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, the work and analysis I was doing was with a combination of unix commands and gnuplot. Since then, I've migrated my code to python + matplotlib + SQL. But, for the sake of this blog, I wanted to show the original analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get count of tickets at addresses and ignoring first two digits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ mawk -F';' '{print $7}' all_tickets.orig.txt
    | sed -r 's/^([0-9]*)[0-9][0-9] (.*)/\100 \2/'
    | sed -r 's/ (BLVD|ST|AV|AVE|RD)$//'
    | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

  79320 1900 W OGDEN
  &lt;strong&gt;60059 1100 N STATE&lt;/strong&gt;
  50594 100 N WABASH
  44503 1400 N MILWAUKEE
  43121 1500 N MILWAUKEE
  43030 2800 N BROADWAY
  42294 2100 S ARCHER
  42116 1900 W HARRISON
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get count of tickets, by ticket type, at specific addresses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ mawk -F';' '{print $9,$7}' A50462_TcktsIssdSince2009.txt
    | sed -r 's/ (BLVD|ST|AV|AVE|RD)$//'
    | sort --parallel=4 | uniq -c | sort -nr

12510 EXPIRED PLATES OR TEMPORARY REGISTRATION 5050 W 55TH
 9636 PARKING/STANDING PROHIBITED ANYTIME 835 N MICHIGAN
 8943 EXPIRED PLATES OR TEMPORARY REGISTRATION 1 W PARKING LOT A
 6168 EXPIRED PLATES OR TEMPORARY REGISTRATION 1 W PARKING LOT E
 5938 PARKING/STANDING PROHIBITED ANYTIME 500 W MADISON
 &lt;strong&gt;5663 PARK OR STAND IN BUS/TAXI/CARRIAGE STAND 1166 N STATE&lt;/strong&gt;
 5527 EXPIRED METER OR OVERSTAY 5230 S LAKE PARK
 4174 PARKING/STANDING PROHIBITED ANYTIME 1901 W HARRISON
 4137 REAR AND FRONT PLATE REQUIRED 1 W PARKING LOT A
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both bits of code roughly show that there's something going on at 1100N state street, and 1166 N State St looks particularly suspicious..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, have a look at the original set of signs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mchap.io/assets/2016signs.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things going on that make this spot confusing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a taxi stand from 7pm to 5am for three carsâ lengths. Parking in a taxi stand is a $100 ticket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When this spot isnât a taxi stand, itâs metered parking â for a parking meter beyond an alleyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mchap.io/assets/parkingreceipt.jpg&quot;&gt;Itâs possible to pay for parking here after 7pm&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it look like parking is acceptable â especially with the âParkChicagoâ sign floating there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confusion creates more confusion â if one car parks there, then more cars follow. Cha-ching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Contacting the 2nd Ward&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that in mind, I contacted the second wardâs aldermanâs office on April 12 explaining this, and got back this response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Hello Matt,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[â¦]The signs and the ordinance are currently being investigated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the interim, I highly recommend that you do not park there to avoid any further tickets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;LisaÂ Ryan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alderman Brian Hopkins - 2ndÂ Ward&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Fix&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 1/11/17 I received this email from Lisa:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Matt,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don't know if you noticed the additionalÂ signage installedÂ on State Street at the 3 Taxi Stand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This should elevate [sic] any further confusion of vehicle parking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you for your patience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lisa Ryan&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, two new signs were added!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mchap.io/assets/new_signs.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new taxi stand sign sets a boundary for a previously unbounded taxi stand. The No Parking sign explicitly makes it clear that parking here during taxi stand hours is a fineable offense. Neat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there's this guy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mchap.io/assets/thisguy.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently decided to look at the number of tickets at that spot. Armed with a new set of data from another FOIA request, I did some analysis with python, pandas, and SQL. What I found is that the addition of a new sign effectively led to a 50% reduction in parking tickets between 1150 and 1200 N State St. Adding it all up, that's about 400 tickets fewer in 2017 and 200 so far in 2018 compared to 2016. All in all, that's about $60,000 worth in parking tickets!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drop in slope to about 50% matches perfectly with Lisaâs email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mchap.io/assets/plot_fullcumsum.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then comparing 2016 to 2017:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mchap.io/assets/plot_splitbyyear.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What's next?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, the number of parking tickets is going up in Chicago, and this work shows that &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; can be done, even if small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mchap.io/assets/plot_fulldatasetcumsum.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work is only on one small section of road, but I'm convinced that similar work can be on a systematic scale. It's mostly just a matter of digging through data and working directly with each ward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The later analysis done here was also only done on the most recent dataset that the Department of Revenue they gave me. The two datasets have a different set of columns, so the two datasets need to be combined still. I hope to accomplish that soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was sixteen, I read ten books a week: E.âE. Cummings, William Faulkner, Henry James, Hart Crane, John Steinbeck. I thought I progressed in literature by reading faster and fasterâbut reading more is reading less. I learned to slow down. Thirty years later, in New Hampshire with Jane, I made a living by freelance writing all day, so I read books only at night. Jane went to sleep quickly and didnât mind the light on my side of the bed. I read &lt;em&gt;The Decline and Fall of theÂ &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roman Empire&lt;/em&gt; and six huge volumes of Henry Adamsâs letters. I read the late novels of Henry James over and over again. After Jane died, I kept reading books, at first only murderous or violent writers like Cormac McCarthy. Today I am forty years older than Jane ever got to be, and I realize I havenât finished reading a book in a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An athlete goes professional at twenty. At thirty, he is slower but more canny. At forty, he leaves behind the identity that he was born to and that sustained him. He diminishes into fifty, sixty, seventy. Anyone ambitious who lives to be old or even &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt;Â endures the inevitable loss of ambitionâs fulfillment. In a Hollywood retirement home to meet a friend, I watched a handsome old woman in a wheelchair, unrecognizable, leap up in ecstasy when I walked toward her. âAn interview!â she said. â&lt;em&gt;An interview&lt;/em&gt;!â A writer usually works until late in life. When I was eighty, still doing frequent poetry readings, audiences stood and clapped when I concluded, and kept on clapping until I shushed them. Of course I stayed to sign book after book and returned to my hotel understanding that they applauded so much because they would never see me again.Â &lt;span id=&quot;more-128082&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose I am the hundred-fifty-year-old maple outside my porch. When winter budges toward spring, I push out tiny leaves, which gradually curl yellowish green, then enlarge, turning darker green and flourishing through summer. In September, flecks of orange seep into green, and October turns the leaves gorgeously orange and red. Leaves fall, emptying the branches, and in December, only a few remain. In January, the last survivors flutter down onto snow. These black leaves are the words I write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then, I wrote all day, getting up at five. By this time, I rise scratchy at six or twitch in bed until seven. I drink coffee before I pick up a pen. I look through the newspaper. I try to write all morning, but exhaustion shuts me down by ten oâclock. I dictate a letter. I nap. I rise to a lunch of crackers and peanut butter, followed by further exhaustion. At night I watch baseball on television, and between innings run through the &lt;em&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/em&gt;. I roll over all night. Breakfast. Coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jane was alive, our dog Gus needed walking every day. Jane walked him when she woke, feeling sleepy before breakfast. When they left, I lifted my hand from the page, waving goodbye. Midday, we had lunch and a nap, and then I walked Gus. In my car, I drove him up New Canada, the dirt road near our house, and parked where the single lane widened. We walked the flat earth, not for long because I wanted to get back to the manuscript again. Now when someone brings a dog to the house, I barricade myself in a big chair. An attentive dog would break my hip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louise is my cat. Ten years ago, her vigorous sister Thelma squirmed out of the house and discovered Route 4. My assistant Kendel dug a hole, and we set a half-barrel over the grave to impede hungry animals from enjoying a Thelma snack. Louise is passive, too shy to scoot through an open door. At night, when I watch MSNBC, she annoys me by rubbing my knee, but she never knocks me over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Striving to pay the mortgage in the late seventies and eighties, some years I published four books. Now it takes me a month to finish seven hundred words. Here they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Donald Hall (1928â2018) served as the U.S. poet laureate from 2006 to 2007. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and a recipient of the National Medal of the Arts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Universal Method to Sort Complex Information Found</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;If you were opening a coffee shop, thereâs a question youâd want answered: Whereâs the next closest cafe? This information would help you understand your competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This scenario is an example of a type of problem widely studied in computer science called ânearest neighborâ search. It asks, given a data set and a new data point, which point in your existing data is closest to your new point? Itâs a question that comes up in many everyday situations in areas such as genomics research, image searches and Spotify recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And unlike the coffee shop example, nearest neighbor questions are often very hard to answer. Over the past few decades, top minds in computer science have applied themselves to finding a better way to solve the problem. In particular, theyâve tried to address complications that arise because different data sets can use very different definitions of what it means for two points to be âcloseâ to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a team of computer scientists has come up with a radically new way of solving nearest neighbor problems. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ilyaraz.org/static/papers/spectral_gap.pdf&quot;&gt;pair&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://ilyaraz.org/static/papers/daher.pdf&quot;&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt;, five computer scientists have elaborated the first general-purpose method of solving nearest neighbor questions for complex data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âThis is the first result that captures a rich collection of spaces using a single algorithmic technique,â said &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.csail.mit.edu/indyk/&quot;&gt;Piotr Indyk&lt;/a&gt;, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and influential figure in the development of nearest neighbor search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Distance Difference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weâre so thoroughly accustomed to one way of defining distance that itâs easy to miss that there could be others. We generally measure distance using âEuclideanâ distance, which draws a straight line between two points. But there are situations in which other definitions of distance make more sense. For example, âManhattanâ distance forces you to make 90-degree turns, as if you were walking on a street grid. Using Manhattan distance, a point 5 miles away as the crow flies might require you to go across town for 3 miles and then uptown another 4 miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itâs also possible to think of distance in completely nongeographical terms. What is the distance between two people on Facebook, or two movies, or two genomes? In these examples, âdistanceâ means how similar the two things are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There exist dozens of distance metrics, each suited to a particular kind of problem. Take two genomes, for example. Biologists compare them using âedit distance.â Using edit distance, the distance between two genetic sequences is the number of additions, deletions, insertions and replacements required to convert one into the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit distance and Euclidean distance are two completely different notions of distance â thereâs no way to reduce one to the other. This incommensurability is true for many pairs of distance metrics, and it poses a challenge for computer scientists trying to develop nearest neighbor algorithms. It means that an algorithm that works for one type of distance wonât work for another â that is, until this new way of searching came along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Squaring the Circle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find a nearest neighbor, the standard approach is to partition your existing data into subgroups. Imagine, for instance, your data is the location of cows in a pasture. Draw circles around groups of cows. Now place a new cow in the pasture and ask, which circle does it fall in? Chances are good â or even guaranteed â that your new cowâs nearest neighbor is also in that circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then repeat the process. Partition your circle into subcircles, partition those partitions, and so on. Eventually, youâll end up with a partition that contains just two points: an existing point and your new point. And that existing point is your new pointâs nearest neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Algorithms draw these partitions, and good algorithm will draw them quickly and well â with âwellâ meaning that youâre not likely to end up in a situation where your new cow falls in one circle but its nearest neighbor stands in another. âFrom these partitions we want close points to end up in the same disc often and far points to end up in the same disc rarely,â said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ilyaraz.org/&quot;&gt;Ilya Razenshteyn&lt;/a&gt;, a computer scientist at Microsoft Research and coauthor of the new work along with &lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.columbia.edu/alex-andoni&quot;&gt;Alexandr Andoni&lt;/a&gt; of Columbia University, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.math.princeton.edu/~naor/&quot;&gt;Assaf Naor&lt;/a&gt; of Princeton University, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~anikolov/&quot;&gt;Aleksandar Nikolov&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Toronto and &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/site/erikwaing/home&quot;&gt;Erik Waingarten&lt;/a&gt; of Columbia University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, computer scientists have come up with various algorithms for drawing these partitions. For low-dimensional data â where each point is defined by only a few values, like the locations of cows in a pasture â algorithms create what are called âVoronoi diagrams,â which solve the nearest neighbor question exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For higher-dimensional data, where each point can be defined by hundreds or thousands of values, Voronoi diagrams become too computationally intensive. So instead, computer scientists draw partitions using a technique called âlocality sensitive hashing (LSH)â that was first defined by Indyk and &lt;a href=&quot;http://theory.stanford.edu/people/rajeev/&quot;&gt;Rajeev Motwani&lt;/a&gt; in 1998. LSH algorithms draw partitions randomly. This makes them faster to run but also less accurate â instead of finding a pointâs exact nearest neighbor, they guarantee youâll find a point thatâs within some fixed distance of the actual nearest neighbor. (You can think of this as being like Netflix giving you a movie recommendation thatâs good enough, rather than the very best.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the late 1990s, computer scientists have come up with LSH algorithms that give approximate solutions to the nearest neighbor problem for specific distance metrics. These algorithms have tended to be very specialized, meaning an algorithm developed for one distance metric couldnât be applied to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âYou could get a very efficient algorithm for Euclidean distance, or Manhattan distance, for some very specific important cases. But we didnât have an algorithmic technique that worked on a large class of distances,â said Indyk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because algorithms developed for one distance metric couldnât be used in another, computer scientists developed a workaround strategy. Through a process called âembedding,â theyâd overlay a distance metric for which they didnât have a good algorithm on a distance metric for which they did. But the fit between metrics was usually imprecise â a square peg in a round hole type of situation. In some cases, embeddings werenât possible at all. What was needed instead was an all-purpose way of answering nearest neighbor questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Surprise Result&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this new work, the computer scientists began by stepping back from the pursuit of specific nearest neighbor algorithms. Instead, they asked a broader question: What prevents a good nearest neighbor algorithm from existing for a distance metric?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer, they thought, had to do with a particularly troublesome setting in which to find nearest neighbors called an âexpander graph.â An expander graph is a specific type of graph â a collection of points connected by edges. Graphs have their own distance metric. The distance between two points on a graph is the minimum number of lines you need to traverse to get from one point to the other. You could imagine a graph representing connections between people on Facebook, for example, where the distance between people is their degree of separation. (If Julianne Moore had a friend who had a friend who is friends with Kevin Bacon, then the Moore-Bacon distance would be 3.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An expander graph is a special type of graph that has two seemingly contradictory properties: Itâs well-connected, meaning you cannot disconnect points without cutting many edges. But at the same time, most points are connected to very few other points. As a result of this last trait, most points end up being far away from each other (because the low-connectivity means you have to take a long, circuitous route between most points).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This unique combination of features â well-connectedness, but with few edges overall â has the consequence that itâs impossible to perform fast nearest neighbor search on expander graphs. The reason itâs impossible is that any effort to partition points on an expander graph is likely to separate close points from each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âAny way to cut the points on an expander into two parts would be cutting many edges, splitting many close points,â said Waingarten, a coauthor of the new work.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: A side project in medical devices</title>
<link>https://chrisseaton.com/merseyburns/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://chrisseaton.com/merseyburns/</guid>
<description>&lt;header&gt;

&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mersey Burns is an app for iPhone and Android to help doctors quickly and accurately prescribe resuscitation fluids to seriously burned people in emergencies. I wrote it as a side-project in my spare time around 2011 when I was planning to change career from the military into software development. Along the way, my collaborators and I figured out how to get an app into use by the UKâs National Health Service and how to regulate a phone app as a medical device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turned into a successful project, leading to media appearances, speaking invitations, development and consulting contact work with major pharmaceutical companies, and it gave me something to concrete to talk about when people asked me what I could do. I still bump into people who have used it today, and I still use it to show that I can generate an idea, implement it, navigate regulation and industry politics, ship the project, market it, support it, and generate leads for future business opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article talks about what we achieved with Mersey Burns and how I built a successful side project for my portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-the-app-does&quot;&gt;What the app does&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone is very seriously burned they lose a lot of fluid from their damaged skin. You need to put fluid back into them, but too little fluid isnât effective and too much fluid can be harmful. Working out the correct volume of fluid requires:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working out how much of the body surface are has been burned using a table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding out the age of the patient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding out the weight of the patient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding out how long ago they were burned&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing a calculation based on these values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://chrisseaton.com/merseyburns/calculation.png&quot; alt=&quot;Burns calculation&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors who donât often see serious burns patients can get this process seriously wrong - they mis-estimate the body surface, they donât know the calculation, and they also simply get the arithmetic in the calculation wrong. This leads to large margins of error on the volume of fluid that they prescribe, and unnecessary additional harm to burns victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mersey Burns solves these problems by giving you an intuitive way to work out the burn area and doing the calculation for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctor draws the burned areas on an outline of a person, enters their age, weight and time of burn. The weight can be estimated from the age if itâs not known. A button then shows the doctor the fluids prescription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://chrisseaton.com/merseyburns/using.png&quot; alt=&quot;Using Mersey Burns&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app is still available on the App Store, Google Play, but only in the United Kingdom, and an online version. In the past it was also available on Blackberryâs store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mersey Burns is regulated by Her Majestyâs Government as a medical device and recommended by NHS trusts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/mersey-burns/id481808668?mt=8&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Available on the App Store&quot; src=&quot;https://chrisseaton.com/merseyburns/appstore.png&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;45&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Â Â Â Â  &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.merseyburns&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Available on the Google Play Store&quot; src=&quot;https://chrisseaton.com/merseyburns/playstore.png&quot; width=&quot;130&quot; height=&quot;45&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Â Â Â Â  &lt;img alt=&quot;Available on the App Store&quot; src=&quot;https://chrisseaton.com/merseyburns/ce.png&quot; width=&quot;45&quot; height=&quot;45&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-mersey-burns-came-about&quot;&gt;How Mersey Burns came about&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010 I was a captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps and thinking about leaving to go into a career in software development. I was looking for some kind of side-project to show that I could program, not having really written any code I could show since I graduated from my undergraduate degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My fiancÃ©e was working with a plastic surgeon, Rowan Pritchard Jones, who had also been in the Royal Army Medical Corps, who was thinking about his own medical equivalent of a side-project - writing a book with his colleague, Paul McArthur. They decided to do some form of app instead to make it different, and asked me if I was interested in working with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rowan and Paul understood the problems that people faced and how things could be better, and I understood how we could use technology to achieve that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;prototype-implementation&quot;&gt;Prototype implementation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prototyped the app first as a Qt desktop application, where I worked out how to allow the user to colour in an outline of a person and get a percentage of the body area. The different regions of the body account for different proportions of the body, and it also varies by age, so I had a bitmap that was the drawn regions, then bitmaps for each region and I did a conjunction, counted the pixels in that, then as a proportion of all the pixels in each region, and used a table to get the total area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://chrisseaton.com/merseyburns/qt-prototype.png&quot; alt=&quot;Prototype in Qt&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then prototyped the same idea as an iPhone app. I didnât have any experience in mobile app development, so I was also learning the basics of this, Objective-C, and the iOS API at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://chrisseaton.com/merseyburns/ios-prototype.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Prototype in iOS&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;production-implementation&quot;&gt;Production implementation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a new implementation of the app in iOS based on the prototype, adding user interface elements for all the functionality that we wanted. We wanted the outline of the person to be touch-to-draw, but also to be touch-to-scroll at the same time, which involved a lot of trial and error and poking around in the iOS API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked hard to make the app look very high quality. At the time there were some other medical apps that implemented some kind of calculator, and they invariably were in my opinion garish, childish and cheap looking. To me, they didnât inspire any kind of confidence of clinical excellence. We thought just looking better could be something unique, even though the rest of our app was also novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâd gotten the medical logic right in the prototype, and most of the development work was pretty awkward fumbling around trying to make the UI work intuitively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added a self-test functionality, with a table of inputs and expected outputs that we run each time the app started. This was like unit-testing but at runtime to ensure the app behaved the same way even if the hardware or operating system changed somehow out from underneath us and people already had the app on their devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I extended the iPhone version for an iPad version. I learned about how to write an Android app and wrote an Android version. I wrote a Blackberry version months after they sent me a free device following the publicity Iâll describe below. I also wrote an HTML 5 web app version, as that was a popular concept at the time and meant we could run on existing desktops in emergency departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://chrisseaton.com/merseyburns/webapp.png&quot; alt=&quot;Web app version of Mersey Burns&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-we-worked-with-the-nhs-and-regulators&quot;&gt;How we worked with the NHS and regulators&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After most of the work of the production implementation was done, we started to talk to the NHS (the United Kingdomâs nationalised health service) and the universities, medical schools and research institutions where my colleagues worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, there was a particular enthusiasm for the idea of mobile health, and there were questions going around about how this was to be regulated. Our project just happened to fit into almost exactly what several people with resources and influence were trying to encourage. In order to get the local NHS authorities to adopt the project, we actually sold them the intellectual property rights to Mersey Burns for a single pound (about $1.60), and got them to take on the liability for the use of the app within the NHS. We also took a grant of several tens of thousand pounds from a Health and Innovation Cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did two particularly innovative things next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we showed that the app was statistically better than the traditional method using a study that we had published as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://emj.bmj.com/content/32/8/637&quot;&gt;peer-reviewed article in the Emergency Medicine Journal&lt;/a&gt;. We found a lower variance in total body surface area estimation and fluid calculation. This kind of publication is what youâd normally do if you came up with a new medical procedure, so we were positioning our app as something equivalent to that, and doing the same professional steps to have it reviewed and published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://chrisseaton.com/merseyburns/figure.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure from the Mersey Burns paper&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we got the app regulated as an actual formal medical device. People at the time were worrying about whether this was needed for apps. Even large companies, were sort of burying their heads in the sand about it. Somewhat naively we decided to just give it a go, and went ahead and did it! It turned out that as we were the first in the United Kingdom to do this, we could have a bit of back-and-forth with the regulators to figure out how best to do it, and we proposed the testing system Iâd developed, and our peer-reviewed article as a way to satisfy their demands. Being the first turned out to be the better way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were also âbadgedâ by the British Association of Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons, BAPRAS (serious burns are treated by plastic surgeons).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-we-publicised-what-wed-built&quot;&gt;How we publicised what weâd built&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time weâd got this far Iâd left the Army and was now a doctoral student at the University of Manchester - Mersey Burns had been very effective for convincing my advisor that I could program well enough to start a PhD. Universities have dedicated media departments and are skilled at feeding stories into the local and national media as building their reputation is important to them. We had a story that was easy to sell - a former soldier (and this was while the Afghanistan campaign was still major daily news) and now student developing an app to help victims of serious burns. Mobile phone apps were still somewhat novel at the time, and this looked like an example of how they could really help people in need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University put out a press release and generated for us a TV news piece, a radio interview, and a full-page article in a national newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://chrisseaton.com/merseyburns/north-west-today.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Mersey Burns on North West Today&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We put ourselves forward for health and technology awards, and similar to the media interest we were often exactly what they were looking for and we ended up going to lot of black tie dinners in London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Winner, Excellence in Mobile Healthcare and overall winner, eHealth Insider Awards, 2013&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly Commended, Improving Care with Technology, Health Service Journal Awards, 2013&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly Commended, Innovative Mobile App of the Year, BCS UK IT Industry Awards, 2013&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly Commended, Best Use of Mobile Technology in Healthcare, eHealth Insider Awards, 2012&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Winner, Excellence in Innovation, NHS North West Health Innovation Awards, 2011&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were even the subject of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nice.org.uk/advice/mib58/resources/mersey-burns-for-calculating-fluid-resuscitation-volume-when-managing-burns-pdf-63499233245893&quot;&gt;twenty-five page briefing&lt;/a&gt; by the United Kingdomâs National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-we-built-on-success&quot;&gt;How we built on success&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we had given away the IP for Mersey Burns and hadnât made any substantial income from it, we then built on the success of our side project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did commercial consulting work for other companies, including one of the leading international pharmaceutical companies, trying to make their own medical device apps. We could show them what weâd done, our testing systems, and how we had achieved regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We built under contract a second app for the NHS that implemented similar clinical calculators but this time for a range of antibiotic drugs. We generalised the process so that we could declaratively specify a clinical algorithm rather than writing custom code each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://chrisseaton.com/merseyburns/antibiotic.png&quot; alt=&quot;The antibiotic app&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a time I thought about doing a startup to build a system for anyone with a medical algorithm to write an Excel spreadsheet version and turn it into an app, but in the end I decided I was more interested in computer science research than business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that I tell anyone trying to develop their own app in the medical industry is to just get on and do it themselves. When itâs working then start to show people. If you involve more than a couple of people in the early design youâll get into a bog of opinions that slows you down. A working minimal-viable-product is everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When youâve got something that works and people are interested in it then you need to be a bit aggressive and shameless about promoting your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can give the media a story that they want then they will be coming to you to promote your work for you. That then gets more people to come and talk to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that there were a lot of awards and prizes that we could enter. The people running these are presumably tasked to find projects to champion, so if you turn up with something great they will be glad to run with it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing a safety-critical app for multiple platforms is an absolute nightmare. I never want to develop this kind of front-end software ever again. Just the mundane problems of iOS key management and working with all the different SDKs drained my enthusiasm. Maintaining a project on top of constantly changing platforms is also demoralising. People would email me and say it didnât run on some Android phone variant Iâd never heard of. All the ecosystems are a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Iâve said, I can always point to Mersey Burns to show that I can do the full spectrum where I generate an idea, implement it, navigate regulation and industry politics, ship the project, market it, support it, and generate leads for future business opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People I meet today still ask if Iâm âthat chap with the burns appâ, and a great thing about an app is I always have it on my phone and as itâs quite a tactile app even people who arenât doctors can trying colouring in the patient to see how much fluid theyâd need.

<title>Would You Let the I.R.S. Prepare Your Taxes? (2015)</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;âIt was a huge signal to politicians everywhere how much Intuit cares about this,â Mr. Bankman said. âPeople in other states who had been interested in it started saying, âWe just donât want to pick a fight with Intuit.âÂ â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Intuit is far from the only opponent of return-free filing. Groups that call for lower taxes, like Grover Norquistâs &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.atr.org/&quot; title=&quot;Americans for Tax Reform website. &quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Americans for Tax Reform&lt;/a&gt;, say it is a âconflict of interestâ for the government to both collect taxes and calculate how much people owe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Although all advocates for return-free filing stress that the program would be voluntary, Ryan Ellis, tax policy director for Americans for Tax Reform, said that mail from the I.R.S. did not strike people as optional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;âIf youâre a typical American and you get this packet from the I.R.S. that says, âHereâs what weâve determined your liability is,â no one is going to challenge it,â Mr. Ellis said. âPeople are scared, intimidated or otherwise occupied in their lives, and theyâre going to just accept what the I.R.S. sends them.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Some scholars say that government tax collectors may not have adequate resources to set up the program, and that it may not ultimately save many much time and money. âSome people wouldnât have to buy software, but if you consider the cost to the I.R.S., my sense is the net social costs might go up,â said Eric Toder, co-director of the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.brookings.edu/about/centers/taxpolicy&quot; title=&quot;Urban-Brookings website. &quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Bankman agrees that people may not always challenge the I.R.S.âs calculation, but argues the I.R.S. might include tax breaks that taxpayers wouldnât have otherwise found. (Critics of the I.R.S., which revealed in 2013 that it had targeted conservative groups for special scrutiny when determining tax status, scoff at this idea.) Mr. Bankman also conceded that while he has no hard data to suggest that the program would save money nationally, in California, the program was found to be cost-effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;âOne of the biggest costs that people have is the anxiety â and this would definitely cut down on that,â he said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: TabNine, an autocompleter for all languages</title>
<link>https://tabnine.com/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://tabnine.com/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;TabNine is the all-language autocompleter. It uses machine learning to provide responsive, reliable, and relevant suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional autocompleters suggest one word at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why accept this limitation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Feature&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Premium&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Free&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Whole project indexing&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;.gitignore awareness&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Fuzzy matching&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;No configuration necessary&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;~20 millisecond response time&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Context-aware suggestions&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Vim support&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sublime Text support&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;VS Code support&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Atom support&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Up to 200 KB indexed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Up to 15 MB indexed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tabnine.com/install&quot;&gt;Install TabNine here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; TabNine is easy to install and no configuration is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If TabNine does not work as soon as you install it, this is a bug and you &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zxqfl/tabnine-vim/issues&quot;&gt;should&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zxqfl/tabnine-sublime/issues&quot;&gt;file&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zxqfl/tabnine-atom/issues&quot;&gt;an&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zxqfl/tabnine-vscode/issues&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TabNine builds an index of your project, reading your .gitignore so that only source files are included. It uses this index to provide useful information to a softmax regression model which ranks candidate completions. For example, TabNine knows how often each pair of consecutive symbols appears in your project, so it knows that &lt;code&gt;static void&lt;/code&gt; is more common than &lt;code&gt;void static&lt;/code&gt; (although they are the same to a C++ compiler).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The candidate completions are then given to a secondary completion engine, which may suggest additional characters for completion, based on similar patterns found elsewhere in your project. This diagram illustrates the role of this completion engine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;diagram&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tabnine.com/graph1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another abstraction layer parameterizes the patterns by the identifiers they contain, allowing TabNine to provide suggestions involving words that it has only seen once, such as &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; in this example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tabnine.com/gallery8.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a diagram illustrating this process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;diagram&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tabnine.com/graph2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;instructions&quot;&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Buy a license&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TabNine costs $29. It is currently in beta. When it is released, your software will automatically update to the full released version at no additional charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TabNine will save you at least 1 second per minute. If you value your time above $0.83/hour, it will pay for itself in less than a year. (Assuming 2087 hours in a work year.)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>AMD Announces 7nm Rome CPUs and MI60 GPUs</title>
<link>https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-new-horizon-7nm-cpu,38029.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-new-horizon-7nm-cpu,38029.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imgContent imgCenter&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imgWrapperOutter&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imgWrapperInner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;iZoom&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; data-src=&quot;https://img.purch.com/img-7243-jpg/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9GL1MvODA5MjcyL29yaWdpbmFsL0lNR183MjQzLkpQRw==&quot; big-src=&quot;https://img.purch.com/img-7243-jpg/o/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9GL1MvODA5MjcyL29yaWdpbmFsL0lNR183MjQzLkpQRw==&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're here at AMD's Next Horizon Event to bring you up to the minute news on the company's 7nm products. This is breaking news, so check back frequently or refresh the page for updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD is expected to make major announcements about its new 7nm CPUs and GPUs. Intel continues to struggle with its 10nm manufacturing process, which is delayed until late 2019. If AMD can field 7nm processors early this year, it will mark the first time in the company's history that it has had a process node leadership position over Intel. That should equate to faster, denser, and less power-hungry processors than Intel's 14nm chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imgContent imgCenter&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imgWrapperOutter&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imgWrapperInner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;iZoom&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; data-src=&quot;https://img.purch.com/20181106-090308-jpg/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9EL08vODA5MTk2L29yaWdpbmFsLzIwMTgxMTA2XzA5MDMwOC5qcGc=&quot; big-src=&quot;https://img.purch.com/20181106-090308-jpg/o/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9EL08vODA5MTk2L29yaWdpbmFsLzIwMTgxMTA2XzA5MDMwOC5qcGc=&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;AMD CEO Lisa Su is delivering the opening statements. She recounted the path of the EPYC data center processors to market and discussing many of the key roles those processors are used for, such as workloads in HPC, cloud, hyperscale, and virtualization environments. AMD sees the data center as a $29 billion opportunity by 2021, and GPUs are playing a larger role as the industry shifts to artificial intelligence and machine learning workloads. &lt;span class=&quot;imgContent imgCenter&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imgWrapperOutter&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imgWrapperInner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;iZoom&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; data-src=&quot;https://img.purch.com/20181106-091702-jpg/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9EL1AvODA5MTk3L29yaWdpbmFsLzIwMTgxMTA2XzA5MTcwMi5qcGc=&quot; big-src=&quot;https://img.purch.com/20181106-091702-jpg/o/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9EL1AvODA5MTk3L29yaWdpbmFsLzIwMTgxMTA2XzA5MTcwMi5qcGc=&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon Web Services, one of the world's largest cloud service providers, announced that, beginning today, it is offering new EPYC-powered cloud instances. The R5a, M5a and T3a instances purportedly will offer a 10% price-to-performance advantage over AWS's other cloud instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Papermaster will cover the new Zen 2 cores and AMD's 7nm process technology. AMD will also reveal more about the 7nm Mi60 Instinct GPU for the data center. AMD will also provide early specifications for AMD's Rome, the first x86 7nm processor for the data center.Â &lt;span class=&quot;imgContent imgCenter&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imgWrapperOutter&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imgWrapperInner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;iZoom&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; data-src=&quot;https://img.purch.com/20181106-092626-jpg/w/711/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9EL1MvODA5MjAwL29yaWdpbmFsLzIwMTgxMTA2XzA5MjYyNi5qcGc=&quot; big-src=&quot;https://img.purch.com/20181106-092626-jpg/o/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9EL1MvODA5MjAwL29yaWdpbmFsLzIwMTgxMTA2XzA5MjYyNi5qcGc=&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD is already sampling its 7nm Rome processors, which mark the debut of the Zen 2 microarchitecture, to customers. The firm also has its Zen 3 processors under development. This third-gen microarchitecture will debut on the 7nm+ process, with the &quot;+&quot; indicating this will be a second generation of the 7nm node (a &quot;tock&quot; equivalent).Â &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new processors feature faster, smaller, and lower-power transistors. As with all new nodes, development requires a significant investment from both AMD and TSMC, which will fab the parts. The high up-front costs associated with developing a new node pushed AMD's primary manufacturing partner, Global Foundries, out of the 7nm race earlier this year. AMD remains committed to delivering the new node and using it as a vehicle to deliver the new Zen 2 microarchitecture to market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD also announced that it is already working on the Zen 4 microarchitecture, but didn't reveal significant details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zen 2 will provide up to 2X the compute power per node, improved execution pipeline, doubled core density, and use half the energy per operation. AMD has doubled floating point performance with the Zen 2 microarchitecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMD has improved the branch predictor, pre-fetching engine, and doubled the load/store bandwidth. AMD also doubled the vector width to 256-bit. We'll follow up with deeper analysis. This type of technical data isn't well suited for live public disclosure.Â &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMD has improved the Infinity Fabric. AMD is now using the second-gen Infinity Fabric to connect a multi-chip design with a 14nm I/O die serving as the linchpin of the design. That central chip ties together the 7nm CPU chiplets, creating a massively scalable architecture. We'll follow up with deeper analysis of this design. Note that the DDR4 controllers are all attached to the central I/O chip. That will result in higher memory latency to all connected controllers, but memory latency will be consistent for all compute chiplets (assuming perfectly linear data delivery across the fabric). That should be a major step forward for AMD to address concerns about performance variability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Wang displayed the world's first 7nm GPU. The die wields 13.28B transistors and measures just 331mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The GPU is based on the advanced Vega architecture and is the first PCIe 4.0 GPU on the market. It also is the first to use the Infinity Fabric over the external PCIe bus and the first GPU to have 1TB/s of memory bandwidth. The MI60 offers up to 7.4 TFLOPS of FP64 and 14.7 TFLOPS of FP32.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMD also presented performance benchmarks highlighting the generational performance gains relative to 12nm GPUs. It also presented scalability benchmarks to highlight gains due to the increased PCIe 4.0 bandwidth. The company also provided direct comparisons to Nvidia's V100 GPUs. These results are, of course, vendor-provided, so we'll have to dive deeper into the conditions of the benchmarks.Â  &lt;span class=&quot;imgContent imgCenter&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imgWrapperOutter&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imgWrapperInner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;iZoom&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; data-src=&quot;https://img.purch.com/20181106-102355-jpg/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9GLzkvODA5MjUzL29yaWdpbmFsLzIwMTgxMTA2XzEwMjM1NS5qcGc=&quot; big-src=&quot;https://img.purch.com/20181106-102355-jpg/o/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9GLzkvODA5MjUzL29yaWdpbmFsLzIwMTgxMTA2XzEwMjM1NS5qcGc=&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD presented its new GPU roadmap. Shipping MI60 this quarter. &quot;MI-Next&quot; is in development, but with no firm date given for delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 7nm Rome CPUs come with 64 physical Zen 2 cores, which equates to 128 threads per processor, double that of the first-gen Naples chips. In a two socket server, that equates to 128 physical cores and 256 threads in a single box. Rome is also the first PCIe 4.0 CPU, which offers double the bandwidth per channel. &lt;span class=&quot;imgContent imgCenter&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imgWrapperOutter&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imgWrapperInner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;iZoom&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; data-src=&quot;https://img.purch.com/20181106-112322-jpg/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9GL08vODA5MjY4L29yaWdpbmFsLzIwMTgxMTA2XzExMjMyMi5qcGc=&quot; big-src=&quot;https://img.purch.com/20181106-112322-jpg/o/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9GL08vODA5MjY4L29yaWdpbmFsLzIwMTgxMTA2XzExMjMyMi5qcGc=&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD has also made the processors backward compatible with its existing server ecosystem. These drop-in replacements offer twice the performance of the previous generation per socket. You also get four times the floating point performance per chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imgContent imgCenter&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imgWrapperOutter&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imgWrapperInner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;iZoom&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; data-src=&quot;https://img.purch.com/-582e55b65e9d6a001e8f5652ca477a00c23d86a6be242a50ca-pimgpsh-fullsize-distr-jpg/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9GL04vODA5MjY3L29yaWdpbmFsLy01ODJFNTVCNjVFOUQ2QTAwMUU4RjU2NTJDQTQ3N0EwMEMyM0Q4NkE2QkUyNDJBNTBDQS1waW1ncHNoX2Z1bGxzaXplX2Rpc3RyLmpwZw==&quot; big-src=&quot;https://img.purch.com/-582e55b65e9d6a001e8f5652ca477a00c23d86a6be242a50ca-pimgpsh-fullsize-distr-jpg/o/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9GL04vODA5MjY3L29yaWdpbmFsLy01ODJFNTVCNjVFOUQ2QTAwMUU4RjU2NTJDQTQ3N0EwMEMyM0Q4NkE2QkUyNDJBNTBDQS1waW1ncHNoX2Z1bGxzaXplX2Rpc3RyLmpwZw==&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are eight 7nm eight-core die tied to a central 14nm I/O die. &lt;span class=&quot;imgContent imgCenter&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imgWrapperOutter&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imgWrapperInner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;iZoom&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; data-src=&quot;https://img.purch.com/-16d682cbcbac77a99a1276961cb0ed9af44ea7a8a1b9fac20a-pimgpsh-fullsize-distr-jpg/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9GL1QvODA5MjczL29yaWdpbmFsLy0xNkQ2ODJDQkNCQUM3N0E5OUExMjc2OTYxQ0IwRUQ5QUY0NEVBN0E4QTFCOUZBQzIwQS1waW1ncHNoX2Z1bGxzaXplX2Rpc3RyLmpwZw==&quot; big-src=&quot;https://img.purch.com/-16d682cbcbac77a99a1276961cb0ed9af44ea7a8a1b9fac20a-pimgpsh-fullsize-distr-jpg/o/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9GL1QvODA5MjczL29yaWdpbmFsLy0xNkQ2ODJDQkNCQUM3N0E5OUExMjc2OTYxQ0IwRUQ5QUY0NEVBN0E4QTFCOUZBQzIwQS1waW1ncHNoX2Z1bGxzaXplX2Rpc3RyLmpwZw==&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD also displayed a demo with the 7nm Rome CPUs and the 7nm GPU MI60 CPUs together.AMD also displayed a single Rome processor beating two of Intel's flagship 8180 CPUs in a rendering benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Impostor syndrome strikes men just as hard as women in technical interviews</title>
<link>http://blog.interviewing.io/impostor-syndrome-strikes-men-just-as-hard-as-women-and-other-findings-from-thousands-of-technical-interviews/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.interviewing.io/impostor-syndrome-strikes-men-just-as-hard-as-women-and-other-findings-from-thousands-of-technical-interviews/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The modern technical interview is a rite of passage for software engineers and (hopefully!) the precursor to a great job. But itâs also a huge source of stress and endless questions for new candidates. Just searching âhow do I prepare for a technical interviewâ turns up millions of Medium posts, coding bootcamp blogs, Quora discussions, and entire books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite all this conversation, people struggle to know how theyâre even doing in interviews. &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.interviewing.io/people-are-still-bad-at-gauging-their-own-interview-performance-heres-the-data/&quot;&gt;In a previous post&lt;/a&gt;, we found that a surprisingly large number of interviewing.ioâs users consistently underestimate their performance, making them more likely to drop out of the process and ultimately harder to hire. Now, and with considerably more data (over 10k interviews led by real software engineers!), we wanted to go deeper: &lt;strong&gt;what seems to make candidates worse at gauging their own performance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know some general facts that make accuracy a challenge: people arenât always great at assessing or even remembering their performance on difficult cognitive tasks like writing code.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;imposter-ref1&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.interviewing.io/impostor-syndrome-strikes-men-just-as-hard-as-women-and-other-findings-from-thousands-of-technical-interviews/#imposter-fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Technical interviews can be particularly hard to judge if candidates donât have much experience with questions with no single right answer. Since many companies donât share any kind of detailed post-interview feedback (beyond a yes/no) with candidates for liability reasons, many folks never get any sense of how they did, what they did well, or what could have been better.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;imposter-ref2&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.interviewing.io/impostor-syndrome-strikes-men-just-as-hard-as-women-and-other-findings-from-thousands-of-technical-interviews/#imposter-fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;imposter-ref3&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.interviewing.io/impostor-syndrome-strikes-men-just-as-hard-as-women-and-other-findings-from-thousands-of-technical-interviews/#imposter-fn3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Indeed, pulling back the curtain on interviewing, &lt;em&gt;across the industry,&lt;/em&gt; was one of the primary motivators for building interviewing.io!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to our knowledge thereâs little data out there looking specifically at how people feel after real interviews on this scale, across different companiesâso we gathered it, giving us the ability to test interesting industry assumptions about engineers and coding confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One big factor we were interested in was &lt;strong&gt;impostor syndrome&lt;/strong&gt;. Impostor syndrome resonates with a lot of engineers,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;imposter-ref4&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.interviewing.io/impostor-syndrome-strikes-men-just-as-hard-as-women-and-other-findings-from-thousands-of-technical-interviews/#imposter-fn4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; indicating that many wonder whether they truly match up to colleagues and discount even strong evidence of competence as a fluke. Impostor syndrome can make us wonder whether we can count on the positive performance feedback that weâre getting, and how much our opportunities have come from our own effort, versus luck. Of particular interest to us was whether this would show up for women on our platform. Thereâs a lot of research evidence that candidates from underrepresented backgrounds experience a greater lack of belonging that feeds impostor syndrome,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;imposter-ref5&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.interviewing.io/impostor-syndrome-strikes-men-just-as-hard-as-women-and-other-findings-from-thousands-of-technical-interviews/#imposter-fn5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and this could show up as inaccuracy about judging your own interview performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;The setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;interviewing.io is a platform where people can practice technical interviewing anonymously, and if things go well, get jobs at top companies in the process.Â We started it because resumes uck and because we believe that anyone, regardless of how they look on paper, should have the opportunity to prove their mettle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an interviewer and an interviewee match on interviewing.io, they meet in a collaborative coding environment with voice, text chat, and a whiteboard and jump right into a technical question (feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;https://interviewing.io/recordings/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;watch this process in action on our interview recordings page&lt;/a&gt;).Â  After each interview, people leave one another feedback, and each party can see what the other person said about them once they both submit their reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hereâs an example of an interviewer feedback form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_118&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/interviewer-feedback.png&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-118&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-118&quot; src=&quot;http://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/new_interviewer_feedback_circled.png&quot; alt=&quot;Feedback form for interviewers&quot; width=&quot;450&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Feedback form for interviewers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately after the interview, candidates answered a question about how well they thought theyâd done on the same 1-4 scale:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_122&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/interviewee-feedback.png&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-122&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-122&quot; src=&quot;http://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/new_interviewee_feedback_circled.png&quot; alt=&quot;Feedback form for interviewees&quot; width=&quot;450&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Feedback form for interviewees&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this post, we looked at over 10k technical interviews led by real software engineers from top companies. In each interview, a candidate was rated by an interviewer on their problem-solving ability, technical ability, and communication skills, as well as whether the interviewer would advance them to the next round. This gave us a measure of how different someoneâs self-rating was from the rating that the interviewer actually gave them, and in which direction. In other words, how skewed was their estimation from their true performance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going in, we had some hunches about what might matter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender.&lt;/strong&gt; Would women be harder on their coding performance than men?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having been an interviewer before.&lt;/strong&gt; It seems reasonable that having been on the other side will pull back the curtain on interviews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being employed at a top company.&lt;/strong&gt; Similar to above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being a top-performing interviewee&lt;/strong&gt; on interviewing.io â people who are better interviewees overall might have more confidence and awareness of when theyâve gotten things right (or wrong!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being in the Bay Area&lt;/strong&gt; or not. Since tech is still so geographically centered on the Bay Area, we considered that folks who live in a more engineering-saturated culture could have greater familiarity with professional norms around interviews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Within the interview itself, question quality and interviewer quality.&lt;/strong&gt; Presumably, a better interviewer is also a better communicator, whereas a confusing interviewer might throw off a candidatesâ entire assessment of their performance. We also looked at whether it was a practice interview, or for a specific company role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For some candidates, we could also look at few measures of their &lt;strong&gt;personal brand&lt;/strong&gt; within the industry, like their number of GitHub and Twitter followers. Maybe people with a strong online presence are more sure of themselves when they interview?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;So what did we find?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;subheading&quot;&gt;Women are just as accurate as men at assessing their technical ability&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to expectations around gender and confidence, we &lt;em&gt;didnât&lt;/em&gt; find a reliable statistically significant gender difference in accuracy. At first, it looked like female candidates were more likely to underestimate their performance, but when we controlled for other variables, like experience and rated technical ability, it turned out &lt;strong&gt;the key differentiator was experience.&lt;/strong&gt; More experienced engineers are more accurate about their interview performance, and men are more likely to be experienced engineers, but experienced female engineers are just as accurate about their technical ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on previous research, we hypothesized that impostor syndrome and a greater lack of belonging could result in female candidates penalizing their interview performance, but we didnât find that pattern.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;imposter-ref6&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.interviewing.io/impostor-syndrome-strikes-men-just-as-hard-as-women-and-other-findings-from-thousands-of-technical-interviews/#imposter-fn6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However, our finding echoes &lt;a href=&quot;https://gender.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/climbing_the_technical_ladder.pdf&quot;&gt;a research project from the Stanford Clayman Institute for Gender Research&lt;/a&gt;, which looked at 1,795 mid-level tech workers from high tech companies. They found that women in tech arenât necessarily less accurate when assessing their own abilities, but do have significantly different ideas about what success requires (e.g., long working hours and risk-taking). In other words, &lt;strong&gt;women in tech may not doubt their own abilities but might have different ideas about whatâs expected&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified&quot;&gt;And a survey from Harvard Business Review&lt;/a&gt; Â asking over a thousand professionals about their job application decisions also made this point. Their results emphasized that gender gaps in evaluation scenarios could be more about &lt;strong&gt;different expectations for how scenarios like interviews are judged.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, we did find one interesting difference: women went through fewer practice interviews overall than men did. The difference was small but statistically significant, and harkens back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.interviewing.io/we-built-voice-modulation-to-mask-gender-in-technical-interviews-heres-what-happened/&quot;&gt;our earlier finding that women leave interviewing.io roughly 7 times as often as men do&lt;/a&gt;, after a bad interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in that same earlier post, we also found that masking voices didnât impact interview outcomes. This whole cluster of findings affirms what we suspected and what the folks doing &lt;a href=&quot;https://gender.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/climbing_the_technical_ladder.pdf&quot;&gt;in-depth studies of gender in tech&lt;/a&gt; have found: &lt;strong&gt;itâs complicated.&lt;/strong&gt; Womenâs lack of persistence in interviews canât be explained only by impostor syndrome about their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; abilities, but itâs still likely that theyâre interpreting negative feedback more severely and making different assumptions about interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hereâs the distribution of accuracy distance for both female and male candidates on our platform (zero indicates a rating that matches the interviewerâs score, while negative values indicate underestimated score, and positive values indicate an overestimated score). The two groups look pretty much identical:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;plotly-container&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plot.ly/~aline_interviewingio/1098/?share_key=gOxJw5UZnY81R2sSiTGPnf&amp;amp;autosize=true&amp;amp;link=false&amp;amp;modebar=false&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Accuracy by gender&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://plot.ly/~aline_interviewingio/1098.png?share_key=gOxJw5UZnY81R2sSiTGPnf&amp;amp;autosize=true&amp;amp;link=false&amp;amp;modebar=false&quot; alt=&quot;Accuracy by gender&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; onerror=&quot;this.onerror=null;this.src='https://plot.ly/404.png';&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;subheading&quot;&gt;What else didnât matter?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another surprise: &lt;strong&gt;having been an interviewer didnât help&lt;/strong&gt;. Even people who had been interviewers themselves donât seem to get an accuracy boost from that. &lt;strong&gt;Personal brand was another non-finding&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;People with more GitHub followers werenât more accurate&lt;/strong&gt; than people with few to no GitHub followers. &lt;strong&gt;Nor did interviewer rating matter&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. how well an interviewer was reviewed by their candidates), although to be fair, interviewers are generally rated quite highly on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;subheading&quot;&gt;So what was a statistically significant boost to accurate judgments of interview performance? Mostly, experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experienced engineers have a better sense for how well they did in interviews, compared with engineers earlier in their careers.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;imposter-ref7&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.interviewing.io/impostor-syndrome-strikes-men-just-as-hard-as-women-and-other-findings-from-thousands-of-technical-interviews/#imposter-fn7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But it doesnât seem to &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; be that youâre better at gauging your interview performance because youâre better at writing code; although there is a small lift from this, with higher rated engineers being more accurate. But when you look at junior engineers, &lt;strong&gt;even top-performing junior candidates struggled to accurately assess their performance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;imposter-ref8&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.interviewing.io/impostor-syndrome-strikes-men-just-as-hard-as-women-and-other-findings-from-thousands-of-technical-interviews/#imposter-fn8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;Â Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;plotly-container&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plot.ly/~aline_interviewingio/1105/?share_key=Jhb6Jva7ZCsGvGaepdpQns&amp;amp;autosize=true&amp;amp;link=false&amp;amp;modebar=false&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;experienced versus juniors&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://plot.ly/~aline_interviewingio/1105.png?share_key=Jhb6Jva7ZCsGvGaepdpQns&quot; alt=&quot;experienced versus juniors&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; onerror=&quot;this.onerror=null;this.src='https://plot.ly/404.png';&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data mirrors a trend seen in &lt;a href=&quot;https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#connection-and-competition&quot;&gt;Stack Overflowâs 2018 Developer survey&lt;/a&gt;. They asked respondents several questions about confidence and competition with other developers, and noted that more experienced engineers feel less competitive and more confident.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;imposter-ref9&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.interviewing.io/impostor-syndrome-strikes-men-just-as-hard-as-women-and-other-findings-from-thousands-of-technical-interviews/#imposter-fn9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This isnât necessarily surprising: experience is correlated with skill level, after all, and highly skilled people are likely to be more confident. But our analysis let us control for performance and code skill within career groups, and we &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; found that experienced engineers were better at predicting their interview scores. There are probably multiple factors here: experienced engineers have been through more interviews, have led interviews themselves, and have a stronger sense of belonging, all of which may combat impostor syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insider knowledge and context also seems to help:&lt;/strong&gt; Being in the Bay Area and being at a top company both made people more accurate. Like the experienced career group, engineers who seem more likely to have &lt;em&gt;contextual industry knowledge&lt;/em&gt; are also more accurate. We found small but statistically significant lifts from factors like being located in the Bay Area and working at a top company. However, the lift from working at a top company seems to mostly measure a lift from overall technical ability: being at a top company is essentially a proxy measure for being a more experienced, higher quality engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, as you get better at interviewing and move into company interviews, you do get more accurate.&lt;/strong&gt; People were more accurate about their performance in company interviews compared to practice interviews, and their overall ranking on the interviewing.io site also predicted improved accuracy: interviewing.io also gives users an overall ranking, based on their performance over multiple interviews and weighted toward more recent measures. People who scored in the top 25% were more likely to be accurate about their interview performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, how are people at gauging their interview performance overall? &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.interviewing.io/people-are-still-bad-at-gauging-their-own-interview-performance-heres-the-data/&quot;&gt;Weâve looked at this before&lt;/a&gt;, with roughly a thousand interviews, and now, with ten thousand, the finding continues to hold up. Candidates were accurate about how they did in only 46% of interviews, and underestimated themselves in 35% of interviews (and the remaining 19%, of course, are the overestimators). Still, candidates are generally on the right track â itâs not like people who score a 4 are always giving themselves a 1.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;imposter-ref10&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.interviewing.io/impostor-syndrome-strikes-men-just-as-hard-as-women-and-other-findings-from-thousands-of-technical-interviews/#imposter-fn10&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Self-ratings &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; statistically significantly predictive for actual interview scores (and positively correlated), but that relationship is noisy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;The implications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accurately judging your own interview performance is a skill in its own right and one that engineers need to learn from experience and context in the tech industry. But weâve also learned that &lt;strong&gt;many of the assumptions we made about performance accuracy didnât hold up to scrutiny â&lt;/strong&gt; female engineers had just as accurate a view of their own skills as male ones, and engineers who had led more interviews or were well known on GitHub werenât particularly better at gauging their performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for the industry as a whole? First off, impostor syndrome appears to be the bleary-eyed monster that attacks across gender ability, and how good you are, or where you are, or how famous you are isnât that important. Seniority does help mitigate some of the pain, but impostor syndrome affects everyone, regardless of who they are or where theyâre from. So, maybe itâs time for a kinder, more empathetic interviewing culture. And a culture thatâs kinder to everyone, because though marginalized groups who havenât been socialized in technical interviewing are &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.interviewing.io/you-cant-fix-diversity-in-tech-without-fixing-the-technical-interview/&quot;&gt;hit the hardest by shortcomings in the interview process&lt;/a&gt;, no one is immune to self-doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weâve previously discussed what makes someone a good interviewer, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.interviewing.io/what-do-the-best-interviewers-have-in-common-we-looked-at-thousands-of-real-interviews-to-find-out/&quot;&gt;empathy plays a disproportionately large role&lt;/a&gt;. And weâve seen that &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.interviewing.io/people-are-still-bad-at-gauging-their-own-interview-performance-heres-the-data/&quot;&gt;providing immediate post-interview feedback is really important for keeping candidates from dropping out&lt;/a&gt;. So, whether youâre motivated by kindness and ideology or cold, hard pragmatism, a bit more kindness and understanding toward your candidates is in order.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Since Sunday afternoon, Iâve been in a whirlwind of meetings, discussions, and calls about IBMâs plan to acquire Red Hat for $34 billion. My mind has been racing but, after some consideration, Iâve decided to share my thoughts as a narrative timeline. Trust me when say that I have given this format considerable thought. It is likely the safest way (regulatory-wise) to deliver my thoughts on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like to point out that I have updated &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrisshort.net/terms/&quot;&gt;my &lt;strong&gt;disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt; and this siteâs terms&lt;/a&gt;. My views do not reflect those of my employer or entities Iâm affiliated with. Names are withheld for obvious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;at-least-it-wasn-t-oracle&quot;&gt;âAt least it wasnât Oracleâ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, October 29, 2018, I was watching my two older nephews play with Max at my youngest nephewâs baptism party when a Bloomberg alert popped up. My phone was on a coffee table, while I could make out that the alert was Bloomberg I couldnât read what it said. âBloomberg? On a Sunday? Huh.â I thought to myself. Picking up the phone I immediately notice it says something about Red Hat. I see the headline, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-28/ibm-is-said-to-near-deal-to-acquire-software-maker-red-hat&quot;&gt;IBM to Acquire Linux Distributor Red Hat for $33.4 Billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; data-ad-layout=&quot;in-article&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;fluid&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-8972983586873269&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;4663018952&quot;/&gt; &lt;p&gt;I opened the story, skimmed it, and got up to go find my wife, Julie. I show her the story. Julie knows IBM from living in Raleigh for a decade (not a good decade for IBM either). I donât recall exactly what she said or did but, it made me start looking for more information. While opening Inoreader an alert from Reuters came in, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-red-hat-m-a-ibm/ibm-nears-deal-to-acquire-cyber-security-company-red-hat-sources-idUSKCN1N20N3&quot;&gt;IBM nears deal to acquire cyber security company Red Hat: sources&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened Gmail so I could see what Red Hatâs stream of consciousness (aka memo-list) is saying; it was calm (only four e-mails, some wondering if itâs a hoax). Then Business Insider broke their story, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/ibm-is-reportedly-nearing-a-deal-to-acquire-redhat-the-software-company-valued-at-20-billion-2018-10&quot;&gt;ITâS OFFICIAL: IBM is acquiring software company Red Hat for $34 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an odd feeling. Like, maybe I could have said something knowing it wouldnât have mattered. It was a sensation of not even getting a chance to do something. In the span of 24 minutes, I went from having a pretty great day to having what was akin to a panic attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;âI have to get home,â I thought to myself. I made a hasty goodbye to the family and walk out the door. I sent the &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.ibm.com/2018-10-28-IBM-To-Acquire-Red-Hat-Completely-Changing-The-Cloud-Landscape-And-Becoming-Worlds-1-Hybrid-Cloud-Provider&quot;&gt;IBM press release&lt;/a&gt; to my boss to make sure she knew. I didnât know why I was driving home but, home was also the office and it felt like the right thing to do. If push came to shove I could get people up to speed as they popped up online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drive home was filled with nausea and worry. âI should get home and go straight down to the office and login,â I think to myself. My boss texts back, âHoly Shit!â I get home to a lot of notifications. My boss and I go back and forth for a minute vis text as Iâm walking inside. But, there wasnât much to be done. I took some anxiety meds and laid face down for a little bit on my bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; data-ad-layout=&quot;in-article&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;fluid&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-8972983586873269&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;4663018952&quot;/&gt; &lt;p&gt;A friend at Red Hat texts me asking if Iâd seen the news. I responded back that I had and wasnât feeling too great about it. You have to understand my experience with IBM. In 2015, I worked for a few weeks at a healthcare company that was a $1 billion dollar IBM acquisition. It was a total dumpster fire and IBM knew it. But, Watson Health was the future of IBM, a friend elsewhere in IBM had told me. Long story short, I saw a ton of cracks in the business that was bought for a ridiculous sum of money. I had to make a decision real quick and got out of Dodge. Earlier this year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/05/25/ibms_watson_layoffs/&quot;&gt;IBMâs Watson Health had huge layoffs&lt;/a&gt; and I felt very justified in my decision. My rash decision making might have hurt my career a little. But, I dodged a huge bullet in my first run in as an almost IBM employee. At the end of the brief discussion with my friend, he said, â&lt;strong&gt;At least it wasnât Oracle.&lt;/strong&gt;â My response, âYesâ¦ I really would have driven off the road then.â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;âIn 2018, dreams donât die slowly and fade away into nothing. Theyâre nuked from orbit.â âChris Short to a friend&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cra/status/1056671662073171970&quot;&gt;memo-list was a dumpster fire&lt;/a&gt;. I stopped looking at it altogether overnight. Monday morning brought a slew of meeting and all-hands calendar invites. A friend who went through a gnarly acquisition at NetApp calls. But, his Monday morning quarterbacking was pretty accurate. He gives some sage advice that calms my nerves but doesnât completely put me at ease. It was a start to calming down so Iâm incredibly thankful for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jim Whitehurst-Ginni Rometty all-hands was critically important for both Jim and Ginni to nail in front of the world. Their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/10/29/watch-the-full-interview-with-ibm-and-red-hat-ceos-on-33-billion-deal.html&quot;&gt;CNBC Squawk Box spot&lt;/a&gt; was decent but who knew how an auditorium full of Red Hatters would respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim walks out in his familiar jeans and crisp, white button down. Ginni walks out in purple. Turns out that later on in the presentation Arvind Krishna, IBMâs SVP of Hybrid Cloud and Director of Research, said he was wearing purple to show cohesion because red and blue make purple. Ginni said she didnât even realize she had done it (but was sure to point it out on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/29/ibm-ceo-red-hat-is-a-game-changer-makes-us-no-1-in-hybrid-cloud.html&quot;&gt;CNBCâs Mad Money&lt;/a&gt; that night). It was a very human moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; data-ad-layout=&quot;in-article&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;fluid&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-8972983586873269&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;4663018952&quot;/&gt; &lt;p&gt;The all-hands itself was good. Ginni donning a red fedora was a very nice touch. Also, whichever Red Hatter wrote âfuck youâ to Jim in the chat during the global all-hands, Iâm beyond disappointed in you. I pretty much had to close Twitter and avoid memo-list after the event. There was a lot of data and opinion to sort out. A snarky text comes in from a friend afterward, âNever thought Iâd see the day Chris Short worked for IBM.â I muted notifications for a while too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next all-hands was with my business unit leadership. They were very open, honest, and a smidge too excited. Long-time Red Hatters probably have a lot of stock thatâs going to vest at a nice premium (even after the acquisition news triggered a 50+ point bump). For those of us still reeling from the news itself and what the future may hold I decided to write an e-mail the BUâs leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;46.268774703557&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking the time today to talk and answer our questions. I asked flat out what my number one concern was for Red Hat and that is its people. I know that there is a large chunk of Red Hat, myself included, getting e-mails, phone calls, DMs, etc. this morning. Some of these are congratulatory, more are condolences, and others are flat out, âAre you going to be okay?â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metrics alone show this is a monumental event that could be life-changing. Iâm already feeling myself become less open as a result. Contra to Red Hat policies, I am self censoring more so than I have through other acquisitions because this is IBM. Iâm sharing press and stories but, Iâm not commenting, at all, where normally I would. I have thoughts and opinions on the topic and Iâm hesitant to discuss them as I donât know what IBMâs reaction will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please keep in mind, IBM has been building, for a decade or more, negative thoughts in peoples minds. Their own actions have affected friends and family negatively. I know companies exist to deliver value to investors. But, we live in a very different world. Red Hat was this shining beacon of hope for people. Peoplesâ hopes and dreams are on uncertain footing now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of us now have this fear of an IBM blue washing of Red Hat. Google has shown for years that, psychological safety is important to effective teams (&lt;a href=&quot;https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/&quot;&gt;https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/&lt;/a&gt;). Being as psychologically safe at a company as I am at Red Hat has never happened to me before. It has been liberating. I donât feel safe being as open as I was last week and this is the first twelve hours. Please help folks try to feel safe through this acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I told a friend I finally found a place to call home in Red Hat. That friend is now trying to recruit me away from Red Hat. As Iâm sure youâre painfully aware, the industry moves way faster than this acquisition ever will. Please keep that in mind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time and leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This e-mail captures the reality of Monday. Yes, my natural instinct to self-censor was working overtime. That was likely more legalities, fear, and doubt fueling that anxiety. It was an emotional and raw morning. A lot of folks around Red Hat were fielding calls on Sunday evening to jump ship. I know what itâs like when people are trying to lure you away. Itâs easy to be lured away from uncertainty (we are humans after all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day was pretty much derailed at that point. There wasnât much me or many others could do but respond to calls from folks, deflect recruiters, and side-eye the bejesus out of memo-list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;reaching-across-divides&quot;&gt;Reaching Across Divides&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had taken the mind overnight that the messaging seems to indicate that nothing earth-shattering was going to change for a while. Tuesday started off answering some DMs, texts, and e-mails. I mention this because of the time it takes to proofread every response. My modus operandi is open. Suddenly a restriction is put in place and it made me hyper-aware of what I was writing. It might have been unnecessary but, some messages were prying and others werenât. Never too careful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; data-ad-layout=&quot;in-article&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;fluid&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-8972983586873269&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;4663018952&quot;/&gt; &lt;p&gt;During a Marketing all-hands things seemed to quiet down a little. Then a funny thing started happening. IBMers started reaching out. They shared what their life at IBM was like. So I started reaching out to some IBMers I know. We all started talking. I spoke with one IBMer working from their home office in Virginia. One person spoke of a co-worker getting ordained to officiate a wedding of another IBMer. There were no folks reaching out from IBM saying, âPsst. Hey, man. RUN FOR YOUR LIFE! GO GET HELP!â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This spurred me to reach further out to see what other folks thought. I was reading journalist and analyst opinions but, I wasnât reaching out to other tech folks to see what they would do or what they thought. One Googler remarked it wasnât a great time to be at any big tech company. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/10/26/technology-and-the-us-military/&quot;&gt;Microsoft is playing JEDI&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/technology/google-walkout-sexual-harassment.html&quot;&gt;Google is getting walked out on&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-is-caught-in-an-ever-tightening-squeeze/&quot;&gt;Facebook ruined democracy somehow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/business/economy/amazon-workers-sears-bankruptcy-filing.html&quot;&gt;Amazon doesnât treat its workers well&lt;/a&gt;â¦ The list went on and on. If youâre not in turmoil and youâre at a tech company consider yourself lucky. Of all the situations the IBM/Red Hat situation was the best one to be in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;wednesday-war-planning&quot;&gt;Wednesday War Planning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âNo battle plan survives first contact with the enemy.â âHelmuth von Moltke the Elder&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time Wednesday rolled around my anxiety was gone. The plan was to sit tight, ride things through the acquisition, and try to turn IBM into the next Microsoft. On Sunday, when I announced to the family my company was being bought by IBM the looks on folks faces were different based on generation. The older the person, the happier they looked. I know my grandfather would be so happy to hear this news too. I think IBM wants to truly turn things around and fast. &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrisshort.net/microsoft-has-come-a-long-way/&quot;&gt;Microsoft Has Come a Long Way&lt;/a&gt; after all in becoming a place people want to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; data-ad-layout=&quot;in-article&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;fluid&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-8972983586873269&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;4663018952&quot;/&gt; &lt;p&gt;But, I need a way to figure out if there are canaries in the proverbial coal mine that will indicate to me itâs time to dust off the ole &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrisshort.net/resume/&quot;&gt;resume&lt;/a&gt;. Here are some scenarios that would be a red flag for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jim Whitehurst or Paul Cormier moving to anywhere but the IBM C-suite within twelve months of the acquisition closing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A re-org of Red Hat within twelve months of the acquisition closing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If IBMâs Open Source Participation Guidelines are not conducive to Red Hatâs way of business (especially if it somehow gets in my way somehow)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A handful of people (whom I will not name) leave between six months prior to or up to six months after the acquisition closing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also need to start figuring out what I want to be doing, day to day, in two years (yâallâ¦ Iâve been winging it since 2011). Indeed, I needed to figure out what I wanted to accomplish in 2019. This makes that exercise a little more urgent. It also needs to include a potential job move in early 2020. I hope it doesnât. I hope this is as good as it can be for IBM and Red Hat in their entireties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the short term (six to eighteen months), Iâm likely not going anywhere. There are always two or three companies that, if came calling, Iâd probably leave Red Hat before that. Red Hat is awesome and is still my dream company to work for. IBM has some incredibly smart people in the company like Red Hat does. It makes sense to stick around and work with a few of them if IBM does what they say theyâre going to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A huge thanks to all the wonderful people Iâve talked to this week. Youâve made a jarring change easier for me to manage mentally. I am forever grateful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake, this is a historic moment. Whether itâs the beginning or the end of a history is the big question.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Migrating away from Google Maps and cutting costs</title>
<link>https://www.eventsofa.de/campus/migrating-away-from-google-maps-and-cutting-costs-by-99/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.eventsofa.de/campus/migrating-away-from-google-maps-and-cutting-costs-by-99/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks for the discussion on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18390425#18390675&quot;&gt;HN&lt;/a&gt; and all the feedback. As pointed out by 255kb, there is a different pricing for place mode to put markers on addresses and places. Our customers often change the marker position though, as it doesnât reflect their understanding of their venue. If you only place a marker on an address, the Google price hike doesnât affect you probably.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;eventsofa is a location platform where you can find locations for your events, for example for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventsofa.de/weihnachtsfeier-ideen-berlin&quot;&gt;Christmas parties&lt;/a&gt;. Weâve been using Google Maps on profile pages for some years now and have been happy with the experience. Usage was free for us, reliability was high and there was a steady stream of new features and map enhancements. Beside Maps we were also using geo coding from Google, which was a much rougher experience from Google with mixed language and bad data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came the shock, Google wanted money for Google Maps usage. From a business point of view, we surely can understand Google wanting money for its services. We did budget away money as we were expecting this to come. But what shocked us was the increase in prices by more than 1000%. They wanted to sweeten the price hike with a monthly credit, but this was a raindrop in the ocean. The projected costs from Google were several thousands of euros per month, with an upward trend indicated by Google and also our seasonal business. .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We waited two months to see real prices on our invoice as we hoped to stay with Google. First thought for staying was cutting costs and migrating to static Google maps. But this looked more complicated than migrating our Javascript to a new Mapbox API. So during this time we looked around for some alternatives. There are many offerings from Here Maps, Azure Maps, Apple Maps, TomTom and many more. After looking at some data we decided to base our usage on an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openstreetmap.org/&quot;&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt; based service. OpenStreetMap is a great service and at least in Europe the quality of data is very high. When hiking or walking I usually use something based on OSM with its higher quality of small pathways and parks compared to Google Maps. We believe OSM is the future of mapping and wanted to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/www.eventsofa.de/campus/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MapExample.png?ssl=1&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-13577&quot; src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/www.eventsofa.de/campus/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MapExample.png?resize=696%2C423&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;423&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We soon narrowed down our search to &lt;a href=&quot;https://stadiamaps.com&quot;&gt;Stadiamaps&lt;/a&gt;. They have excellent pricing, good looking tiles, support the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/&quot;&gt;Mapbox API&lt;/a&gt; and as we learned have excellent support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migration was very easy and took much shorter than weâve expected. We decided to use the Mapbox API with &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.stadiamaps.com/themes/&quot;&gt;tiles from Stadiamaps&lt;/a&gt;. In under 30 minutes we migrated our code to Stadiamaps without prior knowledge of their API, including deployment. We saw an example to change the map marker and used it to create a pink marker, which we havenât done with Google Maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migration led to a reduction of costs of something around 95-99% depending on seasonal traffic. Although we have to pay now for map services, the cost isnât very high and very sustainable for us. We wish Google would have taken money from the beginning with a reasonable price we could budget instead of being free and then charging lots of money. StadiaMaps also energized us to put maps in several places we havenât used maps before!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things have not gone as well with geo coding. Google geo coding data is only allowed to be used with Google Maps, so when you change maps you need to migrate geo coding too and recode old data. We tested several geo coding services and are comparing results to Google geocoding to see how they perform. After some changes we now use Open Cage Data geocoding. Open Cage supports both JSON and XML formats and support forward and reverse geo coding. &lt;a href=&quot;https://opencagedata.com/tutorials/migrate-from-googlemaps&quot;&gt;One benefit is we now own the coding data&lt;/a&gt; and can use it in the future even if we change the maps service or geo coding provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Cage has better results than Google and supply more useful data with each response. You can get telephone code, currency, emoji flag of the country, coordinates in different formats, sun rise and sun set, time zone and many more. Results of city names and suburbs for different languages is also much better than with Google. We had some minor data issues and Open Cage Data support was excellent with very fast fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were using placeId in Google geocoding to show users a list of coding results, let the user select one and then use the selection to geocode a location. As most geo coding service weâve looked at didnât support unique IDs for geo coding results, we had to rewrite backend and frontend code. Which isnât as nice, but works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support from StadiaMaps during our decision and following the migration was excellent. Weâve exchanged some emails with Stadiamaps CEO who was very kind and helpful, overall the support experience was a pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Google for giving us free Maps for some years, weâre now very happy with Stadiamaps and should have migrated before!&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â C.A.R. Hoare, The 1980 ACM Turing Award Lecture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The computing scientistâs main challenge is not to get confused by the complexities of his own making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â E. W. Dijkstra&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cheapest, fastest, and most reliable components are those that arenât there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â Gordon Bell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my most productive days was throwing away 1000 lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â &lt;a href=&quot;http://genius.cat-v.org/ken-thompson/&quot;&gt;Ken Thompson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;When in doubt, use brute force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â &lt;a href=&quot;http://genius.cat-v.org/ken-thompson/&quot;&gt;Ken Thompson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deleted code is debugged code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â Jeff Sickel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt; Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â &lt;a href=&quot;http://genius.cat-v.org/brian-kernighan/&quot;&gt;Brian W. Kernighan&lt;/a&gt; and P. J. Plauger in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0070342075?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=catv-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0070342075&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elements of Programming Style&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most effective debugging tool is still careful thought, coupled with judiciously placed print statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â &lt;a href=&quot;http://genius.cat-v.org/brian-kernighan/&quot;&gt;Brian W. Kernighan&lt;/a&gt;, in the paper Unix for Beginners (1979)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â &lt;a href=&quot;http://genius.cat-v.org/brian-kernighan/&quot;&gt;Brian Kernighan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beauty is more important in computing than anywhere else in technology because software is so complicated. Beauty is the ultimate defence against complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â David Gelernter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNIX was not designed to stop its users from doing stupid things, as that would also stop them from doing clever things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â Doug Gwyn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If youâre willing to restrict the flexibility of your approach, you can almost always do something better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â John Carmack&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;And folks, letâs be honest. Sturgeon was an optimist. Way more than 90% of code is crap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â viro [http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0310.0/0870.html]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A data structure is just a stupid programming language.&lt;/p&gt;

Sigh... When it comes to software there are three systems of beliefs.
One of them:

    * Thou shalt know by your heart that all software sucks.
    * Beware of those who say that their software does not suck, for they
      are either fools or liars.
    * Beware of those who give you garments and do not allow to mend them,
      for sooner or later thou shalt find what needs mending.
    * But beware also of those who give you badly rotten garments and say
      &quot;Thou shalt prefer that above everything, for thou art allowed to
      mend it&quot;.
    * Thou shalt not treat software as a living being, for it is not one.
    * Choose a license of thine liking for sofware thou writest and do not
      blame those who choose differently for software they write.
    * Know when to say &quot;It can be mended, I shalt do that&quot; and when to
      say &quot;It is rotten beyond repair&quot;.
    * Choose free over non-free when it is better or when thou art willing
      to fix what is broken.
    * When shit happens, think how to fix it.

Another:

    * All software wants to be free
    * Thou shalt not use non-free software
    * Thou shalt not mention non-free software
    * Thou shalt make all thine software free
    * Thou shalt choose free above working, even if free one is broken
      beyond repair
    * When shit happens, add new features

and the last one:

    * Our 3133t! K3wl! Software! Does Not Suck!!!
    * Always choose our software above everything else
    * When shit happens, we add new features

If you happen to believe in second variant, you have my condolence as
long as you don't force your beliefs on everybody else. If you choose
to emulate door-to-door pests^H^H^H^Hreachers - don't expect to be
treated differently.
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;People do have a right to put their code under whatever license they like. Now, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; wonât use the stuff I donât have a source for unless I have exceptionally good reason to believe that authors of that stuff are among the few percents of programmers who &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; find their arse without outside help. But that has nothing to do with licensing or any moral considerations and everything to the fact that I know what kind of crap most of the software is.&lt;/p&gt;

If you give me the right kind of Tinker Toys, I can imagine the building. I can sit there and see primitives and recognize their power to build structures a half mile high, if only I had just one more to make it functionally complete. I can see those kinds of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The converse is true, too, I think. I canât from the building imagine the Tinker Toys. When I see a top-down description of a system or language that has infinite libraries described by layers and layers, all I just see is a morass. I canât get a feel for it. I canât understand how the pieces fit; I canât understand something presented to me thatâs very complex. Maybe I do what I do because if I built anything more complicated, I couldnât understand it. I really must break it down into little pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody should start to undertake a large project. You start with a small trivial project, and you should never expect it to get large. If you do, youâll just overdesign and generally think it is more important than it likely is at that stage. Or worse, you might be scared away by the sheer size of the work you envision. So start small, and think about the details. Donât think about some big picture and fancy design. If it doesnât solve some fairly immediate need, itâs almost certainly over-designed. And donât expect people to jump in and help you. Thatâs not how these things work. You need to get something half-way useful first, and then others will say âhey, that almost works for meâ, and theyâll get involved in the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A computer is a stupid machine with the ability to do incredibly smart things, while computer programmers are smart people with the ability to do incredibly stupid things. They are, in short, a perfect match&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: What is the most often-overlooked risk in software engineering?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Incompetent programmers. There are estimates that the number of programmers needed in the U.S. exceeds 200,000. This is entirely misleading. It is not a quantity problem; we have a quality problem. One bad programmer can easily create two new jobs a year. Hiring more bad programmers will just increase our perceived need for them. If we had more good programmers, and could easily identify them, we would need fewer, not more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â David Parnas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well over half of the time you spend working on a project (on the order of 70 percent) is spent thinking, and no tool, no matter how advanced, can think for you. Consequently, even if a tool did everything except the thinking for you â if it wrote 100 percent of the code, wrote 100 percent of the documentation, did 100 percent of the testing, burned the CD-ROMs, put them in boxes, and mailed them to your customers â the best you could hope for would be a 30 percent improvement in productivity. In order to do better than that, you have to change the way you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best code is no code at all.&lt;/p&gt;

Trying to improve software quality by increasing the amount of testing is like trying to lose weight by weighing yourself more often. What you eat before you step onto the scale determines how much you will weigh, and the software development techniques you use determine how many errors testing will find. If you want to lose weight, donât buy a new scale; change your diet. If you want to improve your software, donât test more; develop better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Correctness is clearly the prime quality. If a system does not do what it is supposed to do, then everything else about it matters little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary duty of an exception handler is to get the error out of the lap of the programmer and into the surprised face of the user. Provided you keep this cardinal rule in mind, you canât go far wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as we started programming, we found to our surprise that it wasnât as easy to get programs right as we had thought. Debugging had to be discovered. I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you want to do something differently from the rest of the world, itâs a good idea to look into whether the rest of the world knows something you donât.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;â¦ what society overwhelmingly asks for is snake oil. Of course, the snake oil has the most impressive names â otherwise you would be selling nothing â like âStructured Analysis and Designâ, âSoftware Engineeringâ, âMaturity Modelsâ, âManagement Information Systemsâ, âIntegrated Project Support Environmentsâ âObject Orientationâ and âBusiness Process Re-engineeringâ (the latter three being known as IPSE, OO and BPR, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comment about developers making work for themselves is also spot on. I answer a lot of programming questions, and the questions are always asked because the programmer has reached the end of a twisty maze of his own creation. Turn around, walk, spin around, and try again. Youâll find a better solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â Jonathan Rockway in a Hacker News comment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;a program is like a poem: you cannot write a poem without writing it. Yet people talk about programming as if it were a production process and measure âprogrammer productivity&quot;in terms of &quot;number of lines of code producedâ.In so doing they book that number on the wrong side of the ledger: We should always refer to&quot;the number of lines of code spent&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â E. W. Dijkstra&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;itâs an old observation that in order to be useful hypothesis has to be falsifiable. Similar principle applies to design proposals - to be worth of any attention they have to be detailed enough to allow meaningful criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you have done so far is equivalent to coming to a hospital and saying âaseptic good, infection badâ. That would get pretty much the same reactions, varying from âyes, we knowâ to âdo you have any specific suggestions?â and âstop wasting our timeâ[1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short: get lost and do not come back until you have something less vague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some of the types of problems engineers at REAL software shops have to solve to be able to ship REAL product for REAL money. If you havenât HAD to produce code like this yourself at some point in your carrier then youâve lived a sheltered life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its disingenuous for you to get on your ivory tower to point and laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, you see, after spending years cleaning up the excrements of self-styled âREAL engineersâ itâs either get on the tower to point and laugh or get on the tower to point and shoot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;âLayered approachâ is not a magic incantation to excuse any bit of snake oil. Homeopathic remedies might not harm (pure water is pure water), but thatâs not an excuse for quackery.

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beauty of small and simple code is that you can bend or break the rules as long it stays small and simple. Rules allow people to write code without thinking. [And when] you dont think [â¦] you get bloated code that just concatenates stupid patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such is modern computing: everything simple is made too complicated because itâs easy to fiddle with; everything complicated stays complicated because itâs hard to fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears to be true: A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;âdesign patternsâ are concepts used by people who canât learn by any method except memorization, so in place of actual programming ability, they memorize âpatternsâ and throw each one in sequence at a problem until it works&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normal people believe that if it ainât broke, donât fix it. Engineers believe that if it ainât broke, it doesnât have enough features yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;And donât EVER make the mistake that you can design something better than what you get from ruthless massively parallel trial-and-error with a feedback cycle. Thatâs giving your intelligence &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; too much credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ixJLLbP8Is&quot;&gt;Watch the video review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hardly ever think about my Mac Mini, but it serves a vital role for my family as our &lt;a href=&quot;https://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/&quot;&gt;home-theater mixer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plex.tv/&quot;&gt;Plex&lt;/a&gt; server, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fujitsu.com/us/products/computing/peripheral/scanners/scansnap/&quot;&gt;ScanSnap&lt;/a&gt; server, Apple Photos backup, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/atp.html&quot;&gt;Backblaze&lt;/a&gt; host for our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.synology.com/en-us&quot;&gt;NAS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:pQF3OuDFd1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marco.org/2018/11/06/mac-mini-2018-review#fn:pQF3OuDFd1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Almost every port on the back is in use, and it runs 24/7, reliably, in total silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until last week, I thought it would be the last Mac Mini that Apple ever made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when rumors started swirling about an imminent Mac Mini update, I assumed the worst: if it came at all, it would be a tiny box with a slow, ultra-low-power processor and almost zero ports, optimizing for small size instead of versatility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I donât think this was an unreasonable fear after the 2014 Mac Mini update, which made many key aspects much worse without making anything much better. It seemed clear then, and for the following &lt;strong&gt;four years&lt;/strong&gt; that it went without an update, that Apple held the Mac Mini and its customers in very low regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2018 Mac Mini is real, and itâs spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes almost nothing worse and almost everything better, finally bringing the Mac Mini into the modern age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://marco.org/media/2018/11/macmini-ports.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;Ports! Glorious ports!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number one â and this is a big one these days, especially for this product â is that itâs not any &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; useful or versatile than the outgoing Mac Mini, including the generous assortment of ports. If the previous one served a role for you, the new one can probably do it just as well, and probably better and faster, with minimal donglage.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:pQF3OuDFd2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marco.org/2018/11/06/mac-mini-2018-review#fn:pQF3OuDFd2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itâs the same size as the old one, which is the right tradeoff. I know zero Mac Mini owners who really need it to get smaller, and many who donât want it to get fewer ports or worse performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of the Mac Mini is to be as versatile as possible, addressing lots of diverse and edge-case needs that the other Macs canât with their vastly different form factors and more opinionated designs. The Mac Mini needs to be a utility product, not a design statement. (Although, even as someone tired of space-gray everything, I have to admit that the Mini looks fantastic in its new color.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base price has increased to $800, and thatâs not great. Itâs partly justifiable because itâs much higher-end than before â the processors are &lt;strong&gt;much&lt;/strong&gt; better, the architecture is higher-end and includes big advances like the T2, and all-SSD is standard â but itâs still an expensive product in absolute terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple lent me a high-end configuration for review â 6-core i7, 32 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD â which would cost $2499 (much of which is the SSD). This wouldâve sounded crazy to spend on a Mac Mini a few years ago, but when itâs specced up like this, itâs targeting a much higher-end market than the previous model could. Compared to similarly specced iMacs and MacBook Pros, the pricing is generally reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this can truly be a pro desktop, with just one exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Benchmarks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big story to me is how incredibly &lt;strong&gt;fast&lt;/strong&gt; this thing is. Granted, Iâm testing the fastest CPU offered, but &lt;strong&gt;damn&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;reviewgraph&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marco.org/media/2018/11/macmini-geekbench.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://marco.org/media/2018/11/macmini-geekbench.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geekbench.com/&quot;&gt;Geekbench&lt;/a&gt; results are very strong. The i7 Mac Mini scored better on single-core performance than &lt;a href=&quot;https://browser.geekbench.com/mac-benchmarks&quot;&gt;every other Mac today (!)&lt;/a&gt; at 5912, and its multi-core score of nearly 24,740 beats every Mac to date except the iMac Pro and the old 12-core 2013 Mac Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âPerformance-competitive with pro Macsâ was not high on my prediction list for a Mac Mini update, but here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;reviewgraph&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marco.org/media/2018/11/macmini-xcode.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://marco.org/media/2018/11/macmini-xcode.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the rate of CPU advancement has slowed dramatically over the last few years, Apple has found other ways to improve performance. The T2 is great for lots of &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/apple-t2-security-chip-microphone-eavesdropping/&quot;&gt;security&lt;/a&gt; reasons â I wouldnât buy a new Mac these days without it â but what youâre seeing here is its strength as a ridiculously fast SSD controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Mac Mini builds my app, &lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/&quot;&gt;Overcast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;much&lt;/strong&gt; faster than my maxed-out 13-inch MacBook Pro, and about as quickly as my 10-core iMac Pro! Obviously, to achieve this result with only 6 cores, itâs not maxing out the CPU 100% of the time â it hits it in bursts while juggling a lot between the SSD and memory â but the result is that itâs incredibly fast as a development machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;reviewgraph&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marco.org/media/2018/11/macmini-blackmagic.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://marco.org/media/2018/11/macmini-blackmagic.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blackmagic-disk-speed-test/id425264550&quot;&gt;Blackmagick Disk Speed Test&lt;/a&gt; shows that the raw SSD performance is effectively identical to the other T2 Macs shipped to date, and a huge improvement over the four-year-old Mac Mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;reviewgraph&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marco.org/media/2018/11/macmini-ffmpeg.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://marco.org/media/2018/11/macmini-ffmpeg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people use Mac Minis as media or Plex servers, so I ran an H.265 transcoding test with &lt;code&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/code&gt;. This maxes out all CPU cores, so the results predictably scale with the core count: the 6-core Mac Mini was much faster than the 4-core MacBook Pro, but the 10-core iMac Pro beat them both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if an app supports the T2âs hardware HEVC encoder,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:pQF3OuDFdhevc&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marco.org/2018/11/06/mac-mini-2018-review#fn:pQF3OuDFdhevc&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; it can go &lt;strong&gt;much&lt;/strong&gt; faster. And since every T2 so far performs identically, all T2 machines â from the 2018 MacBook Air to the iMac Pro â encode HEVC this way at the same speed, and all in complete silence because theyâre barely touching the CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasnât able to notice any quality differences between the videos encoded with &lt;code&gt;x265&lt;/code&gt; and the T2âs hardware acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;reviewgraph&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marco.org/media/2018/11/macmini-opencl.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://marco.org/media/2018/11/macmini-opencl.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only spec that lets it down is the Intel GPU. Itâs fast enough for common tasks, but if your workload benefits from a strong GPU, youâre better off going for an iMac or a 15-inch MacBook Pro, or considering an eGPU setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Mac lines rely on Intelâs integrated GPUs to fit their physical and thermal needs, and Intel has been incredibly inconsistent over the last few years in delivering updated CPU-GPU combinations that would be suitable for many Macs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often blame Intelâs CPU roadmap (or Appleâs seeming indifference) for the lack of updates to certain Mac lines, but Intelâs GPU offerings are often the bigger issue. This is Intelâs fault, but itâs Appleâs problem âÂ and Apple passes that problem right along to its customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But thatâs it â aside from price, thatâs the only downside. The GPU sucks. Everything else is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you donât need a strong GPU âÂ and honestly, most Mac Mini use-cases donât â this is a solid pick for a general-purpose Mac, even at the base-level configuration. Spec it up, and itâs more like a mini-Mac Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few assorted notes, with apologies for stealing &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/2018/11/the_2018_ipad_pros&quot;&gt;Gruberâs&lt;/a&gt; format:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;8.3139730639731&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;7.5949367088608&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itâs silent at idle. The i7âs fan noise does become clearly audible when itâs under heavy load: itâs in the ballpark of a modern MacBook Pro, but quieter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://marco.org/2018/07/31/mac-low-power-mode&quot;&gt;disabled Turbo Boost&lt;/a&gt; to simulate the base i3 modelâs thermals, and couldnât get the fan to spin up audibly, no matter what I did. Those who prioritize silence under heavy loads should probably stick with the i3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the first non-iMac desktop Mac that lets you plug in a 5K display, at full quality, without dual cables or other unreliable hacks. We finally have 5K Retina Mac options beyond the iMac! Unfortunately, we still donât have any great standalone 5K displays. (The LG UltraFine isnât.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;8.8917835671343&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can upgrade the RAM again! I &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; wouldâve guessed this was coming, and I believe itâs the first time in a &lt;strong&gt;long&lt;/strong&gt; time that an Apple productâs direct successor became &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt; upgradeable and serviceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still recommend getting it with the right amount of RAM from Apple if possible, since third-party RAM has historically been a mess of unreliability and finger-pointing, but if you need that, itâs back. (The security screws inside â TR6? â still need some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/&quot;&gt;iFixit&lt;/a&gt; tools to get past.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;I Canât Believe The Mac Mini Is This Awesome, I Canât Even Say âAgainâ Because It Never Was&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new Mac Mini couldâve been so much worse. At many times in its past, it has seemed unloved, neglected, and downright punitive â a similar pattern to Appleâs other headless desktop, the Mac Pro. It seemed for a while that Apple lacked any interest in making Macs anymore, especially desktops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, with the introduction of the absolutely stellar iMac Pro, Apple showed us a glimpse of a potential new direction. It was downright perfect â a love letter to the Mac and its pro desktop users, and a clear turnaround in the way the company views the Mac for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didnât know until now whether the iMac Proâs greatness was a fluke. But now we have another data point: the last two desktops out of Apple have been incredible. After this, I have faith that theyâre going to do the new Mac Pro justice when it finally ships next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Mac Mini is a great update, out of nowhere, to a product we thought would never be updated again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, with Appleâs track record on the Mac Mini, it may never be updated after this. This is either the first in a series of regular updates with which Apple proves that they care about the Mac Mini again, or itâs the last Mac Mini that will ever exist and weâll all be hoarding them in a few years. We canât know yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But today, this is a great update, a wonderful all-arounder for lots of potential needs, and just a fantastic little computer.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>VMware acquires Heptio, the startup founded by 2 co-founders of Kubernetes</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/06/vmware-acquires-heptio-the-startup-founded-by-2-co-founders-of-kubernetes/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;During its big customer event in Europe, &lt;a href=&quot;http://VMware.com&quot;&gt;VMware&lt;/a&gt; announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.vmware.com/cloudnative/2018/11/06/welcome-heptio/&quot;&gt;another acquisition&lt;/a&gt; to step up its game in helping enterprises build and run containerised, Kubernetes-based architectures: it has acquired &lt;a href=&quot;https://heptio.com/&quot;&gt;Heptio&lt;/a&gt;, a startup out of Seattle that was co-founded byÂ Joe Beda and Craig McLuckie, who were two of the three people who co-created Kubernetes back at Google in 2014 (it has since been open sourced).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beda and McLuckie and their team will all be joining &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/vmware&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;vmware&quot;&gt;VMware&lt;/a&gt; in the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terms of the deal are not being disclosed â VMware said in a release that they are not material to the company â but as a point of reference, when &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/heptio&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;heptio&quot;&gt;Heptio&lt;/a&gt; last raised money â a &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/13/heptio-raises-25m-series-b-to-help-bring-cloud-native-computing-to-the-enterprise/&quot;&gt;$25 million Series B in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, with investors including Lightspeed, Accel and Madrona â it was valued at $117 million post-money, according to data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/168265-18/company/profile#timeline&quot;&gt;PitchBook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the pedigree of Heptioâs founders, this is a signal of the big bet that VMware is taking on &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/kubernetes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;kubernetes&quot;&gt;Kubernetes,&lt;/a&gt; and the belief that it will become an increasing cornerstone in how enterprises run their businesses. The larger company already works withÂ 500,000+ customers globally, and 75,000 partners. Itâs not clear how many customers Heptio worked with but they included large, tech-forward businesses like Yahoo Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itâs also another endorsement of the ongoing rise of open source and its role in cloud architectures, a paradigm that got its biggest boost at the end of October with &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/28/ibm-to-buy-red-hat-for-34b-in-cash-and-debt-taking-a-bigger-leap-into-hybrid-cloud/&quot;&gt;IBMâs acquisition of RedHat&lt;/a&gt;, one of the biggest tech acquisitions of all time at $34 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heptio providesÂ professional services for enterprises that are adopting or already use Kubernetes, providing training, support and building open-source projects for managing specific aspects of Kubernetes and related container clusters, and this deal is about VMware expanding the business funnel and margins for Kubernetes within it its wider cloud, on-premise and hybrid storage and computing services with that expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âKubernetes is emerging as an open framework for multi-cloud infrastructure that enables enterprise organizations to run modern applications,â said Paul Fazzone, senior vice president and general manager, Cloud Native Apps Business Unit, VMware, in a statement. âHeptio products and services will reinforce and extend VMwareâs efforts with PKS to establish Kubernetes as the de facto standard for infrastructure across clouds upon closing. We are thrilled that the Heptio team led by Craig and Joe will be joining VMware to help us guide customers as they move to a multi-cloud world.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VMware and its Pivotal business already offer Kubernetes-related services by way of PKS, which lets organizations run cloud-agnostic apps. Heptio will become a part of that wider portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âThe team at Heptio has been focused on Kubernetes, creating products that make it easier to manage multiple clusters across multiple clouds,â said Craig McLuckie, CEO and co-founder of Heptio. âAnd now we will be tapping into VMwareâs cloud native resources and proven ability to execute, amplifying our impact. VMwareâs interest in Heptio is a recognition that there is so much innovation happening in open source. We are jointly committed to contribute even more to the communityâresources, ideas and support.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VMware has made some 33 acquisitions overall, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/vmware/acquisitions/acquisitions_list#section-acquisitions&quot;&gt;Crunchbase&lt;/a&gt;, but this appears to have been the first specifically to boost its position in Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal is expected to close by fiscal Q4 2019, VMware said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Mystery Math Whiz and Novelist Advance Permutation Problem</title>
<link>https://www.quantamagazine.org/sci-fi-writer-greg-egan-and-anonymous-math-whiz-advance-permutation-problem-20181105/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.quantamagazine.org/sci-fi-writer-greg-egan-and-anonymous-math-whiz-advance-permutation-problem-20181105/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;On September 16, 2011, an anime fan posted a math question to the online bulletin board 4chan about the cult classic television series &lt;em&gt;The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya&lt;/em&gt;. Season one of the show, which involves time travel, had originally aired in nonchronological order, and a re-broadcast and a DVD version had each further rearranged the episodes. Fans were arguing online about the best order to watch the episodes, and the 4chan poster wondered: If viewers wanted to see the series in every possible order, what is the shortest list of episodes theyâd have to watch?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In less than an hour, an anonymous person offered an answer â not a complete solution, but a lower bound on the number of episodes required. The argument, which covered series with any number of episodes, showed that for the 14-episode first season of &lt;em&gt;Haruhi&lt;/em&gt;, viewers would have to watch at least 93,884,313,611 episodes to see all possible orderings. âPlease look over [the proof] for any loopholes I might have missed,â the anonymous poster wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proof slipped under the radar of the mathematics community for seven years â apparently only one professional mathematician spotted it at the time, and he didnât check it carefully. But in a plot twist last month, the Australian science fiction novelist &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/32699.Greg_Egan&quot;&gt;Greg Egan&lt;/a&gt; proved a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gregegan.net/SCIENCE/Superpermutations/Superpermutations.html&quot;&gt;upper bound&lt;/a&gt; on the number of episodes required. Eganâs discovery renewed interest in the problem and drew attention to the lower bound posted anonymously in 2011. Both proofs are now being hailed as significant advances on a puzzle mathematicians have been studying for at least 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathematicians quickly verified Eganâs upper bound, which, like the lower bound, applies to series of any length. Then Robin Houston, a mathematician at the data visualization firm Kiln, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://jaypantone.com/&quot;&gt;Jay Pantone&lt;/a&gt; of Marquette University in Milwaukee independently verified the work of the anonymous 4chan poster. âIt took a lot of work to try to figure out whether or not it was correct,â Pantone said, since the key ideas hadnât been expressed particularly clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Houston and Pantone, joined by &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.clas.ufl.edu/vatter/&quot;&gt;Vince Vatter&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Florida in Gainesville, have written up the formal argument. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;amp;pid=forums&amp;amp;srcid=MTUwMTUxMjExNDk4NTk5NjY5OTkBMDMxNDgwMTA5ODA5OTYyNzcyNDQBVF9leXJHY19Dd0FKATAuMQEBdjI&amp;amp;authuser=0&quot;&gt;their paper&lt;/a&gt;, they list the first author as âAnonymous 4chan Poster.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âItâs a weird situation that this very elegant proof of something that wasnât previously known was posted in such an unlikely place,â Houston said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Permutation Cities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a television series has just three episodes, there are six possible orders in which to view them: 123, 132, 213, 231, 312 and 321. You could string these six sequences together to give a list of 18 episodes that includes every ordering, but thereâs a much more efficient way to do it: 123121321. A sequence like this one that contains every possible rearrangement (or permutation) of a collection of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; symbols is called a âsuperpermutation.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1993, &lt;a href=&quot;http://eldar.mathstat.uoguelph.ca/dashlock/&quot;&gt;Daniel Ashlock&lt;/a&gt; and Jenett Tillotson &lt;a href=&quot;https://zbmath.org/?format=complete&amp;amp;q=an:0801.05004&quot;&gt;observed&lt;/a&gt; that if you look at the shortest superpermutations for different values of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;, a pattern quickly seems to emerge involving factorials â those numbers, written in the form &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;!, that involve multiplying together all the numbers up to &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; (for example, 4! = 4 Ã 3Â  Ã 2 Ã 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your series has just one episode, the shortest superpermutation has length 1! (also known as plain old 1). For a two-episode series, the shortest superpermutation (121) has length 2! + 1!. For three episodes (the example we looked at above), the length works out to 3! + 2! + 1!, and for four episodes (123412314231243121342132413214321), it is 4! + 3! + 2! + 1!. The factorial rule for superpermutations became conventional wisdom (even though no one could prove it was true for every value of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;), and mathematicians later confirmed it for &lt;em&gt;nÂ &lt;/em&gt;= 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in 2014, Houston startled mathematicians by &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5108&quot;&gt;showing that for &lt;em&gt;nÂ &lt;/em&gt;= 6&lt;/a&gt;, the pattern breaks down. The factorial rule predicts that to watch six episodes in every possible order should require 873 episodes, but Houston found a way to do it in 872. And since there is a simple way to convert a short superpermutation on &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; symbols into a short superpermutation on &lt;em&gt;nÂ &lt;/em&gt;+ 1 symbols, Houstonâs example meant that the factorial rule fails for every value of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; above 6 too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Houstonâs construction works by translating the superpermutation problem into the famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/traveling-salesman-problem/&quot;&gt;traveling salesman problem&lt;/a&gt;, which looks for the shortest route through a collection of cities. More specifically, superpermutations are connected to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/one-way-salesman-finds-fast-path-home-20171005/&quot;&gt;âasymmetricâ traveling salesman problem&lt;/a&gt;, in which each path between two cities has a cost (which is not necessarily the same in both directions), and the goal is to find the least expensive route through all the cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The translation is simple: Think of each permutation as a âcityâ and imagine a path from each permutation to each other permutation. In the superpermutation problem, we want the shortest possible sequence of digits that lists all the permutations, so the goal is to travel through the permutations in a way that adds as few digits to the starting permutation as possible. So we declare the cost of each path to be simply the number of digits we have to attach to the end of the first permutation to get the second one. In the &lt;em&gt;nÂ &lt;/em&gt;= 3 example, for instance, the path from 231 to 312 costs $1, since we just have to add a 2 to the end of 231 to get 312, while the path from 231 to 132 costs $2, since we have to add a 32. With this setup, the least-expensive path through the cities corresponds directly to the shortest superpermutation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This translation meant that Houston could turn the power of traveling salesman algorithms on the superpermutation problem. The traveling salesman problem is famous as an NP-hard problem, meaning that thereâs no efficient algorithm that can solve all cases of it. But there are algorithms that can solve some cases efficiently, and other algorithms that produce good approximate solutions. Houston used one of the latter to produce his 872-digit superpermutation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since he produced only an approximate solution, it might not be the very best superpermutation. Mathematicians are now conducting a giant computer search for the shortest superpermutation on six symbols, Pantone said. âWe know our search will finish in finite time, but donât know if thatâs one week or a million years,â he said. âThereâs no progress bar.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Wrong Order&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time of Houstonâs work, the anonymous 4chan post had been sitting in its corner of the internet for nearly three years. One mathematician, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.njohnston.ca/&quot;&gt;Nathaniel Johnston&lt;/a&gt; of Mount Allison University, had noticed a copy of the post on a different website a few days after it was posted â not because he was an anime fan, but because he had typed an assortment of superpermutation-related search terms into Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnston read the argument and thought it seemed plausible, but he didnât invest much effort in checking it carefully. At the time, mathematicians believed that the factorial formula for superpermutations was probably correct, and when you think you know the exact answer to a question, a lower bound isnât very interesting. In other words, the superpermutation research episodes were playing out of order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnston later mentioned the lower bound on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.njohnston.ca/2013/04/the-minimal-superpermutation-problem/&quot;&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://oeis.org/A180632&quot;&gt;websites&lt;/a&gt;, but âI donât think anyone really gave it any particular heed,â Houston said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then on September 26 of this year, the mathematician &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt; of the University of California, Riverside, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/johncarlosbaez/status/1045084142151450624&quot;&gt;posted on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; about Houstonâs 2014 finding, as part of a series of tweets about apparent mathematical patterns that fail. His tweet caught the eye of Egan, who was a mathematics major decades ago, before he launched an award-winning career as a science fiction novelist (his breakthrough 1994 novel, in a happy coincidence, was called &lt;em&gt;Permutation City&lt;/em&gt;). âIâve never stopped being interested in [mathematics],â Egan wrote by email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egan wondered if it was possible to construct superpermutations even shorter than Houstonâs. He scoured the literature for papers on how to construct short paths through permutation networks, and after a few weeks found exactly what he needed. Within a day or two, he had come up with a new upper bound on the length of the shortest superpermutation for &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; symbols: &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;! + (&lt;em&gt;nÂ âÂ &lt;/em&gt;1)! + (&lt;em&gt;nÂ âÂ &lt;/em&gt;2)! + (&lt;em&gt;nÂ â&lt;/em&gt;Â 3)! + &lt;em&gt;nÂ âÂ &lt;/em&gt;3. Itâs similar to the old factorial formula, but with many terms removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âIt absolutely smashed the [previous] upper bound,â Houston said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anonymous 4chan posterâs lower bound, meanwhile, was tantalizingly close to the new upper bound: It works out to &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;! + (&lt;em&gt;nÂ âÂ &lt;/em&gt;1)! + (&lt;em&gt;nÂ âÂ &lt;/em&gt;2)! + &lt;em&gt;nÂ âÂ &lt;/em&gt;3. When Eganâs result became public, Johnston reminded other mathematicians about the anonymous posterâs proof, and Houston and Pantone soon showed it was correct. As with Houstonâs work, the new lower and upper bounds both come at superpermutations via the traveling salesman problem: The lower bound shows that a route through all the cities must travel along some minimum number of paths that cost more than $1, while the upper bound constructs a specific route for each &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; that uses only $1 and $2 connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers are now trying to bring the upper and lower bounds together to find a single formula that solves the superpermutation problem. âProbably people are eventually going to completely nail down this puzzle,â Baez predicted. âItâs looking good now.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;em&gt;Haruhi&lt;/em&gt; fans, Eganâs construction gives explicit instructions for how to watch all possible orderings of season one in just 93,924,230,411 episodes. Viewers could start binge-watching immediately, or they could wait and see whether mathematicians can whittle this number down. The anonymous posterâs lower bound proves that this whittling down couldnât possibly save more than about 40 million episodes â but thatâs enough to get a nice start on season two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;what rr does&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;rr aspires to be your primary C/C++ debugging tool for Linux, replacing â well, enhancing â gdb. You record a failure once, then debug the recording, deterministically, as many times as you want. The same execution is replayed every time.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;rr also provides efficient reverse execution under gdb. Set breakpoints and data watchpoints and quickly reverse-execute to where they were hit.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;rr works on real applications and is used &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla/rr/wiki/Testimonials&quot;&gt;by many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chandlerc1024/status/879962014860193792&quot;&gt;developers&lt;/a&gt; to fix real bugs. It makes debugging hard bugs much easier, but also speeds up debugging of easy bugs.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;rr features:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low overhead compared to other similar tools, especially on mostly-single-threaded workloads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports recording and replay of all kinds of applications: Firefox, Chrome, QEMU, LibreOffice, Go programs, ...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Record, replay and debug multiple-process workloads, including entire containers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Works with gdb scripting and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla/rr/wiki/Using-rr-in-an-IDE&quot;&gt;IDE integration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://robert.ocallahan.org/2016/02/introducing-rr-chaos-mode.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chaos mode&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to make intermittent bugs more reproducible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;the rr debugging experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section readability=&quot;61&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by using rr to record your application:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ rr record /your/application --args
...
FAIL: oh no!
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire execution, including the failure, was saved to disk. That recording can now be debugged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ rr replay
GNU gdb (GDB) ...
...
0x4cee2050 in _start () from /lib/ld-linux.so.2
(gdb)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, you're debugging the &lt;em&gt;recorded trace&lt;/em&gt; deterministically; &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a live, nondeterministic execution. The replayed execution's address spaces, register contents, syscall data etc are exactly the same in every run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the common gdb commands can be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
(gdb) break mozilla::dom::HTMLMediaElement::HTMLMediaElement
...
(gdb) continue
Continuing.
...
Breakpoint 1, mozilla::dom::HTMLMediaElement::HTMLMediaElement (this=0x61362f70, aNodeInfo=...)
...
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need to restart the debugging session, for example because you missed breaking on some critical execution point, no problem. Just use gdb's &lt;code&gt;run&lt;/code&gt; command to restart replay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
(gdb) run
The program being debugged has been started already.
Start it from the beginning? (y or n) y
...
Breakpoint 1, mozilla::dom::HTMLMediaElement::HTMLMediaElement (this=0x61362f70, aNodeInfo=...)
...
(gdb) 
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;run&lt;/code&gt; command started another replay run of your recording from the beginning. But after the session restarted, the &lt;em&gt;same execution&lt;/em&gt; was replayed again. And all your debugging state was preserved across the restart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; pointer of the dynamically-allocated object was the same in both replay sessions. Memory allocations are exactly the same in each replay, meaning you can hard-code addresses you want to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more powerful is reverse execution. Suppose we're debugging Firefox layout:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Breakpoint 1, nsCanvasFrame::BuildDisplayList (this=0x2aaadd7dbeb0, aBuilder=0x7fffffffaaa0, aDirtyRect=..., aLists=...)
    at /home/roc/mozilla-inbound/layout/generic/nsCanvasFrame.cpp:460
460   if (GetPrevInFlow()) {
(gdp) p mRect.width
12000
&lt;/pre&gt;
We happen to know that that value is wrong. We want to find out where it was set. rr makes that quick and easy.
&lt;pre&gt;
(gdb) watch -l mRect.width
(gdb) reverse-cont
Continuing.
Hardware watchpoint 2: -location mRect.width
Old value = 12000
New value = 11220
0x00002aaab100c0fd in nsIFrame::SetRect (this=0x2aaadd7dbeb0, aRect=...)
    at /home/roc/mozilla-inbound/layout/base/../generic/nsIFrame.h:718
718       mRect = aRect;
&lt;/pre&gt;
This combination of hardware data watchpoints with reverse execution is extremely powerful!&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2&gt;video&lt;/h2&gt;

sudo dpkg -i rr-&lt;span class=&quot;ver&quot;&gt;5.2.0&lt;/span&gt;-Linux-$(uname -m).deb
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2&gt;background and motivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section readability=&quot;49&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;rr's original motivation was to make debugging of intermittent failures easier. These failures are hard to debug because any given program run may not show the failure. We wanted to create a tool that would record program executions with low overhead, so you can record test executions until you see a failure, and then replay the failing execution repeatedly under a debugger until it has been completely understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also hoped that deterministic replay would make debugging of any kind of bug easier. With normal debuggers, information you learn during the debugging session (e.g. the addresses of objects of interest, and the ordering of important events) often becomes obsolete when you have to rerun the testcase. With deterministic replay, that never needs to happen: your knowledge of what happens during the failing run increases monotonically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, since debugging is the process of tracing effects to their causes, it's much easier if your debugger can execute backwards in time. It's well-known that given a record/replay system which provides restartable checkpoints during replay, you can simulate reverse execution to a particular point in time by restoring the previous checkpoint and executing forwards to the desired point. So we hoped that if we built a low-overhead record-and-replay system that works well on the applications we care about (Firefox), we could build a really usable backend for gdb's reverse execution commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These goals have all been met.&lt;/strong&gt; rr is not only a working tool, but it's being used regularly by developers inside and outside Mozilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rr records a group of Linux user-space processes and captures all inputs to those processes from the kernel, plus any nondeterministic CPU effects performed by those processes (of which there are very few). rr replay guarantees that execution preserves instruction-level control flow and memory and register contents. The memory layout is always the same, the addresses of objects don't change, register values are identical, syscalls return the same data, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tools like fuzzers and randomized fault injectors become even more powerful when used with rr. Those tools are very good at triggering &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; intermittent failure, but it's often hard to reproduce &lt;em&gt;that same&lt;/em&gt; failure again to debug it. With rr, the randomized execution can simply be recorded. If the execution failed, then the saved recording can be used to deterministically debug the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rr lowers the cost of fixing bugs. rr helps produce higher-quality software for the same cost. rr also makes debugging more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2&gt;rr in context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Record-and-replay debugging is an old idea; many systems preceded rr. What makes rr different are the design goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Initial focus on Firefox&lt;/em&gt;. Many record and replay techniques require specific programming languages or don't scale well and thus can't handle Firefox --- or were just experimental and were never fleshed out. Firefox is a complex application, so given rr is useful for debugging Firefox, it is likely to be generally useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deployability&lt;/em&gt;. rr runs on stock Linux kernels, on commodity hardware, and requires no system configuration changes. Many record and replay techniques require kernel changes. Many rely on running the OS in a virtual machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Low run-time overload&lt;/em&gt;. We want rr to replace gdb in your workflow. That means you need to start getting results with rr about as quickly as you would if you were using gdb. Low overhead also means less perturbation of tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Simplicity of design&lt;/em&gt;. We didn't have a lot of resources to develop rr, so we avoided approaches that rely on complex techniques such as dynamic binary instrumentation. This simplicity has also made rr more robust and lower overhead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overhead of rr depends on your application's workload. On Firefox test suites, rr's recording performance is quite usable. We see slowdowns down to â¤ 1.2x. A 1.2x slowdown means that if the suite takes 10 minutes to run by itself, it will take around 12 minutes to be recorded by rr. However, overhead can vary dramatically depending on the workload. For mostly-single-threaded programs, rr has much lower overhead than any competing record-and-replay system we know of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2&gt;limitations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section&gt;&lt;p&gt;rr â¦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;emulates a single-core machine. So, parallel programs incur the slowdown of running on a single core. This is an inherent feature of the design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cannot record processes that share memory with processes outside the recording tree. This is an inherent feature of the design. rr automatically disables features such as X shared memory for recorded processes to avoid this problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;requires a reasonably modern x86 CPU. It depends on certain performance counter features that are not available in older CPUs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;requires knowledge of every system call executed by the recorded processes. It already supports a wide range of syscalls â those needed by Firefox and other applications people have tackled with rr â but support isn't complete, so running rr on your application may uncover a syscall that needs to be implemented. Please &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla/rr/issues/&quot;&gt;file github issues&lt;/a&gt; for unsupported system calls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sometimes needs to be updated in response to kernel changes, updates to system libraries, or new CPU families. If rr isn't working for you (and the above caveats do not apply), please &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla/rr/issues/&quot;&gt;file an issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

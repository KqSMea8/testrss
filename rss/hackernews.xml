&lt;p&gt;“Break the Internet” and get everyone’s attention by changing your “Relationship Status.” Get “Married” (to the free and open Internet). Share the status and then immediately add a comment sending people to take action at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com&quot;&gt;battleforthenet.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) Go to “About” section of your Facebook page and choose “Family and Relationships” in the left sidebar. Add a relationship status and choose &quot;Married&quot; and hit “Save Changes”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-07-11-how-to-stand-up-for-netneutrality-on-tumblr/&quot;&gt;these step-by-step instructions&lt;/a&gt; to add a &quot;Contact Congress&quot; widget to your Tumblr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;linkedin&quot; readability=&quot;23&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You can join with LinkedIn…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a “new job” position to your profile called “Defending Net Neutrality at BattleForTheNet.com”—this will trigger a notification to your network and get more people to take action before the vote. &lt;strong&gt;Here’s how:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Make sure your settings are set to: “notify people when your profile changes”. Go to the upper right hand corner, choose settings and go to the Privacy tab. Make sure you choose yes on “Sharing profile edits”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com/breaktheinternet/images/linkedin1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Go to your profile and choose the pen to edit. And, add a new position:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com/breaktheinternet/images/linkedin2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Here’s some text you can add:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The FCC is voting to end net neutrality on Dec. 14th. Congress can still stop the vote, but only if we make them. Go to https://www.battleforthenet.com to #StoptheFCC and defend net neutrality before it's too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, join me in &quot;breaking the Internet&quot; by adding a new job position to your LinkedIn profile too and tell your network how to #stopthefcc: http://breaktheinternetprotest.org”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com/breaktheinternet/images/linkedin3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;reddit&quot; readability=&quot;4.9834437086093&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You can join with Reddit…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s do another community takeover! Everyone post links to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com&quot;&gt;https://www.battleforthenet.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.breaktheinternetprotest.org&quot;&gt;https://www.breaktheinternetprotest.org&lt;/a&gt; -- get wild and creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a mod, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepOurNetFree/comments/7j3vy4/heres_a_theme_that_any_subreddit_can_use_to/&quot;&gt;check this thread&lt;/a&gt; with CSS you can use to change your theme and “break” your subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;widgets&quot; readability=&quot;-4.3259557344064&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You can join the protest with your site…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can display a prominent alert on your site that shows the world what the web will look like without net neutrality, and asks your visitors to call Congress. &lt;a href=&quot;https://widget.battleforthenet.com/demos/modal.html&quot;&gt;Click here for a demo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fightforthefuture/battleforthenet-widget&quot;&gt;grab the code on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-07-11-how-to-stand-up-for-netneutrality-on-tumblr/&quot;&gt;check out these instructions for Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;. None of these will actually block, slow, or paywall your site. But, they will let your users contact their representatives in Congress without having to leave your page. They appear once per user per day and users can easily click away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just add this line of code to your site's header:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;textarea readonly=&quot;readonly&quot; onclick=&quot;this.select()&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;var _bftn_options = { theme: 'glitch' };&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&amp;lt;script src=&quot;https://widget.battleforthenet.com/widget.js&quot; async&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/textarea&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or to go epic and be a hero to the Internet, you can completely turn your site red. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/FFTFCSSTEST/&quot;&gt;Here's an example from Reddit&lt;/a&gt; and you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/LuzFaltex/Site-Red-Out&quot;&gt;get the code on Github&lt;/a&gt;. (Visitors can still scroll down to get to your site, but c'mon, this is really epic.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/FFTFCSSTEST/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com/breaktheinternet/images/epic-reddit-screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 name=&quot;59f5&quot; id=&quot;59f5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3 graf--subtitle&quot;&gt;What we learned growing Winnie’s network of parents from a small private beta to a booming national community.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;152.32529444756&quot;&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3b6f&quot; id=&quot;3b6f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Acquiring your first 100k active users is an art, but a messy one—especially if you don’t have a lot of money to spend on marketing and paid acquisition. Winnie crossed this important milestone earlier this year, so I wanted to share some insights about how we did it, with a special focus on strategies that work for almost any product and cost no (or very little) money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;c4a5&quot; id=&quot;c4a5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What We Built&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fe24&quot; id=&quot;fe24&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Simply put, &lt;a href=&quot;https://winnie.com&quot; data-href=&quot;https://winnie.com&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Winnie&lt;/a&gt; is an app that helps parents find the information they need to be successful. This information can be local (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://winnie.com/childcare&quot; data-href=&quot;https://winnie.com/childcare&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nearby daycares with open spaces&lt;/a&gt;) or it can be topical (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://winnie.com/topics/breastfeeding&quot; data-href=&quot;https://winnie.com/topics/breastfeeding&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;help with breastfeeding&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3586&quot; id=&quot;3586&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Almost all of this information is crowdsourced, which makes Winnie a &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;network-effect product &lt;/strong&gt;— every user we acquire increases the value of the product to other users, primarily through the content they contribute but also through their engagement with other users. Products like this have certain natural advantages when it comes to growth, but they also have a tough uphill climb in the early days when they may suffer from empty room syndrome or lack the data that early adopters are seeking. So how do you get started when you have very few users and kickstart the flywheel that delivers long-term organic growth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;cf61&quot; id=&quot;cf61&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What Worked&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;5696&quot; id=&quot;5696&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Grow even before you launch&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bc2d&quot; id=&quot;bc2d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Pre-launch startups often run a private beta with friends &amp;amp; family. This is a great practice, but it’s important to make sure that you have some growth mechanism for that beta, whether through invitations or simply making the beta public. Think about it—your goal with a beta is to test the effectiveness of the product, but shouldn’t the ability of that product to grow be one of the most important things to test?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c5a3&quot; id=&quot;c5a3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Winnie’s private beta grew from 10 to over 400 people in 3 months, driven almost entirely by invitations and personal referrals. Not only was this core group of early adopters extremely helpful to us, they also gave us confidence that this was a product people wanted and would grow on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;7772&quot; id=&quot;7772&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Go big or go home&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;017d&quot; id=&quot;017d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;It was very tempting to keep Winnie hyperlocal and just focus on one or two markets to start, but that approach cuts you off from a huge number of acquisition channels where you can’t target by locale (most notably for us, the App Stores). It’s also problematic to limit growth when one of the product theses is that it gets better the more people use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cfc8&quot; id=&quot;cfc8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So while we were ramping up for our v1 launch, we made the tough call to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.winnie.com/go-big-or-go-home-2303f9cb834a&quot; data-href=&quot;https://blog.winnie.com/go-big-or-go-home-2303f9cb834a&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;launch Winnie everywhere&lt;/a&gt;, even in regions where we had almost no data. We gave these users a different onboarding flow, where we allowed them to unlock the product by contributing reviews. And it’s a good thing we did, because Apple featured Winnie on the front page of the App Store immediately after we launched. Without the Early Access flow, we would have been turning those users away at the door; instead, we used the opportunity to bootstrap valuable content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*f-Uv6J4Li4y3jwuTCJPK8w.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1000&quot; data-height=&quot;573&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*f-Uv6J4Li4y3jwuTCJPK8w.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*f-Uv6J4Li4y3jwuTCJPK8w.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The Early Access flow from Winnie’s v1 launch.
&lt;h4 name=&quot;faf8&quot; id=&quot;faf8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--h4-em&quot;&gt;Do&lt;/em&gt; run ads — but use them to test value propositions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;204b&quot; id=&quot;204b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;It’s very hard to grow if you don’t know how to position your product effectively. Luckily, we have the benefit of self-service advertising platforms — in particular Facebook and Google—to help you very efficiently test ideas and creative with different demographics. With even a very modest spend, you can try a ton of ideas and see what performs the best. This can also give you good data about what people are looking for; in one test we found that people responded especially well to “find places where kids eat free” so we invested in the content and it’s now one of our most popular features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;1ede&quot; id=&quot;1ede&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Do the work to get featured by Apple &amp;amp; Google&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*xbPDDYHMMisW_He5ql3hIw.png&quot; data-width=&quot;603&quot; data-height=&quot;734&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*xbPDDYHMMisW_He5ql3hIw.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*xbPDDYHMMisW_He5ql3hIw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e54c&quot; id=&quot;e54c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;App store featuring is the closest thing we’ve had to “act of God” growth — it can give you a huge influx of new users, but you have little control over when it happens. That said, Winnie has been featured several times in both stores, largely due to the fact that we’ve done the work to make ourselves eligible and attractive for featuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5c98&quot; id=&quot;5c98&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I could write a whole blog post about how to get the blessings of the app store gods, but here are the high level points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;299a&quot; id=&quot;299a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Ignore the siren song of “build once, deploy anywhere” and build &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;native&lt;/em&gt; apps that are responsive, stable, and showcase the power of the platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;69ed&quot; id=&quot;69ed&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Both Apple &amp;amp; Google have extremely detailed design and UI guidelines — respect them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;dfd5&quot; id=&quot;dfd5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Invest in a unique and beautiful app icon, as well as striking promotional art assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;5ad9&quot; id=&quot;5ad9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Incorporate platform integrations when you can, for example building in Apple Pay support when Apple is heavily promoting it on the store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 name=&quot;5ad6&quot; id=&quot;5ad6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Remember that sharing is also about communication&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*VL8YPcM2e6k4XsqoJ6BrHA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;700&quot; data-height=&quot;724&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*VL8YPcM2e6k4XsqoJ6BrHA.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*VL8YPcM2e6k4XsqoJ6BrHA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Framing sharing as a communication action increased social sharing 300%.
&lt;p name=&quot;47c8&quot; id=&quot;47c8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Providing affordance for sharing your content or product is certainly important, but it turns out the way you frame that action can make a big difference in adoption. Early on, we had a Share button on every post, but noticed that it wasn’t getting a lot of usage. Instead, our users were asking us for ways to save posts to revisit later—along with an easy way to share those bookmarks with their spouses and partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0ac4&quot; id=&quot;0ac4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It occured to us that some users may not see themselves as “sharers”, but nearly everyone uses a communication product of some kind to coordinate with friends and family. So we removed the Share button and replaced it with a Save button that then prompts you to share the post. This prompt is framed more around communication than around broadcasting the content, and it worked astonishingly well—social shares shot up over 300%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;6948&quot; id=&quot;6948&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Always start with demand&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;56f2&quot; id=&quot;56f2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;From the very beginning we imagined Winnie as a place where parents could not only connect with one another but with the businesses, service providers, educators and medical professionals that they rely upon to raise their children and care for their families. However, such a vision relies on the successful development of a two-sided ecosystem, an extremely daunting task for any startup with limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*cSBydPyPjPKBrKdMPuiigQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;400&quot; data-height=&quot;866&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*cSBydPyPjPKBrKdMPuiigQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Winnie’s (magical!) daycare &amp;amp; preschool search started as a data project and grew to be one of our best acquisition channels.
&lt;p name=&quot;16b9&quot; id=&quot;16b9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;We decided to approach this problem by starting with demand — the consumptive audience of parents looking for information — and creating the supply ourselves. Many of our early growth initiatives were actually data acquisition projects, such as creating fully-researched listings for over 5000 &lt;a href=&quot;https://winnie.com/childcare&quot; data-href=&quot;https://winnie.com/childcare&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;daycares and preschools&lt;/a&gt; in the Bay Area. This turned out to be a good move, as this valuable data brought on a loyal audience of parents that now organically attracts businesses to provide that content themselves. (For further reading be sure to check out Ben Thompson’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Aggregation Theory&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;f600&quot; id=&quot;f600&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Stop optimizing the product for the audience you already have&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6336&quot; id=&quot;6336&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;As a product designer, one of the things I have to be very disciplined about is not overly focusing on the current iteration of the product. At first, Winnie was a very useful app for parents of babies and toddlers, as it could help you find restaurants with high chairs and parks with changing tables. However, it had very little to offer parents of older children in those early days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d826&quot; id=&quot;d826&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We knew that in order for Winnie to work we needed it to be as big as possible, so instead of doubling down on making our app a great changing table finder, we opted instead to build features that unlock new cohorts of users. One example is &lt;a href=&quot;https://winnie.com/childcare&quot; data-href=&quot;https://winnie.com/childcare&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;daycare &amp;amp; preschool search&lt;/a&gt;, which brought on a slightly older group of parents with 3 to 5 year olds. Another is &lt;a href=&quot;https://winnie.com/topics&quot; data-href=&quot;https://winnie.com/topics&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;topic pages&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed us to build relevant content around special interests including &lt;a href=&quot;https://winnie.com/big-kids/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://winnie.com/big-kids/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;teens &amp;amp; pre-teens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://winnie.com/topics/blended-families&quot; data-href=&quot;https://winnie.com/topics/blended-families&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blended families&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://winnie.com/topics/single-parents&quot; data-href=&quot;https://winnie.com/topics/single-parents&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;single parents&lt;/a&gt; and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;7ca3&quot; id=&quot;7ca3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What Didn’t Work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;8dae&quot; id=&quot;8dae&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;In-person marketing events&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;427e&quot; id=&quot;427e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;While these are great for branding and can be a good way to cultivate a sense of community among your users, events are extremely time-consuming. Especially for a team of all engineers, the ROI was almost never worth it for us compared to larger-scale growth projects we could spend our time on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;07b2&quot; id=&quot;07b2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Being mobile-only&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;41b4&quot; id=&quot;41b4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;This was probably the biggest mistake we made early on. While we correctly sized up our target market (millennial parents) as heavy consumers of apps, when it comes to growth the web is still hugely important. These days the lion’s share of our organic growth comes from web traffic in the form of organic search, social shares and word of mouth. Mobile-first is great. Mobile-only is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;7c39&quot; id=&quot;7c39&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Relying on push notifications alone&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ac17&quot; id=&quot;ac17&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing&quot;&gt;Another common mobile-first error here. It’s tempting to think that if you have an app installed on someone’s phone, it will be easy to reactivate them because you can use push to bring them back into the app. However, just because push is an option doesn’t mean you should neglect more traditional channels like email. Email is still very important — don’t neglect it!&lt;/p&gt;

<description>Broadband services are a wonderful innovation of our time, using multiple frequency &lt;em&gt;bands&lt;/em&gt; (hence the name) to carry signals over wires (usually copper, sometimes aluminium). One of the key aspects of the technology is its ability to adapt to the length and characteristics of the &lt;em&gt;line&lt;/em&gt; on which it is deployed.&lt;p&gt;We have seen faults on broadband circuits that manifest as the system adapting to much lower speeds, this is a key factor as a service can work, but unusually slowly, over very bad lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has always been said that ADSL will work over a bit of wet string.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well one of our techies (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aa.net.uk/&quot;&gt;www.aa.net.uk&lt;/a&gt;) took it upon himself to try it today at the office, and well done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He got some proper string, and made it wet...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PI6GDS0UiK0/WjAXI5DF5PI/AAAAAAAAGbc/ieEBnmbx53EifjIVw8AlnqZZrjD28IRIACLcBGAs/s1600/DQziME8WsAAT8ZP.jpg-large.jpeg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1600&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PI6GDS0UiK0/WjAXI5DF5PI/AAAAAAAAGbc/ieEBnmbx53EifjIVw8AlnqZZrjD28IRIACLcBGAs/s400/DQziME8WsAAT8ZP.jpg-large.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;398&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It turns out he needed salty water to get anywhere.&lt;p&gt;A 2m length...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dA2R_S9SCn8/WjAhVtpvzSI/AAAAAAAAGb0/eOB91I2J8iQsQ62zvFR8MtRZjff-4EAJwCEwYBhgL/s1600/DQ3XL2hXcAAhodq.jpg-large.jpeg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1600&quot; data-original-width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dA2R_S9SCn8/WjAhVtpvzSI/AAAAAAAAGb0/eOB91I2J8iQsQ62zvFR8MtRZjff-4EAJwCEwYBhgL/s400/DQ3XL2hXcAAhodq.jpg-large.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;225&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-l3vf51_DNL0/WjAXPrvveiI/AAAAAAAAGbg/1aDNo7bFBCQwFCrxheMuWrXiI1AN1I8_gCLcBGAs/s1600/DQ3MsLnWsAAmJs7.jpg-large.jpeg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1600&quot; data-original-width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-l3vf51_DNL0/WjAXPrvveiI/AAAAAAAAGbg/1aDNo7bFBCQwFCrxheMuWrXiI1AN1I8_gCLcBGAs/s400/DQ3MsLnWsAAmJs7.jpg-large.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;225&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;And the result - it works!!! Not even that slow (3½Mb/s down) though slow uplink. Don't dare touch the string though...&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PsmeKKPx04E/WjAXT_iyjHI/AAAAAAAAGbk/v-GJUCQ9JPEyTxcMDqMNjzoPGyr4pWGRACLcBGAs/s1600/DQ3NL95XUAAabAq.jpg-large.jpeg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;900&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PsmeKKPx04E/WjAXT_iyjHI/AAAAAAAAGbk/v-GJUCQ9JPEyTxcMDqMNjzoPGyr4pWGRACLcBGAs/s400/DQ3NL95XUAAabAq.jpg-large.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;So, there you go, ADSL over 2m of literal &quot;wet string&quot;. Well done all for testing this. It shows the importance of handling faults that seem to just be &quot;low speed&quot;.&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, fit tin cans to both ends and you get voice as well as broadband on the same wet string!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Susan Fowler joined &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/topics/organisations/Uber&quot; data-trackable=&quot;link&quot;&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt; in late 2015, the company looked like an unstoppable juggernaut. It was expanding rapidly around the world and becoming the most valuable start-up of all time. For software engineers like Ms Fowler, there was exciting work to be done on the app that was changing transportation. Employees at San Francisco’s hottest company proudly wore their Uber sweatshirts around town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But two years later, those sweatshirts are no longer visible and Uber is in crisis. Beset by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/d890585e-d102-11e7-9dbb-291a884dd8c6&quot; data-trackable=&quot;link&quot;&gt;one setback after another&lt;/a&gt;, the company has become a symbol of everything that is wrong with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/c9a8b592-a81d-11e7-ab55-27219df83c97&quot; data-trackable=&quot;link&quot;&gt;hard-driving tech world&lt;/a&gt;. In large part, that shift is due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/469fbaec-fa76-11e6-9516-2d969e0d3b65&quot; data-trackable=&quot;link&quot;&gt;Ms Fowler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February she published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber&quot; data-trackable=&quot;link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; about her time at Uber that lifted the lid on a company that was out of control. Ms Fowler described the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/stream/fc9213c8-174d-318e-922f-e5e103dc9fc4&quot; data-trackable=&quot;link&quot;&gt;sexual harassment&lt;/a&gt; she experienced, including her boss propositioning her for sex on the first day she joined his team. The human resources department turned a blind eye to her complaints, saying he was a “high performer”. When she wrote about this and other incidents, her post quickly went viral. Ms Fowler had pulled on a thread that would lead to a great unravelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the process, the 26-year-old from rural Arizona who had to teach herself at the local library to get into university, found herself at the centre of three of the most important trends of the year. Her description of the reality of working at Uber generated a crisis that has raised questions about the very viability of the company. They also formed an early part of the growing backlash against the power and influence of the Big Tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of all, her intervention was one of the most important testimonies in what — as the year comes to a close — has become an avalanche of allegations about sexual harassment and assault that have brought down some of the most important men in media, entertainment and business, and which hold the potential to improve the way women are treated at work permanently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Women have been speaking up for many, many years, but were very rarely believed, and there were almost never any real consequences for offenders,” Ms Fowler told the Financial Times. “This year, that completely changed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;n-image-wrapper n-image-wrapper--placeholder&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot; class=&quot;n-image&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.prod-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fce7a8f2c-de83-11e7-8f9f-de1c2175f5ce?source=next&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;width=700 700w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.prod-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fce7a8f2c-de83-11e7-8f9f-de1c2175f5ce?source=next&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;width=500 500w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.prod-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fce7a8f2c-de83-11e7-8f9f-de1c2175f5ce?source=next&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;width=300 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 76.25em) 700px, (min-width: 61.25em) 620px, (min-width: 46.25em) 700px, calc(100vw - 20px)&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside Uber, her story immediately struck a nerve. The account was so damning because it detailed the complicity of Uber’s HR department and top executives who protected the harasser. A few days after the post came out, employees wept at the company-wide meeting that was held to discuss it. Uber’s board launched several investigations and adopted far-reaching corporate governance reforms. The company set up a hotline for harassment complaints, drawing tips that resulted in more than 20 employees being fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of Uber, the reaction was just as dramatic. Investors started to question whether &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/9b65a59a-03e1-11e7-ace0-1ce02ef0def9&quot; data-trackable=&quot;link&quot;&gt;Travis Kalanick&lt;/a&gt;, the controversial chief executive (who used to refer to the company as “Boob-er” because it helped him meet women) had created a company whose culture had become poisonous. Low morale inside Uber contributed to a series of damaging leaks, including revelations about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40196055&quot; data-trackable=&quot;link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mishandling of a rape victim’s medical records&lt;/a&gt; and the existence of Greyball, a technology used to mislead regulators. Mr Kalanick vowed to change, but by June investors demanded that he step down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Susan Fowler’s letter was the tipping point for us,” says one Uber investor, Freada Kapor Klein, a partner at Kapor Capital. “We had been trying to get the company to address this behind the scenes. But with Susan’s blog post, it was — that is enough, it has so crossed the line, it is time for drastic action.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uber could not have&lt;/strong&gt; found a more unlikely nemesis than the petite Ms Fowler. She grew up in what she describes as poverty as one of seven children in a small rural Arizona town with just 600 people. Her father was a preacher, prison chaplain and at one stage a high school teacher. Ms Fowler never graduated from high school, instead working as a babysitter and ranch hand, and teaching herself in the local library. Lacking a formal education but determined to go to university, she submitted a list of books she had read as part of her college application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After winning a place at Arizona State University to study philosophy, she then transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, earning a degree in physics. In her final year at Penn, she wrote a blog entitled “If Susan can learn physics, so can you”, explaining how she caught up despite having no secondary maths education. By the time she reached Uber at age 24, she was a physicist and computer scientist, and wrote her first book about software architecture while working at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;n-image-wrapper n-image-wrapper--placeholder&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot; class=&quot;n-image&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.prod-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7629322c-de76-11e7-8f9f-de1c2175f5ce?source=next&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;width=700 700w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.prod-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7629322c-de76-11e7-8f9f-de1c2175f5ce?source=next&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;width=500 500w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.prod-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7629322c-de76-11e7-8f9f-de1c2175f5ce?source=next&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;width=300 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 76.25em) 700px, (min-width: 61.25em) 620px, (min-width: 46.25em) 700px, calc(100vw - 20px)&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since leaving Uber last December, Ms Fowler, who now works at the payments start-up Stripe, has kept a low profile. She says she did not imagine the post would have such a big impact. “I expected the reaction to die down, but it never did,” she says. “It became much bigger than me, so much bigger than Uber.” Ms Fowler is currently eight months pregnant and on bed rest and, due to health concerns agreed to a written, rather than a face-to face interview, for this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms Fowler says she felt compelled to blow the whistle because “it was the right thing to do”. The fact her background is so different from her peers in Silicon Valley may have also played a role, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I was younger, I used to think that my unconventional upbringing was a weakness, but over the past few years I’ve learnt to see it as one of my greatest strengths,” she says. “I never had a single thing handed to me, I had to fight for everything I wanted, like my education. When I was harassed and discriminated against, I fought as hard as I could — because I hadn’t gone through all of that, I hadn’t worked so hard my entire life, just to have someone take it away from me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time Ms Fowler published her blog post, the Uber sexual harassment scandal might have seemed like an isolated incident. But the ripples travelled well beyond one company. This year has seen an unprecedented number of women speak publicly about sexual harassment — and unprecedented consequences for their harassers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Silicon Valley, female entrepreneurs recalled how pitch meetings with potential investors could lead to unwanted groping or propositions. The wave of allegations prompted the firing and resignation of several prominent venture capitalists — including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/ed46db44-9767-11e7-a652-cde3f882dd7b&quot; data-trackable=&quot;link&quot;&gt;chief executive of SoFi&lt;/a&gt;, the online lender, and Justin Caldbeck, a co-founder of Binary Capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months later the tidal wave reached Hollywood. The New York Times and New Yorker revealed in October that Hollywood mogul &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/1dc8a8ae-b7e0-11e7-8c12-5661783e5589&quot; data-trackable=&quot;link&quot;&gt;Harvey Weinstein had a pattern of sexual harassment and assault&lt;/a&gt; that went back decades. Mr Weinstein was fired from his eponymous company and is under investigation by police in at least two countries. Among the dozens of actresses making accusations were Gwyneth Paltrow and Rose McGowan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the #MeToo campaign swept across social media, as millions of women and some men shared personal stories of sexual harassment, assault and abuse. The movement has only continued &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/204ab48c-d54f-11e7-a303-9060cb1e5f44&quot; data-trackable=&quot;link&quot;&gt;to spread&lt;/a&gt;. In November, American television stars including Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer were forced to resign due to revelations about harassing colleagues. In politics, Al Franken in the Senate and John Conyers and Trent Frank in the House of Representatives have announced plans to retire after facing harassment allegations. Congress introduced a bill last month that would change the way congressional employees can report harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a kind of unmasking going on. A lot of these are people who are venerated, people who were taken very seriously,” says Robin Lakoff, a professor of linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley. In the past, a sex scandal might be in the headlines for a few weeks and then disappear. “This one seems to really have legs, because new ones keep cropping up,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are many reasons&lt;/strong&gt; this is happening now but most explanations point, at least in part, to the presence in the White House of President Donald Trump, who was caught on record boasting about sexually assaulting women. In a 2005 recording that was released shortly before last year’s election, Mr Trump says: “When you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything . . . Grab ’em by the pussy. You can do anything.” Since then, at least 16 women have come forward to accuse Mr Trump of sexual harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact he was elected to the highest office despite those remarks has fuelled a backlash. The day after his inauguration, millions of women across hundreds of cities took to the streets to demonstrate in the Women’s March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media has also played a part. Ms Fowler, who is constantly on Twitter, says social media had a “very positive role” in the movement. “It has given a voice to many, like myself, who otherwise wouldn’t have had a platform,” she says. “#MeToo is a perfect example of this . . . It made the rest of the world finally understand the true extent of inappropriate behaviour against women, and the damage it causes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason why 2017 has been a turning point is simply that there is strength in numbers: women have been inspired by others who spoke out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Definitely she was a role model for me,” says Cheryl Yeoh, an entrepreneur who published her own account of assault in July. Like Ms Fowler, Ms Yeoh decided to write her story herself and publish it online, rather than approach a journalist or try to go through a lawyer. She says that watching the impact Ms Fowler had on Uber was very encouraging. “If I hadn’t seen what had happened to Uber after her post, I wouldn’t have dared to write my account,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cultural shift that has come about this year is also the result of decades of work by activists and leaders fighting for equal rights. Ms Klein links the wave of allegations back to events like the 1991 testimony of Anita Hill, whose televised account of sexual harassment by Clarence Thomas riveted the country during his confirmation hearing for the Supreme Court, and to the founding of the “Me Too” movement a decade ago by activist Tarana Burke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What Susan Fowler and the #MeToo movement have in common is they both stand on the shoulders of giants,” says Ms Klein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier generations of female leaders often found sexual harassment a complex issue to raise, and instead focused on areas like equal pay or reproductive rights. Women who spoke out about harassment often found themselves blamed, and their careers derailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilly Ledbetter, the equal pay advocate whose court case on wage discrimination made it to the Supreme Court and resulted in the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act in 2009, welcomes the #MeToo movement. “I wish this had happened earlier,” she says. “I’ve been so glad that this is all coming to the forefront now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She recalls her own experience of harassment in the early 1980s — when a manager asked that she have sex with him in order to get a high performance review. She never reported it at that time. “I let that one slide,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Things have gotten more open and people have a tendency to support each other better today,” she says. “I think women in the beginning didn’t trust each other and didn’t support each other, and now they are better at that. There are companies that are looking at their policies and changing, and being a lot more supportive,” she says. One policy change that would make a difference is ending the widespread practice of making employees seek arbitration for harassment claims, and Congress is currently considering a bill that would end that practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, some are concerned the movement could end up backfiring in subtle ways, or result in discrimination against women in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The percentage of men who will be afraid to be alone with a female colleague has to be sky high right now,” wrote Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer at Facebook, in a recent post. “I have already heard the rumblings of a backlash: ‘This is why you shouldn’t hire women.’ Actually, this is why you should,” she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms Fowler is expected to give birth to a little girl. At Stripe, she is the editor-in-chief of a quarterly magazine called &lt;a href=&quot;https://increment.com/&quot; data-trackable=&quot;link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Increment&lt;/a&gt;, which is geared towards software engineers. She is also working on a book and a movie about her experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;n-content-recommended&quot; role=&quot;complementary&quot; data-editorial-component-id=&quot;component1&quot; data-trackable=&quot;recommended&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;n-content-recommended__title&quot;&gt;Recommended&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fortunes of Uber, on the other hand, have changed more drastically than anyone could have imagined. The company that once looked invincible has seen its valuation fall from $71bn to $54bn and it has lost market share in the US. “Would Uber have changed if it weren’t for Susan’s blog post? I don’t know,” one senior executive admits privately. “Certainly her post gave us the resolve that we needed to change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contrast between the plaudits for Ms Fowler and the crisis at Uber is perhaps the clearest sign of how much things have changed for women who speak up about harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet it still comes at a cost. “The most difficult [thing] has been that being a whistleblower displaces and dwarfs all of your other career aspirations, all your accomplishments. You’re no longer the engineer, or the physicist, or the writer — you’re the whistleblower,” says Ms Fowler. Nevertheless, she says, it is “a badge of honour”.&lt;/p&gt;

The protocols themselves looked about the same ‘on the wire’ for a very long time (excepting IPv6, which already gets its fair amount of attention in the network operator community.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, network operators, vendors, and policymakers that want to understand (and sometimes, control) the Internet have adopted a number of practices based upon these protocols’ wire ‘footprint’ — whether intended to debug issues, improve quality of service, or impose policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, significant changes to the core Internet protocols are underway. While they are intended to be compatible with the Internet at large (since they won’t get adoption otherwise), they might be disruptive to those who have taken liberties with undocumented aspects of protocols or made an assumption that things won’t change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why we need to change the Internet&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of factors driving these changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the limits of the core Internet protocols have become apparent, especially regarding performance. Because of structural problems in the application and transport protocols, the network was not being used as efficiently as it could be, leading to end-user perceived performance (in particular, latency).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This translates into a strong motivation to evolve or replace those protocols because there is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/09/why-performance-matters-the-perception-of-time/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;large body of experience showing the impact of even small performance gains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the ability to evolve Internet protocols — at any layer — has become more difficult over time, largely thanks to the unintended uses by networks discussed above. For example, HTTP proxies that tried to compress responses made it more difficult to deploy new compression techniques; TCP optimization in middleboxes made it more difficult to deploy improvements to TCP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/46197.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;we are in the midst of a shift towards more use of encryption on the Internet&lt;/a&gt;, first spurred by Edward Snowden’s revelations in 2015. That’s really a separate discussion, but it is relevant here in that encryption is one of best tools we have to ensure that protocols can evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s have a look at what’s happened, what’s coming next, how it might impact networks, and how networks impact protocol design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;HTTP/2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://http2.github.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;HTTP/2&lt;/a&gt; (based on Google’s SPDY) was the first notable change — standardized in 2015, it multiplexes multiple requests onto one TCP connection, thereby avoiding the need to queue requests on the client without blocking each other. It is now widely deployed, and supported by all major browsers and web servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a network’s viewpoint, HTTP/2 made a few notable changes. First, it’s a binary protocol, so any device that assumes it’s HTTP/1.1 is going to break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That breakage was one of the primary reasons for another big change in HTTP/2; it effectively requires encryption. This gives it a better chance of avoiding interference from intermediaries that assume it’s HTTP/1.1, or do more subtle things like strip headers or block new protocol extensions — both things that had been seen by some of the engineers working on the protocol, causing significant support problems for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7540.html#TLSUsage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;HTTP/2 also requires TLS/1.2 to be used when it is encrypted&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7540.html#BadCipherSuites&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;blacklists&lt;/a&gt; cipher suites that were judged to be insecure — with the effect of only allowing ephemeral keys. See the TLS 1.3 section for potential impacts here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, HTTP/2 allows more than one host’s requests to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7540.html#reuse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;coalesced onto a connection&lt;/a&gt;, to improve performance by reducing the number of connections (and thereby, congestion control contexts) used for a page load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, you could have a connection for &lt;tt&gt;www.example.com&lt;/tt&gt;, but also use it for requests for &lt;tt&gt;images.example.com&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bishop-httpbis-http2-additional-certs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Future protocol extensions might also allow additional hosts to be added to the connection&lt;/a&gt;, even if they weren’t listed in the original TLS certificate used for it. As a result, assuming that the traffic on a connection is limited to the purpose it was initiated for isn’t going to apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these changes, it’s worth noting that HTTP/2 doesn’t appear to suffer from significant interoperability problems or interference from networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;TLS 1.3&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-tls13/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;TLS 1.3&lt;/a&gt; is just going through the final processes of standardization and is already supported by some implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t be fooled by its incremental name; this is effectively a new version of TLS, with a much-revamped handshake that allows application data to flow from the start (often called ‘0RTT’). The new design relies upon ephemeral key exchange, thereby ruling out static keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has caused concern from some network operators and vendors — in particular those who need visibility into what’s happening inside those connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, consider the datacentre for a bank that has regulatory requirements for visibility. By sniffing traffic in the network and decrypting it with the static keys of their servers, they can log legitimate traffic and identify harmful traffic, whether it be attackers from the outside or employees trying to leak data from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TLS 1.3 doesn’t support that particular technique for intercepting traffic, since it’s also &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a form of attack that ephemeral keys protect against&lt;/a&gt;. However, since they have regulatory requirements to both use modern encryption protocols and to monitor their networks, this puts those network operators in an awkward spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s been much debate about whether regulations require static keys, whether alternative approaches could be just as effective, and whether weakening security for the entire Internet for the benefit of relatively few networks is the right solution. Indeed, it’s still possible to decrypt traffic in TLS 1.3, but you need access to the ephemeral keys to do so, and by design, they aren’t long-lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point it doesn’t look like TLS 1.3 will change to accommodate these networks, but there are rumblings about creating another protocol that allows a third party to observe what’s going on— and perhaps more — for these use cases. Whether that gets traction remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;QUIC&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During work on HTTP/2, it became evident that TCP has similar inefficiencies. Because TCP is an in-order delivery protocol, the loss of one packet can prevent those in the buffers behind it from being delivered to the application. For a multiplexed protocol, this can make a big difference in performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quicwg.github.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;QUIC&lt;/a&gt; is an attempt to address that by effectively rebuilding TCP semantics (along with some of HTTP/2’s stream model) on top of UDP. Like HTTP/2, it started as a Google effort and is now in the IETF, with an initial use case of HTTP-over-UDP and a goal of becoming a standard in late 2018. However, since Google has already deployed QUIC in the Chrome browser and on its sites, it already accounts for more than 7% of Internet traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.apnic.net/2016/08/30/questions-answered-quic/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your questions answered about QUIC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the shift from TCP to UDP for such a sizable amount of traffic (and all of the adjustments in networks that might imply), both Google QUIC (gQUIC) and IETF QUIC (iQUIC) require encryption to operate at all; there is no unencrypted QUIC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iQUIC uses TLS 1.3 to establish keys for a session and then uses them to encrypt each packet. However, since it’s UDP-based, a lot of the session information and metadata that’s exposed in TCP gets encrypted in QUIC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, iQUIC’s current &lt;a href=&quot;https://quicwg.github.io/base-drafts/draft-ietf-quic-transport.html#short-header&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;‘short header’&lt;/a&gt; — used for all packets except the handshake — only exposes a packet number, an optional connection identifier, and a byte of state for things like the encryption key rotation schedule and the packet type (which might end up encrypted as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything else is encrypted — including ACKs, to raise the bar for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mjkranch.com/docs/CODASPY17_Kranch_Reed_IdentifyingHTTPSNetflix.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;traffic analysis&lt;/a&gt; attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this means that passively estimating RTT and packet loss by observing connections is no longer possible; there isn’t enough information. This lack of observability has caused a significant amount of concern by some in the operator community, who say that passive measurements like this are critical for debugging and understanding their networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One proposal to meet this need is the ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-trammell-quic-spin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Spin Bit&lt;/a&gt;‘ — a bit in the header that flips once a round trip, so that observers can estimate RTT. Since it’s decoupled from the application’s state, it doesn’t appear to leak any information about the endpoints, beyond a rough estimate of location on the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;DOH&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newest change on the horizon is DOH — &lt;a href=&quot;https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/doh/about/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;DNS over HTTP&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/99/materials/slides-99-maprg-fingerprint-based-detection-of-dns-hijacks-using-ripe-atlas/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;significant amount of research has shown that networks commonly use DNS as a means of imposing policy&lt;/a&gt; (whether on behalf of the network operator or a greater authority).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circumventing this kind of control with encryption has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/dprive/about/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;discussed for a while&lt;/a&gt;, but it has a disadvantage (at least from some standpoints) — it is possible to discriminate it from other traffic; for example, by using its port number to block access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH addresses that by piggybacking DNS traffic onto an existing HTTP connection, thereby removing any discriminators. A network that wishes to block access to that DNS resolver can only do so by blocking access to the website as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if Google was to deploy its &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;public DNS service over DOH&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;tt&gt;www.google.com&lt;/tt&gt; and a user configures their browser to use it, a network that wants (or is required) to stop it would have to effectively block all of Google (thanks to how they host their services).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH has just started its work, but there’s already a fair amount of interest in it, and some rumblings of deployment. How the networks (and governments) that use DNS to impose policy will react remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.apnic.net/2017/11/17/ietf-100-singapore-dns-http-doh/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IETF 100, Singapore: DNS over HTTP (DOH!)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Ossification and grease&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To return to motivations, one theme throughout this work is how protocol designers are increasingly encountering problems where networks make assumptions about traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, TLS 1.3 has had a number of last-minute issues with middleboxes that assume it’s an older version of the protocol. gQUIC blacklists several networks that throttle UDP traffic, because they think that it’s harmful or low-priority traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a protocol can’t evolve because deployments ‘freeze’ its extensibility points, we say it has &lt;em&gt;ossified&lt;/em&gt;. TCP itself is a severe example of ossification; so many middleboxes do so many things to TCP — whether it’s blocking packets with TCP options that aren’t recognized, or ‘optimizing’ congestion control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s necessary to prevent ossification, to ensure that protocols can evolve to meet the needs of the Internet in the future; otherwise, it would be a ‘tragedy of the commons’ where the actions of some individual networks — although well-intended — would affect the health of the Internet overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to prevent ossification; if the data in question is encrypted, it cannot be accessed by any party but those that hold the keys, preventing interference. If an extension point is unencrypted but commonly used in a way that would break applications visibly (for example, HTTP headers), it’s less likely to be interfered with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where protocol designers can’t use encryption and an extension point isn’t used often, artificially exercising the extension point can help; we call this &lt;em&gt;greasing&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, QUIC encourages endpoints to use a range of decoy values in its &lt;a href=&quot;https://quicwg.github.io/base-drafts/draft-ietf-quic-transport.html#rfc.section.3.7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;version negotiation&lt;/a&gt;, to avoid implementations assuming that it will never change (as was often encountered in TLS implementations, leading to significant problems).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The network and the user&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the desire to avoid ossification, these changes also reflect the evolving relationship between networks and their users. While for a long time people assumed that networks were always benevolent — or at least disinterested — parties, this is no longer the case, thanks not only to &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7258&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;pervasive monitoring&lt;/a&gt; but also attacks like &lt;a href=&quot;http://codebutler.com/firesheep&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Firesheep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, there is growing tension between the needs of Internet users overall and those of the networks who want to have access to some amount of the data flowing over them. Particularly affected will be networks that want to impose policy upon those users; for example, enterprise networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, they might be able to meet their goals by installing software (or a CA certificate, or a browser extension) on their users’ machines. However, this isn’t as easy in cases where the network doesn’t own or have access to the computer; for example, BYOD has become common, and IoT devices seldom have the appropriate control interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, a lot of discussion surrounding protocol development in the IETF is touching on the sometimes competing needs of enterprises and other ‘leaf’ networks and the good of the Internet overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Get involved&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Internet to work well in the long run, it needs to provide value to end users, avoid ossification, and allow networks to operate. The changes taking place now need to meet all three goals, but we need more input from network operators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these changes affect your network — or won’t— please leave comments below, or better yet, get involved in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ietf.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;IETF&lt;/a&gt; by attending a meeting, joining a mailing list, or providing feedback on a draft.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>SEC Shuts Down Munchee ICO</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/12/sec-shuts-down-munchee-ico/</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/bg-foodee.jpg?w=738&quot; class=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;In what should be an interesting beginning to the coming avalanche of ICO failures, the SEC has come down hard on &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://munchee.io&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Munchee&lt;/a&gt;, a company that built a $15 million token sale. The &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/11/with-markets-going-crypto-crazy-sec-chairman-weighs-in/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;SEC chairman&lt;/a&gt; recently noted that coin offerings are, in fact, securities and that pre-sale participants must be registered with the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/sec-halts-multimillion-dollar-munchee-ico-securities-violations/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Munchee ICO&lt;/a&gt; aimed to fund the MUN coin, a payment system for restaurant reviews. The company received a &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2017/33-10445.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;cease and desist&lt;/a&gt; from the SEC on December 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the SECs findings they noted that Munchee touted itself as a “utility” token which means that the company believed the MUN token would be primarily used within the Munchee ecosystem and not be used to fund operations. However, thanks to an application of the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://consumer.findlaw.com/securities-law/what-is-the-howey-test.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Howey Test&lt;/a&gt; (a Supreme Court finding that essentially states that any instrument with the expectation of return is an investment vehicle), the SEC found the Munchee was actually releasing a security masquerading as a utility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Munchee offered MUN tokens in order to raise capital to build a profitable enterprise,” read the SEC notice. “Munchee said that it would use the offering proceeds to run its business, including hiring people to develop its product, promoting the Munchee App, and ensuring ‘the smooth operation of the MUN token ecosystem.'”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stickiest part? Munchee claimed that its coins would increase in value thanks to a convoluted process of growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the MUN White Paper, on the Munchee Website and elsewhere, Munchee and its agents further emphasized that the company would run its business in ways that would cause MUN tokens to rise in value. First, Munchee described a ‘tier’ plan in which the amount it would pay for a Munchee App review would depend on the amount of the author’s holdings of MUN tokens. For example, a “Diamond Level” holder having at least 300 MUN tokens would be paid more for a review than a “Gold Level” holder having only 200 MUN tokens. Also, Munchee said it could or would “burn” MUN tokens in the future when restaurants pay for advertising with MUN tokens, thereby taking MUN tokens out of circulation,” wrote the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final nail?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Munchee published a blog post on October 30, 2017 that was titled “7 Reasons You Need To Join The Munchee Token Generation Event.” Reason 4 listed on the post was “As more users get on the platform, the more valuable your MUN tokens will become” and then went on to describe how MUN purchasers could “watch[] their value increase over time” and could count on the “burning” of MUN tokens to raise the value of remaining MUN tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, Munchee was undone by two things: depending on the token sale as a vehicle to raise cash for operations and using the typically spammy and scammy marketing efforts most ICO floggers use now, tactics taken directly from affiliate marketing handbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until token sales leave the internet ghetto and refuse to use get-rich-quick tactics and erection pill marketing ploys, more and more of these ridiculous token sales will end in failure. Fortunately, Munchee was able to return all $15 million to the 40 investors that dumped their coins into scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to contact Munchee via their website but, like their ICO, that feature is shut down.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why Is Anime Obsessed With Power Lines?</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/why-power-lines-anime-electrical-infrastructure</guid>
<description>&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/49639/image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Some damn fine power lines from hit anime &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;One Punch Man&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;. &quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-49639&quot;/&gt;Some damn fine power lines from hit anime &lt;em&gt;One Punch Man&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.madhouse.co.jp/&quot;&gt;Madhouse/Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;section-start-text&quot;&gt;Tumblr can be a wild&lt;/span&gt; and … fascinating place. If you can think of it, there is a probably a Tumblr blog dedicated to it. From &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://law-order-food.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;Law &amp;amp; Order &amp;amp; Food&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to the classic &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://awkwardstockphotos.com/&quot;&gt;Awkward Stock Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://weirdtumblrs.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;a Tumblr dedicated to other weird Tumblrs&lt;/a&gt;, there is something for everyone. But every so often, amid all the hyper-specific strangeness and absurdity, something emerges that shines a light on some previously unexplored facet of the world. We know what you’re thinking: Why are there so many shots of power lines in Japanese anime cartoons?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;The Tumblr &lt;a href=&quot;https://powerlinesinanime.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power Lines in Anime&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is dedicated to appreciating the truly lovely and surprisingly ubiquitous depictions of mundane power lines that appear in a large number of Japanese animation series. The blog is run by Tumblr user whitequark, who first started to notice the trend while watching a romantic comedy anime. “I first noticed that power lines were ‘A Thing’ while watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crunchyroll.com/monthly-girls-nozaki-kun&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and looking at the background behind the reflection in the glass,” says whitequark, who prefers to use their online handle. “That made me think it over. Why, indeed, are there so many power lines? Why are these industrial constructs with lots of time-consuming detail drawn so consistently true to their nature?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/49651/image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A detailed shot of power lines from &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Neon Genesis Evangelion&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;.&quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-49651&quot;/&gt;A detailed shot of power lines from &lt;em&gt;Neon Genesis Evangelion&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=35&amp;amp;v=vGzJOeyJgFM&quot;&gt;Alexspier/YouTube&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Anime series can cover any number of genres, including sports, high fantasy, office life, and, of course, science fiction, but no matter what it’s about, it seems that if the story is set on modern-day Earth, it will contain some amazingly detailed images of power lines, telephone poles, and other wired infrastructure. While a number of anime series (and cartoons in general), opt for a style of hyper-detailed backgrounds before which relatively simpler characters can interact, power lines stand out for the detail and complexity required to illustrate them. Speaking about one such power line shot, whitquark says, “It serves no purpose to the story. It is not repeated, emphasized, seems to have no useful purpose. Yet it is there! Someone cared about it, cared about it so much to go outside, take a photo, lovingly trace and color it to utter perfection.” They might be mundane, but their consistent presence could point to a deeper significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vGzJOeyJgFM?start=35&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;“It puts the power infrastructure first and foremost as narrative and visual elements of the anime,” says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.concordia.ca/finearts/cinema/faculty.html?fpid=marc-steinberg&quot;&gt;Marc Steinberg&lt;/a&gt;, a scholar of film studies at Concordia University in Montreal and author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/animeas-media-mix&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anime’s Media Mix&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For years, he has been studying and teaching anime, and he has also noticed the prevalence of power lines. He traces the origin of the trend to one of the most popular anime series in recent memory. “I think it’s basically a post–&lt;a href=&quot;http://evangelion.wikia.com/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion_(anime)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neon Genesis Evangelion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; phenomenon,” he says. “One of the peculiarities [of the series], besides the crazy storyline, is that it really focused on objects in everyday life in a way that anime before that had not, as much. This includes shots of telephone booths, shots of doorways, train crossings. Things that were associated with everyday life in Japan at that moment in time.” In that anime specifically, Steinberg says, power lines are specifically highlighted as a visual connection to the theme of power that runs through the series—most fantastically and prominently seen in the colossal power cords connected to the titular giant robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;The trend didn’t stop with the series, but instead became a kind of signifier. “[&lt;em&gt;Evangelion&lt;/em&gt;] had all these shots of power lines, and it became this signature for the more experimental, slightly more adult-oriented anime that became popular in the late 1990s, early 2000s,” says Steinberg. He also mentions another influential anime that may have helped cement anime power lines as a recurring trope, &lt;em&gt;Serial Experiment Lain&lt;/em&gt;, released in 1998. The series, set in suburban Japan, focused heavily on themes of communication and electricity, and unsurprisingly had a number of illustrated power lines and telephone poles. whitequark says that they consider it “*the* power lines anime” (although their favorite anime power lines belong to &lt;a href=&quot;https://powerlinesinanime.tumblr.com/post/148972975619/nisemonogatari&quot;&gt;a series called &lt;em&gt;Monogatari&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OoGChbQ3h5E&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Maybe the most obvious explanation for the trend of power line shots is that many anime stories take place in and around some version of Tokyo, which contains a great number of power lines and electrical pylons IRL. “You’re kind of covered in power lines. A lot of the power grid is above ground. In places where the power grid is mostly underground, it’s not as evident and visible an aspect of everyday city life. In part because of the trains that run on electricity,” says Steinberg. Power lines act as a signal of the mundane and the normal in the modern Japanese landscape. They aren’t the only image that appears regularly in anime to signal everyday life, they stand out as both one of the most common and the most visually complex. “Train crossings are one of the other big ones,” says Steinberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf item-body-last&quot;&gt;Over the last two decades, the power line trope can now be found in all kinds of anime, including smash hits such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://onepunchman.wikia.com/wiki/One-Punch_Man_Wiki&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;One Punch Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The presence of detailed background infrastructure in a cartoon might seem like a small thing, but once you notice them, these seemingly innocuous images take on a whole new significance. whitequark certainly won’t see anime the same way again. “This, to me, seems like a reflection of anime’s soul in general: Spend all of yourself on the things almost no one will notice, and spend yourself thrice on things that truly are important.”&lt;/p&gt;

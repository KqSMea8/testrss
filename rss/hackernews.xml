&lt;p&gt;Tim Ferriss recently left Silicon Valley, citing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7erct8/i_am_tim_ferriss_host_of_the_tim_ferriss_show_and/dq6zrh1/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;liberal McCarthyism&lt;/a&gt; as one of the catalysts for his departure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Seen this quote surface a bunch in the last 24hrs in similar befuddlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminded me of this post by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jesslivingston?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@jesslivingston&lt;/a&gt; from nearly a year ago with a similar theme &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/3MIVjMopfW&quot;&gt;https://t.co/3MIVjMopfW&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/15vofrD88A&quot;&gt;https://t.co/15vofrD88A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People seem awfully puzzled that there are things you can’t say in Silicon Valley. I can’t tell if these people are willfully ignorant, or if their heads are jammed so far up their asses that they can’t conjure a single controversial idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I’ll help you guys out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stuff You Can’t Say&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s okay to support Trump.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;We agree that people shouldn’t be fired for their political views, but this isn’t a disagreement on tax policy, this is advocating hatred and violence.&lt;/em&gt; —&lt;a href=&quot;https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/technology/how-silicon-valley-treats-a-trump-backer-peter-thiel.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ellen Pao&lt;/a&gt;, after her company severed ties with Y Combinator for refusing to fire Peter Thiel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diversity of thought is more important than diversity of skin color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple diversity head Denise Young Smith apologizes for controversial choice of words —&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/13/apple-diversity-head-denise-young-smith-apologizes-for-controversial-choice-of-words-at-summit/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Techcrunch&lt;/a&gt;, Oct 13 2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silicon Valley uses H-1B visas to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-h-1b_us_5890d86ce4b0522c7d3d84af&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lower wages&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stltoday.com/opinion/columnists/silicon-valley-is-using-h--b-visas-to-crowd/article_2c3ac63c-360a-5c79-88b2-729d8673aa28.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;crowd out American minorities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If San Francisco residents really believed that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/04/30/oceans-rising-faster-than-scientific-forecasts/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sea levels were rising&lt;/a&gt;, they’d have all sold their homes by now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and these differences may explain why we don’t see equal representation of women in tech…”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Fires Author of Divisive Memo on Gender Differences —&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-08/google-fires-employee-behind-controversial-diversity-memo&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;, Aug 7 2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only way to achieve equality is by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rush.com/songs/the-trees/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hatchet, axe, and saw…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;^ I am confused that an independently wealthy man, who doesn’t live in SV, posting on a global website to a global audience can’t share his true feelings because SIlicon Valley is a singularly intolerant culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go for it. We’re not going to Putin you, man!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Parker Thompson (@pt) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pt/status/933910897566683136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 24, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parker Thompson raises a valid point: Why is it so hard for Tim Ferriss to speak his mind? After all, I just spouted a bunch of crimethink, and I’m but a lowly peon. Tim is independently wealthy; the worst that could happen to him is he loses some Twitter followers, or maybe Silicon Valley’s squawking heads call on tech leaders to cut ties with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to toss these threats around lightly, but remember — rich investors have really fragile egos. Their world revolves around thinking about what the world thinks of them. Self-absorption is one of the key factors to success around here. Why do you think tech leaders spend so much time on Twitter? Heck, why do you think Parker Thompson is virtue-signaling so hard right now? These guys aren’t worried about being persecuted; they’re worried about being ignored. Just like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-29/gross-gets-personal-i-just-wanted-to-run-money-and-be-famous-&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bill Gross&lt;/a&gt;, these people are empty narcissists on a neurotic quest for love. That’s another thing you can’t say in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>CDC gets list of forbidden words</title>
<link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/cdc-gets-list-of-forbidden-words-fetus-transgender-diversity/2017/12/15/f503837a-e1cf-11e7-89e8-edec16379010_story.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/cdc-gets-list-of-forbidden-words-fetus-transgender-diversity/2017/12/15/f503837a-e1cf-11e7-89e8-edec16379010_story.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration is prohibiting officials at the nation’s top public health agency from using a list of seven words or phrases — including “fetus” and “transgender” — in any official documents being prepared for next year’s budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy analysts at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/12/11/new-cdc-head-faces-questions-about-financial-conflicts-of-interest/?utm_term=.cb08b77bb858&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; in Atlanta were told of the list of forbidden words at a meeting Thursday with senior CDC officials who oversee the budget, according to an analyst who took part in the 90-minute briefing. The forbidden words are “vulnerable,” “entitlement,” “diversity,” “transgender,” “fetus,” “evidence-based” and “science-based.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some instances, the analysts were given alternative phrases. Instead of “science-based” or ­“evidence-based,” the suggested phrase is “CDC bases its recommendations on science in consideration with community standards and wishes,” the person said. In other cases, no replacement words were immediately offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of how to address such issues as sexual orientation, gender identity and abortion rights — all of which received significant visibility under the Obama administration — has surfaced repeatedly in federal agencies since President Trump took office. Several key departments — including Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/trump-administration-asks-court-to-toss-out-challenge-to-military-transgender-ban/2017/10/05/3819aec4-a9d5-11e7-92d1-58c702d2d975_story.html?utm_term=.410eba3483e2&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;Justice&lt;/a&gt;, Education, and Housing and Urban Development — have changed some federal policies and how they collect government information about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, for example, HHS dropped questions about sexual orientation and gender identity in two surveys of elderly people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content inline-video&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;inline-video-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;President Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, laid out his vision for the focus of the department on Nov. 29: lowering drug prices, providing affordable, available and tailored health-care plans, reforming Medicare and tackling the opioid epidemic. (Reuters)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HHS has also removed information about LGBT Americans from its website. The department’s Administration for Children and Families, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wayback.archive-it.org/8654/20170329001223/https:/www.acf.hhs.gov/program-topics/lgbt-0&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;archived a page&lt;/a&gt; that outlined federal services that are available for LGBT people and their families, including how they can adopt and receive help if they are the victims of sex trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the CDC, the meeting about the banned words was led by Alison Kelly, a senior leader in the agency’s Office of Financial Services, according to the CDC analyst, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak publicly. Kelly did not say why the words are being banned, according to the analyst, and told the group that she was merely relaying the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other CDC officials confirmed the existence of a list of forbidden words.It’s likely that other parts of HHS are operating under the same guidelines regarding the use of these words, the analyst said&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the CDC, several offices have responsibility for work that uses some of these words. The National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention is working on ways to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/gender/transgender/index.html&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;prevent HIV among transgender&lt;/a&gt; people and reduce health disparities. The CDC’s work on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/04/04/zika-poses-even-greater-risk-for-birth-defects-than-was-previously-known-cdc-reports/?utm_term=.df1bd389a3dc&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;birth defects caused by the Zika&lt;/a&gt; virus includes research on the developing fetus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ban is related to the budget and supporting materials that are to be given to the CDC’s partners and to Congress, the analyst said. The president’s budget for 2019 is expected to be released in early February. The budget blueprint is generally shaped to reflect an administration’s priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal agencies are sending in their budget proposals to the Office of Management and Budget, which has authority about what is included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither an OMB spokesman nor a CDC spokeswoman responded to requests for comment Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p channel=&quot;wp.com&quot; class=&quot;interstitial-link&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-administration-plans-to-minimize-civil-rights-efforts-in-agencies/2017/05/29/922fc1b2-39a7-11e7-a058-ddbb23c75d82_story.html?utm_term=.09139d8115d6&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;This is how the Trump administration has shifted course on civil rights&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longtime CDC analyst, whose job includes writing descriptions of the CDC’s work for the administration’s annual spending blueprint, could not recall a previous time when words were banned from budget documents because they were considered controversial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction of people in the meeting was “incredulous,” the analyst said. “It was very much, ‘Are you serious? Are you kidding?’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In my experience, we’ve never had any pushback from an ideological standpoint,” the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News of the ban on certain words hasn’t yet spread to the broader group of scientists at the CDC, but it’s likely to provoke a backlash, the analyst said. “Our subject matter experts will not lay down quietly — this hasn’t trickled down to them yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC has a budget of about $7 billion and more than 12,000 employees working across the nation and around the globe on everything from food and water safety, to heart disease and cancer, to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/05/26/the-superbug-that-doctors-have-been-dreading-just-reached-the-u-s/?tid=a_inl&amp;amp;utm_term=.fc36279d5c79&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;infectious disease outbreak&lt;/a&gt; prevention. Much of the CDC’s work has strong bipartisan support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelly told the analysts that “certain words” in the CDC’s budget drafts were being sent back to the agency for correction. Three words that had been flagged in these drafts were “vulnerable,” “entitlement” and “diversity.” Kelly told the group the ban on the other words had been conveyed verbally.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Uber Accused of Espionage, Bribery, Hacking, in Former Employee&amp;#039;s Letter</title>
<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanmac/ric-jacobs-uber-letter-allegations-waymo</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanmac/ric-jacobs-uber-letter-allegations-waymo</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The judge in the $1.9 billion civil suit between Alphabet’s self-driving car unit Waymo and Uber released the letter of a disgruntled former employee on Friday, laying bare a number of explosive allegations against the ride-hailing company that include corporate espionage, unlawful surveillance, illegal wiretapping, bribery of foreign officials, and illicit hacking. That document also says that former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, who was ousted in June, directly received stolen trade secrets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That 37-page letter, penned by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanmac/waymo-uber-bombshell-letter-ric-jacobs?utm_term=.vyawyyG8e#.erRezz8bW&quot; data-skimlinks-tracking=&quot;4706322&quot;&gt;former Uber employee Ric Jacobs&lt;/a&gt; and sent to the company in May, became the center of a fierce debate between Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google's parent company Alphabet, and Uber, which did not previously disclose the document to Judge William Alsup. In turn, the federal district judge excoriated Uber’s lawyers in pre-trial hearings in November and suggested that they were attempting to hide something from the court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alsup only recently found out about the letter, after a US attorney investigating Uber for a potential federal case forwarded it to him. The document caused the judge to delay jury selection and the trial until the new year so that the plaintiffs could review the new evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter, available in full to the public for the first time on Friday, contains allegations that could dramatically affect the outcome of Waymo’s case against Uber, and completely shatter the San Francisco-based company’s already frail reputation after a year of scandals. Crucially, it includes a claim that collections of stolen trade secret data were delivered directly to former CEO Travis Kalanick, though it's unclear if that information was related to Waymo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While we haven’t substantiated all the claims in this letter — and, importantly, any related to Waymo — our new leadership has made clear that going forward we will compete honestly and fairly, on the strength of our ideas and technology,” an Uber spokesperson said in a statement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Kalanick declined to comment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In testimony last month, Jacobs walked back on some of the claims in his letter, noting that it was written by his lawyer and that he did not review it in full before it was sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacobs, who now lives in Seattle, left Uber in April after he was allegedly caught trying to download internal documents with the intention of making them public. After his departure, his lawyer sent Uber’s deputy general counsel Angela Padilla the letter detailing what he perceived to be illegal behavior inside the company. During her testimony last month, Padilla called Jacobs’ demands at the time “extortionate,” though Alsup questioned why a company would pay anyone millions of dollars to simply make claims go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber ultimately paid Jacobs $4.5 million in cash and stock in exchange for agreeing not to disparage it in public — though that did not prevent him from testifying — and for his help in resolving the security issues he outlined in his letter. According to his testimony, Jacobs’ settlement prevents him from disparaging Uber in public, though it does not stop him from telling the truth in a court setting. Jacobs remains a consultant for Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacobs and his lawyer Clayton Halunen, who received $3 million as part of the settlement, did not immediately respond to request for comment. Halunen previously told BuzzFeed News that Padilla’s testimony about his client was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanmac/uber-attorney-calls-former-employees-allegations-of?utm_term=.ti23mmDqg#.ownJMMYQ8&quot; data-skimlinks-tracking=&quot;4706322&quot;&gt;“outrageous and possibly defamatory,”&lt;/a&gt; and that the settlement he received was standard per the 40% cut he takes from all contingency cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Below are some of the most contentious allegations in that document, some of which have already been discussed at length in November’s hearings:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;47&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That “not only was Uber able to obtain trade secrets, but used the data it obtained to inflate the ultimate valuation of Uber.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Uber's Marketplace Analytics (MA) team, exists expressly for the purpose of acquiring trade secrets, codebase, and competitive intelligence- including deriving key business metrics of supply, demand, and the function of applications-from major ridesharing competitors globally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2017, a person “contacted Jacobs on Wickr and advised they 'had a bug in a meeting with transport regulators,&quot; and that they ‘needed help cleaning up the audio.’ Jacobs immediately contacted Craig Clark, Uber's then-legal director for threat operations, and informed him of the unlawful request. Clark instructed Jacobs to tell the city team that Uber did not have the technical capabilities to assist, encourage them not to transmit the audio, and convince them to ‘make it go away’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jacobs reasonably believed that bribery of foreign officials was taking place”, but the names of the places where he thought this was happening were redacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber “used undercover agents to collect intelligence against the taxi groups and local political figures. The agents took rides in local taxis, loitered around locations where taxi drivers congregated, and leveraged a local network of contacts with connections to police and regulatory authorities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber &quot;collected details on [redacted], including: information on these firms' connections to political and regulatory officials, their data sharing agreement and connection to the [redacted], their efforts to replace Uber in [redacted], and their investments in the taxi sector in [redacted]. These facts demonstrate that vendors, directed by Uber employees, conducted foreign espionage against a sovereign nation despite Jacobs's objections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacobs felt the things Uber was doing overseas “needlessly exposed Uber and its employees to severe risk — including the likely termination of Uber's operations and possible imprisonment of its employees — should capable security services in many overseas locations discover Uber's espionage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacobs wanted to create a “secure and encrypted database to ensure confidentiality and presented a draft proposal” to his managers. However, “discussions broke down immediately as the group objected to preserving any intelligence that would make preservation and legal discovery a simple process for future litigants.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;Jacobs questioned the legality of collecting intelligence necessary for the analysis, which targeted politicians, regulators, and taxi union officials.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In January 2017, Jacobs informed Clark, as discussed above, that a [redacted] team member had illegally bugged a meeting. Clark did nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, Jacobs was demoted without warning, which he felt was a direct response to his unwillingness to engage in illegal activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Since his termination, Jacobs has learned that, rather than conduct a legitimate investigation, CEO Travis Kalanick informed several of the implicated parties about Jacobs' claims prior to any legitimate investigation. This is largely the reason that Jacobs does not feel Uber has acted in good faith, and why he does not wish to sit down for a formal interview.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber may have improperly recorded a phone call with employees &quot;following allegations of of sexual harassment by a former Uber employee. Uber did not tell the participants that the call was being recorded and accordingly had not received permission from the call participants to record it, as required by California law.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber hired at least one CIA-trained contractor to collect &quot;mobile-phone metadata either directly through signal-intercept equipment, hacked mobile devices, or through the mobile network itself. The information eventually shared with Jacobs and others included call logs, with time and date of communications, communicants' phone numbers, call durations, and the identification of the mobile phone subscribers.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uber accessed a protected computer database to lure drivers away to work for the company even though &quot;the database was protected by 'Captcha' to prevent the sort of automated downloading that Uber's MA team intended to carry out. MA was ultimately successful in hacking the system and obtaining the driver database. Because Uber knowingly accessed a protected computer in order to fraudulently capture its valuable contents to gain a competitive advantage, the hack violates the [Computer Fraud and Abuse Act], as well as California Penal Code Section 502.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When asked last month by Waymo’s lawyer on whether he was aware of a unit within Uber stealing trade secrets, something he outlined in his lawyer’s letter, Jacobs distanced himself the claims. “I don’t stand by that statement,” Jacobs testified when asked about a passage in the letter that discussed an Uber employee recruiting job candidates with sensitive information from competitors. A lawyer for Jacobs also filed a motion last month in an attempt to prevent the letter from being viewed by the general public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There's hyperbolic language in here or things that I would not have stated in the same manner, but… I did not write the letter,” Jacobs said in court, placing the responsibility for the document on his previous lawyer, Halunen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a November 29 email to employees, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi wrote, “With regard to the allegations outlined in Ric Jacobs’ letter, I can tell you that we have not been able to substantiate every one of his claims, including any related to Waymo. But I will also say that there is more than enough there to merit serious concern.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Clark, who was fired from the company last month for his role in covering up an October 2016 incident in which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanmac/uber-says-hackers-compromised-57-million-accounts-a-year&quot; data-skimlinks-tracking=&quot;4706322&quot;&gt;Uber was hacked&lt;/a&gt;, also denied that his client did anything wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;He has never been allowed to see Mr. Jacobs’ letter and looks forward to addressing it at the appropriate time,&quot; Mark Howitson, Clark's attorney, said in a statement. &quot;Mr. Jacobs' testimony on the content of his letter speaks for itself.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also on Friday, a court administrator issued an opinion on the matter of the Jacobs letter, stating that Uber knew of the letter’s existence and should have released it as part of the previous discovery process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The facts in this case suggest that Ms. Padilla knew of the Jacobs Letter at the time Uber had to respond to discovery requests calling for its production — it certainly was ‘reasonably accessible’,” the filing reads. “Mr. Jacobs’ correspondence alleged systemic, institutionalized, and criminal efforts by Uber to conceal evidence and steal trade secrets…”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alsup can now respond to this finding, and could potentially choose to sanction Uber’s legal team for its failure to produce the document.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>MobileCoin: A New Cryptocurrency from Moxie Marlinspike</title>
<link>https://www.wired.com/story/mobilecoin-cryptocurrency/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.wired.com/story/mobilecoin-cryptocurrency/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;In the early&lt;/span&gt; bitcoin years, proponents promised that you would soon be able to pay for anything and everything with cryptocurrency. Order &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2011/11/mf_bitcoin/&quot;&gt;pizza&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techrepublic.com/article/pay-with-bitcoin-10-of-the-most-interesting-places-to-spend-it/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Buy Etsy&lt;/a&gt; trinkets! Use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2014/01/bitcoin_atm/&quot;&gt;bitcoin ATM&lt;/a&gt;! While PayPal had existed for more than a decade, frictionless, social payment platforms like Venmo were just first taking off, and cryptocurrency seemed like a legitimate way for digital transactions to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn't happen. Cryptocurrency remains confusing and challenging for the average person to acquire and manage, much less &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TedOnPrivacy/status/940588631709896704&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sell&lt;/a&gt;. And the protocols that underlie bitcoin and other mainstream cryptocurrencies like ethereum suffer significant scalability and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/bitcoin-is-soaring-heres-why-its-not-ready-for-the-big-time/&quot;&gt;transaction bottleneck issues&lt;/a&gt;. Visa currently processes about 3,674 transactions per second; the best bitcoin network &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be able to process seven per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now the creator of the dead simple end-to-end encrypted messaging app &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/tag/signal&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2016/07/meet-moxie-marlinspike-anarchist-bringing-encryption-us/&quot;&gt;Moxie Marlinspike&lt;/a&gt;, is on a mission to overcome those limitations, and to create a streamlined digital currency that's private, easy-to-use, and allows for quick transactions from any device. And while it may feel like the last thing the world needs is yet another cryptocurrency, Marlinspike's track record with Signal—and the organization behind it, Open Whisper Systems—makes this a project worth watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Coin Toss&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currency Marlinspike has been working on as technical advisor for the last four months, alongside technologist Joshua Goldbard, is MobileCoin. The two based it on the open-source Stellar Consensus Protocols platform, an alternative payment network that underlies systems like an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stellar.org/blog/IBM-KlickEx-Partnership/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;inter-bank payment network run by IBM&lt;/a&gt; in the South Pacific, and the low-fee international &lt;a href=&quot;https://tempo.eu.com/en/news/post/15&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;money transfer service Tempo&lt;/a&gt; in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;inset-left-component inset-left-component--pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;inset-left&quot; class=&quot;inset-left-component__el&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Usability is the biggest challenge with cryptocurrency today.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;inset-left&quot; class=&quot;inset-left-component__el&quot;&gt;Signal Creator Moxie Marlinspike&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stellar blockchain is also generally regarded as being faster and more efficient than its predecessors; On Wednesday, the mobile messaging service Kik &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qePiRXQE3Jk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will move its Kin cryptocurrency platform from Ethereum to Stellar. &quot;We've been using Ethereum to date, and to be honest I call it the dial-up era of blockchain,&quot; CEO Ted Livingston said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MobileCoin wants to leverage an extensive architecture to add simplicity to real privacy protections and resilience against attacks. The ultimate goal: To make MobileCoin as intuitive as any other payment system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That vision mirrors the animating purpose of Signal, which was developed to make robust end-to-end encrypted communication as easy and straightforward as less secure options, a simple experience that belies the complex cryptographic communication protocols that enable it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think usability is the biggest challenge with cryptocurrency today,&quot; says Marlinspike. &quot;The innovations I want to see are ones that make cryptocurrency deployable in normal environments, without sacrificing the properties that distinguish cryptocurrency from existing payment mechanisms.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Usability efforts for older generation cryptocurrency protocols, like bitcoin, have largely been left to services like Coinbase, which centralize everything from currency exchange to your wallet, key management, and processing transactions. These platforms make actually using cryptocurrency more realistic for the average person, but they also consolidate mechanisms that are meant to be kept separate in the private and decentralized concept of cryptocurrency. They generally detail extensive privacy and security protections, but they do require users to trust both their intentions and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the idea of MobileCoin is to build a system that hides everything from everyone, leaving fewer (or theoretically no) opportunities for abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;On the Node&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, there would be a way to fix the structural problems of existing cryptocurrencies, rather than creating another new offering. But Marlinspike and Goldbard concluded that the only way to orient a cryptocurrency around user needs was to start from scratch, and architect everything with that &quot;target user experience&quot; in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, MobileCoin delegates all the complicated and processing-intensive work of participating in a blockchain ledger and validating transactions to nodes—servers with constant connectivity that store and work on a fully updated copy of a currency's blockchain. The nodes can then provide software services to users, like apps that seamlessly integrate easy and quick MobileCoin transactions. The nodes also handle key management for users, so the public—and particularly the private—numeric sequences that encrypt each person's transactions are stored and used by the node. But crucially MobileCoin is designed so the node operators can never directly access users' private keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inset-left-component inset-left-component--pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;9.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;inset-left&quot; class=&quot;inset-left-component__el&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'If you can’t look at the ledger, how can you cheat it?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;inset-left&quot; class=&quot;inset-left-component__el&quot;&gt;Joshua Goldbard, MobileCoin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the special features of MobileCoin come in. The currency is designed to utilize an Intel processor component known as Software Guard Extensions, or a &quot;secure enclave.&quot; SGX is a sequestered portion of a processor that runs code like any other, but the software inside it can't be accessed or changed by a device's broader operating system. Computers can still check that an enclave is running the right software to validate it before connecting, but neither MobileCoin users nor node administrators can decrypt and view the enclave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For MobileCoin, the enclaves in all of the nodes of the network hide the currency's indelible ledger from view. Users' private keys are stored and shielded in the enclave, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you put the cryptocurrency inside of the secure enclave, then people can run the nodes without seeing what’s happening inside them,&quot; Goldbard says. &quot;If you can’t look at the ledger, how can you cheat it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marlinspike first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/signal-contact-lists-private-secure-enclave/&quot;&gt;experimented with SGX for Signal&lt;/a&gt; as a workaround so users can find people they know on Signal through their address books without exposing all of that data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secure enclaves create some technical challenges, because they have limited processing capacity. But MobileCoin is designed with efficiency in mind. The system does as much data processing as possible outside the enclave, and only uses SGX for sensitive computing that needs to be shielded. And not needing to trust the nodes—because sensitive data isn't exposed on them—means that more can happen off of a user's device without sacrificing privacy, making transactions quick and easy on mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;MobileCoin is designed to be deployable in normal resource-constrained environments like mobile devices, and to deliver a simple user experience along with privacy and security,&quot; Marlinspike says. &quot;The design gives you the benefits of server assistance without the downsides of having to trust a server to act appropriately and not be hacked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The platform has other protections layered with SGX as well. Even if someone compromised a MobileCoin enclave and could view the transaction ledger, one-time addresses and special one-time signatures for each transaction would still prevent an attacker from being able to trace and link events. And a privacy bonus of the Stellar Consensus Protocol is that the nodes don't need to store a full transaction history in the blockchain; they can discard most data after each payment is completed. These components make MobileCoin more resistant to surveillance, whether it's coming from a government or a criminal who wants to track and extort users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting Practical&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of potential applications for MobileCoin, but Goldbard and Marlinspike envision it first as an integration in chat apps like Signal or WhatsApp. Here's how it would work in practice: To start using MobileCoin, you would generate a public and private key, and a recovery PIN. Then you would set up your account with an app that incorporates MobileCoin. The app would validate the software running in its service's node, establish an encrypted communication channel to the enclave, and then send your keys and the short, easy-to-remember recovery PIN that you'll use to access your MobileCoin—like a smartphone lock passcode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To send MobileCoin to your friend Brian within a service that both of you use, your app would look up his public key, generate a one-time key and signature to use for the transaction, and send the transaction to the app's MobileCoin node. The node would sync and validate the transaction, update the ledger, and check the one-time key and signature to prevent spoofed double-spending. At this point Brian's MobileCoin node would take over, receiving and validating the transaction and communicating with Brian's app to generate the one-time private key that will allow Brian to receive the payment. And then Brian gets a notification that you paid him. The messaging app (or whatever service you're both using) doubles as a wallet for each of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a complicated process to wade through. The point of MobileCoin, though, is that you and Brian don't have to worry about any of it. The complicated parts all take place in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobilecoin.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MobileCoin site&lt;/a&gt;, where developers looking to adopt the cryptocurrency will ultimately be able to access the software development kit, currently houses a white paper describing how MobileCoin works in more detail. But Goldbard says that the currency is still six months to a year from release, while he and Marlinspike refine the platform to eliminate potential problems, like the possibility that secure enclaves can inadvertently leak data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means there are still plenty of questions to be answered, including one big one: whether MobileCoin will be able to cut through all the noise and hype of the cryptocurrency community to actually be adopted by mainstream apps that could put it in everyone's hands. Currencies, after all, need a critical mass of people to not just be able to use them, but to agree on their worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And though speculation has driven bitcoin to all-time-high valuations, most cryptocurrencies don't end up capturing much value, languishing instead in far-flung corners of the internet. Here again, though, MobileCoin's creators hope to emulate Signal. End-to-end encryption was once a fringe feature; then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2016/04/forget-apple-vs-fbi-whatsapp-just-switched-encryption-billion-people/&quot;&gt;WhatsApp gave it to a billion people at once&lt;/a&gt; using the Signal Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nobody actually transacts in cryptocurrency,&quot; Goldbard says. &quot;So making something that people can actually use is our first goal. And then we want to find additional ways that people can implement it over time. But initially all we want is to make it so people can actually complete transactions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it works, the project will give hope to people who once believed cryptocurrency could truly replace cash in modern society—even if you're only buying a pizza.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Overcoming Us vs. Them</title>
<link>http://nautil.us/issue/55/trust/why-your-brain-hates-other-people-rp</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://nautil.us/issue/55/trust/why-your-brain-hates-other-people-rp</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;s a kid, I saw the 1968 version of &lt;em&gt;Planet of the Apes&lt;/em&gt;. As a future primatologist, I was mesmerized. Years later I discovered an anecdote about its filming: At lunchtime, the people playing chimps and those playing gorillas ate in separate groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been said, “There are two kinds of people in the world: those who divide the world into two kinds of people and those who don’t.” In reality, there’s lots more of the former. And it can be vastly consequential when people are divided into Us and Them, ingroup and outgroup, “the people” (i.e., our kind) and the Others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core of Us/Them-ing is emotional and automatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans universally make Us/Them dichotomies along lines of race, ethnicity, gender, language group, religion, age, socioeconomic status, and so on. And it’s not a pretty picture. We do so with remarkable speed and neurobiological efficiency; have complex taxonomies and classifications of ways in which we denigrate Thems; do so with a versatility that ranges from the minutest of microaggression to bloodbaths of savagery; and regularly decide what is inferior about Them based on pure emotion, followed by primitive rationalizations that we mistake for rationality. Pretty depressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But crucially, there is room for optimism. Much of that is grounded in something definedly human, which is that we all carry multiple Us/Them divisions in our heads. A Them in one case can be an Us in another, and it can only take an instant for that identity to flip. Thus, there is hope that, with science’s help, clannishness and xenophobia can lessen, perhaps even so much so that Hollywood-extra chimps and gorillas can break bread together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Strength of Us Versus Them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considerable evidence suggests that dividing the world into Us and Them is deeply hard-wired in our brains, with an ancient evolutionary legacy. For starters, we detect Us/Them differences with stunning speed. Stick someone in a “functional MRI”—a brain scanner that indicates activity in various brain regions under particular circumstances. Flash up pictures of faces for 50 milliseconds—a 20th of a second—barely at the level of detection. And remarkably, with even such minimal exposure, the brain processes faces of Thems differently than Us-es.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.nautil.us/12553_3d9728c728f49af2642c560be7cc3f79.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been studied extensively with the inflammatory Us/Them of race. Briefly flash up the face of someone of a different race (compared with a same-race face) and, on average, there is preferential activation of the amygdala, a brain region associated with fear, anxiety, and aggression. Moreover, other-race faces cause less activation than do same-race faces in the fusiform cortex, a region specializing in facial recognition; along with that comes less accuracy at remembering other-race faces. Watching a film of a hand being poked with a needle causes an “isomorphic reflex,” where the part of the motor cortex corresponding to your own hand activates, and your hand clenches—unless the hand is of another race, in which case less of this effect is produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain’s fault lines dividing Us from Them are also shown with the hormone oxytocin. It’s famed for its pro-social effects—oxytocin prompts people to be more trusting, cooperative, and generous. But, crucially, this is how oxytocin influences behavior toward members of your &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; group. When it comes to outgroup members, it does the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automatic, unconscious nature of Us/Them-ing attests to its depth. This can be demonstrated with the fiendishly clever Implicit Association Test. Suppose you’re deeply prejudiced against trolls, consider them inferior to humans. To simplify, this can be revealed with the Implicit Association Test, where subjects look at pictures of humans or trolls, coupled with words with positive or negative connotations. The couplings can support the direction of your biases (e.g., a human face and the word “honest,” a troll face and the word “deceitful”), or can run counter to your biases. And people take slightly longer, a fraction of a second, to process discordant pairings. It’s automatic—you’re not fuming about clannish troll business practices or troll brutality in the Battle of Somewhere in 1523. You’re processing words and pictures, and your anti-troll bias makes you unconsciously pause, stopped by the dissonance linking troll with “lovely,” or human with “malodorous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re not alone in Us/Them-ing. It’s no news that other primates can make violent Us/Them distinctions; after all, chimps band together and systematically kill the males in a neighboring group. Recent work, adapting the Implicit Association Test to another species, suggests that even other primates have implicit negative associations with Others. Rhesus monkeys would look at pictures either of members of their own group or strangers, coupled with pictures of things with positive or negative connotations. And monkeys would look longer at pairings discordant with their biases (e.g., pictures of members of their own group with pictures of spiders). These monkeys don’t just fight neighbors over resources. They have negative associations about them—“Those guys are like yucky spiders, but us, us, we’re like luscious fruit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the strength of Us/Them-ing is shown by the: speed and minimal sensory stimuli required for the brain to process group differences; tendency to group according to arbitrary differences, and then imbue those differences with supposedly rational power; unconscious automaticity of such processes; and rudiments of it in other primates. As we’ll see now, we tend to think of Us, but not Thems, fairly straightforwardly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Nature of Us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across cultures and throughout history, people who comprise Us are viewed in similarly self-congratulatory ways—We are more correct, wise, moral, and worthy. Us-ness also involves inflating the merits of our arbitrary markers, which can take some work—rationalizing why our food is tastier, our music more moving, our language more logical or poetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Us-ness also carries obligations toward the other guy—for example, in studies in sports stadiums, a researcher posing as a fan, complete with sweatshirt supporting one of the teams and in need of help with something, is more likely to be helped by a fellow fan than by an opposing one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ingroup favoritism raises a key question—at our core, do we want Us to do “well” by maximizing absolute levels of well being, or merely “better than,” by maximizing the gap between Us and Them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We typically claim to wish for the former, but can smolder with desire for the latter. This can be benign—in a tight pennant race, a loss for the hated rival to a third party is as good as a win for the home team, and for sectarian sports fans, both outcomes similarly activate brain pathways associated with reward and the neurotransmitter dopamine. But sometimes, choosing “better than” over “well” can be disastrous. It’s not a great mindset to think you’ve won World War III if afterward Us have two mud huts and three fire sticks and They have only one of each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.nautil.us/12554_6644cb08d30b2ca55c284344a9750c2e.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the most pro-social things we do for ingroup members is readily forgive them for transgressions. When a Them does something wrong, it reflects essentialism—that’s the way They are, always have been, always will be. When an Us is in the wrong, however, the pull is toward situational interpretations—we’re not usually like that, and here’s the extenuating circumstance to explain why he did this. Situational explanations for misdeeds are the reason why defense lawyers want jurors who will view the defendant as an Us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something interesting and different can happen when someone’s transgression airs Us’s dirty laundry, affirming a negative stereotype. Ingroup shame can provoke intense punishment for the benefit of outsiders. Consider Rudy Giuliani, growing up in Brooklyn in an Italian-American enclave dominated by organized crime (Giuliani’s father served time for armed robbery and then worked for a mob loan shark). Giuliani gained prominence in 1985 as the attorney prosecuting the “Five Families” in the Mafia Commission Trial, effectively destroying them. He was strongly motivated to counter the stereotype of “Italian-American” as synonymous with organized crime—“If [the successful prosecution is] not enough to remove the Mafia prejudice, then there probably could not be anything you could do to remove it.” If you want someone to ferociously prosecute Mafiosi, get a proud Italian-American outraged by the stereotypes generated by the mob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, being an Us carries an array of ingroup expectations and obligations. Is it possible to switch from one category of Us to another? That’s easy in, say, sports—when a player is traded he doesn’t serve as a fifth column, throwing games in his new uniform to benefit his old team. The core of such a contractual relationship is the fungibility of employer and employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the other extreme are Us memberships that are not fungible, transcending negotiation. People aren’t traded from the Shiites to the Sunnis, or from the Iraqi Kurds to the Sami herders in Finland. It’s a rare Kurd who wants to be Sami, and her ancestors would likely turn over in their graves when she nuzzled her first reindeer. Converts are often subject to retribution by those they left—consider Meriam Ibrahim, sentenced to death in Sudan in 2014 for converting to Christianity—and suspicion from those they joined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Nature of Them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we think or feel our way toward disliking Them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Us/Them-ing is readily framed cognitively. Ruling classes do cognitive cartwheels to justify the status quo. Likewise, it’s a cognitive challenge to accommodate the celebrity Them, the neighborly Them who has saved our keister—“Ah, this Them is different.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viewing Thems in certain threatening ways requires cognitive subtlety. Being afraid that some Them will rob you is rife with affect and particularism. But fearing that those Thems will take our jobs, manipulate the banks, dilute our bloodlines, etc., requires thoughts about economics, sociology, and pseudoscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.nautil.us/12547_a3fc34dce15cda93287496c84af5203c.png&quot; width=&quot;733&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it’s negotiable:&lt;/strong&gt; When a Confederate general was wounded during the U.S. Civil War, he gave a secret Masonic sign that was recognized by a Union officer, who protected him and took him to a Union hospital.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Stock Montage / Contributor / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite that role of cognition, the core of Us/Them-ing is emotional and automatic, as summarized by when we say, “I can’t put my finger on why, but it’s just wrong when They do that.” Jonathan Haidt of New York University has shown that often, cognitions are post-hoc justifications for feelings and intuitions, to convince ourselves that we have indeed rationally put our finger on why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be shown with neuroimaging studies. As noted, when fleetingly seeing the face of a Them, the amygdala activates. Critically, this comes long before (on the time scale of brain processing) more cognitive, cortical regions are processing the Them. The emotions come first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dividing the world into Us and Them is deeply hard-wired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strongest evidence that abrasive Them-ing originates in emotional, automatic processes is that supposed rational cognitions about Thems can be unconsciously manipulated. Just consider this array of findings: Show subjects slides about some obscure country; afterward, they will have more negative attitudes toward the place if, between slides, pictures of faces with expressions of fear appeared at subliminal speeds. Sitting near smelly garbage makes people more socially conservative about outgroup issues (e.g., attitudes toward gay marriage among heterosexuals). Christians express more negative attitudes toward non-Christians if they’ve just walked past a church. In another study, commuters at train stations in predominantly white suburbs filled out questionnaires about political views. Then, at half the stations, a pair of young Mexicans, conservatively dressed and chatting quietly, appeared daily on the platform for two weeks. Then commuters filled out second questionnaires. Remarkably, the presence of such pairs made people more supportive of decreasing &lt;em&gt;legal&lt;/em&gt; immigration from Mexico and making English the official language, and more opposed to amnesty for undocumented immigrants (without changing attitudes about Asian-Americans, African-Americans or Middle Easterners). Women, when ovulating, have more negative attitudes about outgroup men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, our visceral, emotional views of Thems are shaped by subterranean forces we’d never suspect. And then our cognitions sprint to catch up with our affective selves, generating the minute factoid or plausible fabrication that explains why we hate Them. It’s a kind of confirmation bias: remembering supportive better than opposing evidence; testing things in ways that can support but not negate your hypothesis; skeptically probing outcomes you don’t like more than ones you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Heterogeneity of Thems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, different types of Thems evoke different feelings (and different neurobiological responses). Most common is to view Them as threatening, angry, and untrustworthy. In economic games people implicitly treat other-race individuals as less trustworthy or reciprocating. Whites judge African-American faces as angrier than white faces, and are more likely to categorize racially ambiguous angry faces as the other race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.nautil.us/12555_04c7f37f2420f0532d7f0e062ff2d5b5.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Thems do not solely evoke a sense of menace; sometimes, it’s disgust. This brings up one fascinating brain region, the insula. In mammals, it responds to the taste or smell of something rotten, and triggers stomach lurching and gag reflexes. In other words, it protects animals from poisonous food. Crucially, in humans the insula not only mediates such sensory disgust, but also moral disgust—have subjects recount something rotten they’ve done, show them pictures of morally appalling things (e.g., a lynching), and the insula activates. It’s why it’s not just metaphorical that sufficiently morally disgusting material makes us feel sick to our stomachs. And Thems that typically evoke a sense of disgust (e.g. drug addicts) activate the insula at least as much as the amygdala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having viscerally negative feelings about abstract features of Thems is challenging; being disgusted by another group’s abstract beliefs isn’t easy for the insula. Us/Them markers provide a stepping-stone. Feeling disgusted by Them because they eat repulsive, sacred, or adorable things, slather themselves with rancid scents, dress in scandalous ways—this the insula can sink its teeth into. In the words of the psychologist Paul Rozin of the University of Pennsylvania, “Disgust serves as an ethnic or outgroup marker.” Deciding that They eat disgusting things facilitates deciding that They also have disgusting ideas about, say, deontological ethics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are Thems who are ridiculous, i.e., subject to ridicule, humor as hostility. Outgroups mocking the ingroup is a weapon of the weak, lessening the sting of subordination. But when an ingroup mocks an outgroup, it solidifies negative stereotypes and reifies the hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thems are also frequently viewed as more homogeneous than Us, with simpler emotions and less sensitivity to pain. For example, whether in ancient Rome, medieval England, imperial China, or the antebellum South, the elite had system-justifying stereotypes of slaves as simple, childlike, and incapable of independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, different Thems come in different flavors with immutable, icky essences—threatening and angry, disgusting and repellent, ridiculous, primitive, and undifferentiated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cold and/or Incompetent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important work by Susan Fiske of Princeton University explores the taxonomies of Thems we carry in our heads. She finds that we tend to categorize Thems along two axes: “warmth” (is the individual or group a friend or foe, benevolent or malevolent?) and “competence” (how effectively can the individual or group carry out their intentions?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The axes are independent. Ask subjects to assess someone; priming them with cues about the person’s status alters ratings of competence but not of warmth. Priming about the person’s competitiveness does the opposite. These two axes produce a matrix with four corners. We rate ourselves as high in both warmth and competence (H/H), naturally. Americans typically rate good Christians, African-American professionals, and the middle class this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s the other extreme, low in both warmth and competence (L/L). Such ratings go to the homeless or addicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the high-warmth/low-competence (H/L) realm—the mentally disabled, people with handicaps, infirm elderly. Low warmth/high competence (L/H) is how people in the developing world tend to view the Europeans who colonized them (“competence” here is not about skill at rocket science, but rather the efficacy those people had when getting it into their heads to, say, steal your ancestral lands), and how many minority Americans view whites. It’s the hostile stereotype of Asian-Americans by white America, of Jews in Europe, of Indo-Pakistanis in East Africa, of Lebanese in West Africa, of ethnic Chinese in Indonesia, and of the rich by the poor most everywhere—they’re cold, greedy, clannish but, dang, go to one who is a doctor if you’re seriously sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between envy and disgust are our most hostile urges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each extreme tends to evoke consistent feelings. For H/H (i.e., Us), there’s pride. L/H—envy and resentment. H/L—pity. L/L—disgust. Viewing pictures of L/L people activates the amygdala and insula, but not the fusiform face area; this is the same profile evoked by a picture of, say, a maggot-infested wound. In contrast, viewing L/H or H/L individuals activates emotional and cognitive parts of the frontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The places between the extremes evoke their own characteristic responses. Individuals who evoke a reaction between pity and pride evoke a desire to help. Floating between pity and disgust is a desire to exclude and demean. Between pride and envy is a desire to associate, to derive benefits from. And between envy and disgust are our most hostile urges to attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What fascinates me is when someone’s categorization changes. Most straightforward are shifts from high-warmth/high-competence (H/H) status:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;H/H to H/L&lt;/em&gt;: A parent declining into dementia, evoking poignant protectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;H/H to L/H&lt;/em&gt;: The business partner who turns out to have embezzled for decades. Betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;H/H to L/L&lt;/em&gt;: The rare instance of that successful acquaintance, where “something happened” and now he’s homeless. Disgust mingled with bafflement—what went wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s L/L to L/H. When I was a kid in the ’60s, the parochial American view of Japan was the former—World War II’s shadow generating dislike and contempt, and “Made in Japan” was about cheap plastic gewgaws. Then, suddenly, “Made in Japan” meant outcompeting American automakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a homeless guy does cartwheels to return someone’s lost wallet—and you realize he’s more decent than your friends—that’s L/L to H/L.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.nautil.us/12548_194585b5215aea447389c5fefca09c61.png&quot; width=&quot;733&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most interesting to me is L/H to L/L, which invokes gleeful gloating, helping to explain why persecution of L/H groups usually involves degrading and humiliating them to L/L status. During China’s Cultural Revolution, resented elites were first paraded in dunce caps before exile to labor camps. Nazis eliminated the mentally ill, already viewed as L/L, by unceremoniously murdering them; in contrast, pre-murder treatment of the L/H Jews involved forcing them to wear degrading yellow armbands, cutting one another’s beards, scrubbing sidewalks with toothbrushes before jeering crowds. When Idi Amin expelled tens of thousands of L/H Indo-Pakistani citizens from Uganda in the 1970s, he first invited his army to rob, beat, and rape them. Turning L/H Thems into L/L Thems accounts for some of our worst savagery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complexities in our categorization of Thems abound. There’s the phenomenon of the grudging respect, even a sense of camaraderie with an enemy, the perhaps apocryphal picture of World War I flying aces, where a glimmer of Us-ness is shared with someone trying to kill you (“Ah, monsieur, if it were another time, I would delight in discussing aeronautics with you over some good wine.” “Baron, it is an honor that it is you who shoots me out of the sky”). And there’s the intricacies of differing feelings about economic versus cultural enemies, new versus ancient ones, or the distant alien enemy versus the familiar one next door (consider Ho Chi Minh, rejecting the offer of help from Chinese troops during the Vietnam War, stating to the effect of “The Americans will leave in a year or a decade, but the Chinese will stay for a thousand years if we let them in”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there is the profoundly strange phenomenon of the self-hating ________ (take your pick of the outgroup member), who has bought into the negative stereotypes and favors the ingroup. This was shown by psychologists Kenneth and Mamie Clark in their heart-breaking “doll studies,” in the 1940s, demonstrating how African-American children, along with white children, preferred playing with white dolls over black ones, ascribing more positive attributes to them (e.g., nice, pretty). That this effect was most pronounced in black kids in segregated schools was cited in &lt;em&gt;Brown v. Board of Education&lt;/em&gt;. Or consider the scenario of the strident crusader against gay rights who turns out to be closeted—the Mobius strip pathology of accepting that you are an inferior Them. We put monkeys, even with their complexities of associating alien monkeys with spiders, to shame when it comes to the psychological vagaries of dividing the world into Us and Them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple Us-es&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also recognize that other individuals belong to multiple categories, and shift which we consider most relevant. Not surprisingly, lots of that literature concerns race, exploring whether it is an Us/Them categorization that trumps all others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primacy of race has folk-intuition appeal. First, race is a biological attribute, a conspicuous fixed identity that readily prompts essentialist thinking. Moreover, humans evolved under conditions where different skin color conspicuously signals that someone is a distant Them. Furthermore, a large percentage of cultures, long before Western contact, make status distinctions by skin color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, evidence is to the contrary. First, while there are obvious biological contributions to racial differences, “race” is a biological continuum rather than discrete categories—for example, unless you cherry-pick the data, genetic variation within race is generally as great as between races. And this really is no surprise when looking at the range of variation within a racial rubric—go compare, say, Sicilians with Swedes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, race fails as a fixed classification system. At various times in U.S. census history, “Mexican” and “Armenian” were considered races; southern Italians and northern Europeans were classified differently; someone with one black great-grandparent and seven white ones was “white” in Oregon but not Florida. This is race as a cultural construct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article-author&quot;&gt;By Leela Corman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leela Corman is an illustrator, cartoonist, and dancer. Originally from New York, she and her husband, the cartoonist Tom Hart, and their daughter Molly Rose, now reside in Gainesville, Florida, where they operate the Sequential Artists Workshop, a school...&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nautil.us/issue/23/Dominoes/ptsd-the-wound-that-never-heals&quot; class=&quot;obnd_lnk&quot; data-trval=&quot;ptsd-the-wound-that-never-heals&quot; data-trlbl=&quot;foc_rec&quot; data-tract=&quot;internal_art&quot;&gt;READ MORE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s not surprising that racial Us/Them dichotomies are frequently trumped by other classifications. In one study, subjects saw pictures of individuals, each black or white, each associated with a statement, and then had to recall which face went with which statement. There was automatic racial categorization—if subjects misattributed a quote, the correct and incorrect faces were likely to be of the same race. Next, half the blacks and whites pictured wore the same distinctive yellow shirt; the other half wore gray. Now subjects most often confused statements by shirt color. Furthermore, gender reclassification particularly overrides unconscious racial categorization. After all, while races have evolved relatively recently in hominid history (probably over the course of just a few tens of thousands of years), our ancestors, almost all the way back to when they were paramecia, cared about Boy or Girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important research by Mary Wheeler along with Fiske showed how categorization is shifted, studying other-race/amygdala activation. When subjects are instructed to look for a distinctive dot in each picture, other-race faces don’t activate the amygdala; face-ness wasn’t being processed. Judging whether each face looked older than some age wasn’t a recategorization that could eliminate the other-race amygdaloid response. But for a third group of subjects, a vegetable was displayed before each face; subjects judged whether the person liked that vegetable. And the amygdala didn’t respond to other-race faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? You look at the Them, thinking about what food she’d like. You picture her shopping, or ordering a meal in a restaurant. Best case scenario, you decide you and she share some vegetable preference—a smidgen of Us-ness. Worst case, you decide you two differ, a relatively benign Them—history is not stained with blood spilled by animosities between partisans for broccoli versus cauliflower. Most importantly, as you imagine her sitting at dinner, enjoying that food, you are thinking of her as an &lt;em&gt;individual&lt;/em&gt;, the surest way to weaken automatic categorization of someone as a Them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid recategorizations can occur in the most brutal, unlikely, and intensely poignant circumstances:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Battle of Gettysburg, Confederate general Lewis Armistead was mortally wounded. As he lay on the battlefield, he gave a secret Masonic sign, hoping it would be recognized by a fellow Mason. It was, by Union officer Hiram Bingham, who protected him, and got him to a Union field hospital. In an instant the Us/Them of Union/Confederate faded before Mason/non-Mason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During World War II, British commandos kidnapped German general Heinrich Kreipe in Crete, followed by a dangerous 18-day march to the coast to rendezvous with a British ship. One day the party saw the snows of Crete’s highest peak. Kreipe mumbled to himself the first line (in Latin) of an ode by Horace about a snowcapped mountain. At which point the British commander, Patrick Leigh Fermor, continued the recitation. The two men realized that they had, in Leigh Fermor’s words, “drunk at the same fountains.” A recategorization. Leigh Fermor had Kreipe’s wounds treated and personally ensured his safety. The two stayed in touch after the war and were reunited decades later on Greek television. “No hard feelings,” said Kreipe, praising their “daring operation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally there is the World War I Christmas truce, where opposing trench soldiers spent the day singing, praying, and partying together, playing soccer, and exchanging gifts, where soldiers up and down the lines struggled to extend the truce. It took all of one day for British-versus-German to yield to something more important—&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of us in the trenches versus the officers in the rear who want us to kill each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have multiple dichotomies in our heads, and ones that seem inevitable and crucial can, under the right circumstances, evaporate in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lessening the Impact of Us/Them-ing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how can we &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; these dichotomies evaporate? Some thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt;: The consequences of growing up amid diversity just discussed bring us to the effects of prolonged contact on Us/Theming. In the 1950s the psychologist Gordon Allport proposed “contact theory.” Inaccurate version: bring Us-es and Thems together (say, teenagers from two hostile nations in a summer camp), animosities disappear, similarities start to outweigh differences, everyone becomes an Us. More accurate version: put Us and Thems together under narrow circumstances and something sort of resembling that happens, but you can also blow it and worsen things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the effective narrower circumstances: each side has roughly equal numbers; everyone’s treated equally and unambiguously; contact is lengthy and on neutral territory; there are “superordinate” goals where everyone works together on a meaningful task (say, summer campers turning a meadow into a soccer field).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even then, effects are typically limited—Us-es and Thems quickly lose touch, changes are transient and often specific—“I hate those Thems, but I know one from last summer who’s actually a good guy.” Where contact really causes fundamental change is when it is prolonged. Then we’re making progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Approaching the implicit&lt;/em&gt;: If you want to lessen an implicit Us/Them response, one good way is priming beforehand with a counter-stereotype (e.g., a reminder of a beloved celebrity Them). Another approach is making the implicit explicit—show people their implicit biases. Another is a powerful cognitive tool—perspective taking. Pretend you’re a Them and explain your grievances. How would you feel? Would your feet hurt after walking a mile in their shoes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Replace essentialism with individuation&lt;/em&gt;: In one study, white subjects were asked about their acceptance of racial inequalities. Half were first primed toward essentialist thinking, being told, “Scientists pinpoint the genetic underpinnings of race.” Half heard an anti-essentialist prime—“Scientists reveal that race has no genetic basis.” The latter made subjects less accepting of inequalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flatten hierarchies&lt;/em&gt;: Steep ones sharpen Us/Them differences, as those on top justify their status by denigrating the have-nots, while the latter view the ruling class as low warmth/high competence. For example, the cultural trope that the poor are more carefree, in touch with and able to enjoy life’s simple pleasures while the rich are unhappy, stressed, and burdened with responsibility (think of miserable Scrooge and those happy-go-lucky Cratchits). Likewise with the “they’re poor but loving” myth of framing the poor as high warmth/low competence. In one study of 37 countries, the greater the income inequality, the more the wealthy held such attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From massive barbarity to pinpricks of microaggression, Us versus Them has produced oceans of pain. Yet, I don’t think our goal should be to “cure” us of all Us/Them dichotomizing (separate of it being impossible, unless you have no amygdala).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m fairly solitary—I’ve spent a lot of my life living alone in a tent in Africa, studying another species. Yet some of my most exquisitely happy moments have come from feeling like an Us, feeling accepted, safe, and not alone, feeling part of something large and enveloping, with a sense of being on the right side and doing both well and good. There are even Us/Thems that I—eggheady, meek, and amorphously pacifistic—would kill or die for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we accept that there will always be sides, it’s challenging to always be on the side of angels. Distrust essentialism. Remember that supposed rationality is often just rationalization, playing catch-up with subterranean forces we never suspect. Focus on shared goals. Practice perspective taking. Individuate, individuate, individuate. And recall how often, historically, the truly malignant Thems hid themselves while making third parties the fall guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, give the right-of-way to people driving cars with the “Mean people suck” bumper sticker, and remind everyone that we’re in this together against Lord Voldemort and House Slytherin.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>English rivers polluted by neonicotinoids, first tests reveal</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/13/english-rivers-polluted-by-powerful-insecticides-first-tests-reveal</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/13/english-rivers-polluted-by-powerful-insecticides-first-tests-reveal</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/rivers&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Rivers&lt;/a&gt; in England are contaminated with powerful insecticides, new testing has revealed, increasing concerns over the impact of the toxic chemicals on fish and birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neonicotinoids were banned from use on flowering crops in the European Union in 2013 due to the harm they cause to bees and other vital pollinators. Following even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/29/pesticides-damage-survival-of-bee-colonies-landmark-study-shows&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;more evidence of harm&lt;/a&gt;, an EU vote to extend the ban to all outdoor uses is expected soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, evidence is also growing that neonicotinoids – the world’s most widely used insecticide – harm other species, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/29/common-pesticide-can-make-migrating-birds-lose-their-way-research-shows&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;such as songbirds&lt;/a&gt;. Neonicotinoids have been in use since the early 1990s and now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/05/honey-tests-reveal-global-contamination-by-bee-harming-pesticides&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;contaminate landscapes around the world&lt;/a&gt;. But very little monitoring of their concentration in soils or water is done, a failing recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/21/assumed-safety-of-widespread-pesticide-use-is-false-says-top-government-scientist&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;condemned by a UK government chief scientific adviser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first systematic testing of neonicotinoids in rivers in Britain was mandated by EU water regulations and conducted in 2016. The results, obtained by the conservation charity Buglife, show that half of the 16 rivers tested in England had either chronic or acute levels of contamination. Of the 23 rivers tested across Britain, neonicotinoids were not detected in six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No official limits exist in the EU for neonicotinoid pollution in freshwater. But a &lt;a href=&quot;http://pollinatorstewardship.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Morrissey-et-al-2015_Review-neonicotinoids-surface-water-risk-to-aquatic-invertebrates.pdf&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;peer-reviewed scientific analysis published in 2015&lt;/a&gt; recommended chronic and acute levels that should not be exceeded “to avoid lasting effects on aquatic invertebrate communities”, and these were used by Buglife to asses the new river data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/12/archive-zip/giv-3902BIhsx78a9Jnf&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Neonicotinoids measured in British rivers 2016&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like flying insects, aquatic insects &lt;a draggable=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/etc.2201/full&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;are vulnerable to neonicotinoids&lt;/a&gt; and provide the main source of food for many fish and birds. Recent research in the Netherlands has shown chronic neonicotinoid pollution in water led to &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062374&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;sharp drops in insect numbers&lt;/a&gt; and was linked to &lt;a draggable=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/09/neonicotinoids-farmland-birds&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;heavy falls in bird numbers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are devastated to discover that many British rivers have been heavily damaged by neonicotinoid insecticides,” said Matt Shardlow, CEO of Buglife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Lloyd, CEO of the Angling Trust, said: “These results are highly alarming in the context of widespread declines in aquatic insect life and fish populations. We urge the government to act urgently to ban continued use of these chemicals to protect wildlife, fisheries and drinking water.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most polluted river tested was the river Waveney on the Norfolk/Suffolk Border, where the acute harm level was exceeded for a whole month in the summer of 2016. Sugar beet fields are the most likely source of pollution, said Shardlow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nearby river Wensum, in a Special Area of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/conservation&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Conservation&lt;/a&gt; for its river life, was also chronically polluted. Both rivers supply the Norfolk Broads, an internationally important wetland site and home to many endangered aquatic animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-1 | 1&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed EU ban would still allow neonicotinoids to be used in greenhouses and as a flea treatment for pets. A new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greenpeace.org/eu-unit/en/Publications/2017/study-neonicotinoids-bees-greenhouses/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Greenpeace study&lt;/a&gt; suggests neonicotinoids are frequently found in waterways close to greenhouses where they have been used. The new tests found contamination in a stream in the Cairngorms, which Shardlow said is most likely the result of a treated dog entering the stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is vital that action is taken to completely ban these toxins, including in greenhouses and on pets, before another year of disgraceful pollution occurs,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arlin Rickard, CEO of the Rivers Trust, said: “We work closely with farmers and growers to reduce and better target chemical and fertiliser usage, however some chemicals are just too damaging and persistent to be tolerated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the National Farmers Union said: “British farmers take their environmental responsibilities seriously and have high levels of pesticide stewardship through schemes like the Voluntary Initiative, which offer advice and actions designed to keep pesticides out of water. The Environment Agency closely monitors pesticides in rivers and we are not aware of it raising any specific concerns about high levels of neonicotinoids.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Net Neutrality Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal Was Written by Comcast Attorney</title>
<link>https://theintercept.com/2017/12/14/that-net-neutrality-op-ed-in-the-wall-street-journal-was-written-by-a-comcast-attorney/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://theintercept.com/2017/12/14/that-net-neutrality-op-ed-in-the-wall-street-journal-was-written-by-a-comcast-attorney/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;u&gt;In the face&lt;/u&gt; of widespread opposition, the Federal Communications Commission &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/14/the-fcc-is-expected-to-repeal-its-net-neutrality-rules-today-in-a-sweeping-act-of-deregulation/?utm_term=.b2d55dd5d1ad&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;rolled back net neutrality protections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;that prevented internet service providers from charging websites for faster download speeds. The vote fell along party lines. But one Democrat, Barack Obama’s former Federal Trade Commission chief Jon Leibowitz,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/everybody-calm-down-about-net-neutrality-1513124905&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;dismissed net neutrality repeal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;as no big deal in the pages of the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday. He celebrated that the FTC would get restored authority to aggressively police the internet for anti-competitive or unfair conduct.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The op-ed contained an unusual disclaimer:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mr. Leibowitz was a Democratic commissioner at the FTC from 2004-13 and chairman beginning in 2009. As a partner at the law firm Davis Polk &amp;amp; Wardwell, he represents both technology companies and broadband providers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The reference to both industries reads as an effort to be upfront about any potential conflict of interest, but also to suggest that Leibowitz has clients on both sides of the issue, so his argument is dispassionate. Tech companies, historically, support net neutrality, while broadband providers oppose it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But it’s not entirely clear what “technology companies” Leibowitz himself represents. When asked, he directed The Intercept to the Davis Polk website, which&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davispolk.com/practices/industries/technology&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;lists a fair number of tech companies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for which the corporate law firm has done business.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, we do know Leibowitz’s primary broadband client: Comcast, one of the biggest beneficiaries of the net neutrality repeal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On his&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davispolk.com/professionals/jon-leibowitz/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;bio page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Leibowitz discloses that he has “advised Comcast Corporation in connection with a number of regulatory matters and acquisitions.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davispolk.com/practices/industries/media-and-telecom/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;More broadly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Davis Polk was a key adviser in Comcast’s purchase of NBCUniversal, as well as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-nbcuniversal-buys-dreamworks-20160429-story.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;deals with DreamWorks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-antitrust-comcast/comcast-turns-to-davis-polk-for-time-warner-cable-merger-idUSBREA1D17I20140214&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Time Warner Cable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;(which didn’t end up being approved). Comcast “has used the New York-based law firm repeatedly,” according to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-antitrust-comcast/comcast-turns-to-davis-polk-for-time-warner-cable-merger-idUSBREA1D17I20140214&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reuters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. NBCUniversal’s general counsel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://corporate.comcast.com/news-information/leadership-overview/kimberley-d-harris&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;came from Davis Polk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So a Comcast lawyer used the Wall Street Journal to give an “unbiased” opinion on why the net neutrality repeal represented no threat to consumers. The opinion meshed seamlessly with Comcast’s own&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://corporate.comcast.com/comcast-voices/fcc-to-vote-to-restore-internet-freedom-and-innovation&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;published endorsements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;of the FCC’s action.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Senior Comcast executive David Cohen wrote yesterday, “We have&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://corporate.comcast.com/comcast-voices/comcast-open-internet-commitment&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;repeatedly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://corporate.comcast.com/comcast-voices/comcast-customers-will-enjoy-strong-net-neutrality-protections-today-and-in-the-future&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;stated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and reiterate today, that we do not and will not block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content.” Leibowitz, in the op-ed, stated: “Every major broadband provider has committed not to block, throttle or unfairly discriminate against lawful content.” Comcast, by the way, is actually required not to discriminate, per a consent decree from the NBC merger that expires next year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The order returns authority to the FTC to regulate data privacy and security for the entire Internet ecosystem under a uniform federal technology-neutral framework,” wrote Cohen. Leibowitz wrote, “The plan to restore FTC jurisdiction is good for consumers because it puts the nation’s foremost privacy cop back on the beat.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cohen laments “political grandstanding” and “inaccurate cries of Armageddon” preventing policymakers from coming together “to develop sensible, transparent, and durable Open Internet regulations.” Leibowitz is sad that “the rhetoric over net neutrality has reached a fever pitch,” and if everyone just set partisanship aside, “Congress could cement a meaningful and permanent resolution to an issue that should have been resolved a long time ago.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In other words, there’s essentially no daylight between Obama’s FTC head and a Comcast executive’s viewpoint on net neutrality repeal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The disclosure that Leibowitz works for “technology companies and broadband providers,” seen to be on separate sides of the net neutrality debate, is also unimpressive because many tech giants aren’t so opposed to net neutrality this time around.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-backs-away-from-fight-over-internet-rules-now-that-traffic-is-flowing-1513182751?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Netflix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;has made deals with telecom companies to pay for faster speeds. And Facebook and Google have been&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/12/technology/net-neutrality-fcc-tech.html?partner=rss&amp;amp;emc=rss&amp;amp;_r=0&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;noticeably quiet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;in internet-wide protests this year. So the op-ed disclosure was misleading even without disclosing the actual names of the companies, like Comcast, Leibowitz is involved with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To go a step further, Leibowitz’s view is also wrong. Net neutrality supporters fear that kicking enforcement over to the FTC means that broadband providers would only get caught discriminating against websites after the fact. And the FTC is focusing on stopping “deception,” which critics have said could mean that if a company discloses to the customer it will block or throttle certain content, the agency won’t step in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The FTC also doesn’t have the resources to do its current enforcement, even before adding the internet to its beat. And while a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fcc.gov/document/fccftc-coordinate-online-consumer-protection-efforts&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;joint agreement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;with the FCC to allocate those resources will help, it may not be enough. This is also the agency that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-the-u-s-antitrust-probe-of-google-1426793274&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;defied its own staff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;and let Google off the hook for preferring its own content in search, which happened while a guy named Jon Leibowitz was in charge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the big problem, which Leibowitz only tangentially cited, is that the FTC jurisdiction excludes common carriers, under Section 5 of the FTC Act. Last year a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit appeals court, one of the most liberal in the court system,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.multichannel.com/news/courts/court-throws-out-ftc-throttling-case-against-att/407352&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;threw out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;an FTC case against AT&amp;amp;T for throttling customer data speeds for this reason. Even if AT&amp;amp;T provided non-common carrier services, the 9th Circuit ruled, its other business as a common carrier makes it exempt from the FTC’s jurisdiction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The case is under appeal, and Leibowitz said breezily it’s “likely” the FTC will win. But the makeup of the Supreme Court shouldn’t raise hopes for expanded regulatory authority on anything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reclassifying broadband away from being a common carrier theoretically solves part of this problem. But AT&amp;amp;T’s argument is that it owns a landline common carrier, so it’s exempt from FTC enforcement on all its networks. If the 9th Circuit ruling sticks, it will drive not just AT&amp;amp;T, but all telecom and tech companies, to acquire some kind of common carrier business line to shut out the FTC. Tech firms like Google could merge with a common carrier telecom in a bid to fend off the FTC.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://verizon.yahoo.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yahoo and Verizon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;have already started this possible trend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;More esoterically, companies could charter an “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stlouisfed.org/Publications/Regional-Economist/July-2007/Industrial-Loan-Companies-Come-Out-of-the-Shadows&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;industrial loan company&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,” a type of bank that has a statutory exclusion from FTC enforcement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The point is that you don’t want to put all enforcement responsibility into an agency that might actually not be able to enforce, pending court actions. And Public Knowledge’s Harold Feld argues that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wetmachine.com/tales-of-the-sausage-factory/can-the-ftc-really-handle-net-neutrality-lets-check-against-the-4-most-famous-violations/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;this is, in fact, the case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, even beyond the AT&amp;amp;T common carrier dispute.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is not the first time Leibowitz has gone to bat for his clients. His&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/washington/leibowitz-doubles-down-fcc-privacy-proposal-criticism/157292&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;incessant criticism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;of the FCC’s privacy proposal led to Congress enabling internet service providers to sell personal data to marketing firms. And he signed on to a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/antitrust_law/state_of_antitrust_enforcement.authcheckdam.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;transition report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;on antitrust law that recommended gutting key aspects of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Democrats who are not on the Comcast payroll are expected to challenge the FCC vote. Several Democratic attorneys general have already&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NewsHour/status/941376959644422146&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;planned a lawsuit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Norway switches off FM radio, but a station is defying government order</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;segment-airdate&quot;&gt;Wednesday December 13, 2017&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;124.1257521059&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;segment-middle col3&quot; role=&quot;complementary&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;segment-segments&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;segment-segmenttitle&quot;&gt;more stories from this episode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-wednesday-edition-1.4446492/december-13-2017-episode-transcript-1.4449306#segment1&quot;&gt;Story transcript&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world first, Norway has switched off its FM radio service — but not everyone is celebrating the move to digital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country completed its switch on Wednesday when digital audio broadcasting (DAB) was turned on in some remote regions. Now, listeners will have to use that format to hear national radio broadcasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials say the move to digital will save money. In 2015, &lt;em&gt;As It Happens&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-monday-edition-1.3040660/digital-killed-the-radio-frequency-norway-plans-to-shut-down-fm-1.3041119&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;spoke&lt;/a&gt; with Ole Torvmark, the head of Digital Radio Norway. He was confident people would embrace the switch, and said it would allow for more radio stations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But broadcaster Svein Larsen isn't convinced. Despite government orders, he has continued to broadcast on FM in Oslo. Larsen is the CEO of Radio Metro and the chairman of the Norwegian Local Radio Association. Here's part of his conversation with &lt;em&gt;As It Happens&lt;/em&gt; host Carol Off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why have you continued to broadcast despite the government's orders to stop airing on FM?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think that the government has actually the right to give that sort of order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote-quotation&quot;&gt;'Even if Norway is looked upon as quite a flexible and rational society, it's not easy to take that fight.'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;cite class=&quot;pullquote-source&quot;&gt;- Svein Larsen&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a lot of support from your listeners in Norway?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have great support, and more and more so when it becomes clear that this is actually what the government wants to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't underestimate the fight against the government and different agencies.… Even if Norway is looked upon as quite a flexible and rational society, it's not easy to take that fight. But we have done it, and we will see what will be the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now the public starts to be aware that they actually are closing down not only the national network on FM, but also some of the local stations. But not all of them. Very many are going to continue to broadcast until 2022 — and even after that. But it's my stations in Oslo that they're looking to close down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.4447127.1513204211!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/norway-radio.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;NORWAY-RADIO/&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;Nina Stensrud Martin and Olav Viksmo Slettan turn off the FM-band in favour of digital radio in Tryvannstarnet, near Oslo in September. (NTB Scanpix/Heiko Junge via Reuters)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are they punishing you for not complying?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They want me to pay for every day I'm continuing to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;100,000 Norwegian Kroner (around $15,000 Cdn) per day. I think I have to discuss that with them because they cannot be completely unreasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have both. We continue to have FM and we can get digital channels. It's often a clearer signal [on digital]. We get more variety. It seems to be the way of the future. Why resist it? Why isn't it something that's of benefit to listeners?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. But it's not a benefit to listeners to close down one of the distribution systems. I agree with you. I'm also distributing my radio stations on DAB, locally, here in the bigger Oslo area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote-quotation&quot;&gt;'What sort of logic is that for media companies to operate that way?'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;cite class=&quot;pullquote-source&quot;&gt;- Svein Larsen&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never said that DAB as a distribution technology is not functioning. It's functioning. But the main question is, why do you switch off a system in Norway where we have 10 to 15 million radio receivers? And you just say to the public, you're not going to use this anymore because you need to buy new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What sort of logic is that for media companies to operate that way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, you operate on behalf of the listener. Here, the big players are saying to the listeners: &quot;No. You need to go out and buy new radio receivers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.4447099.1513205254!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/svein-larsen.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Svein Larsen&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;Svein Larsen is also the chairman of the Norwegian local radio association. (Norsk Lokalradioforbund)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In 2015, we spoke with your head of Digital Radio Norway. He was confident that this was going to happen — that people in Norway would buy their digital receivers, they would switch over, and this wouldn't be an issue.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's true. But I know that guy and that was his job. He's paid for saying that. Today, you can ask him the same question and he also admits that it's a big problem that only 50 per cent of the cars have DAB radios, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why they are pushing me also. They feel that if I represent the competition, then that is a problem here in the Oslo area — then that is a problem for other people to change to DAB because they don't feel that they need it. They have my radio stations and they feel happy about that. That's why they're so eager to close me down.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited for length and clarity. To hear more of our interview with Svein Larsen, listen to the audio above. As It Happens has reached out to Ole Torvmark at Digital Radio Norway, but haven't received a response.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

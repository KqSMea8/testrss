<title>Fed Up with Drug Companies, Hospitals Decide to Start Their Own</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/health/drug-prices-hospitals.html</link>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;308&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1343&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-2&quot;&gt;Several major hospital systems, including Ascension, a Catholic system that is the nation’s largest nonprofit hospital group, plan to form a new nonprofit company, that will provide a number of generic drugs to the hospitals. The Department of Veterans Affairs is also expressing interest in participating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;96&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1439&quot;&gt;In all, about 300 hospitals are now included in the group. Other hospitals are expected to join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;178&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1617&quot;&gt;Dr. Harrison said they planned to focus only on certain drugs. “There are individual places where there are problems,” he said. “We are not indicting an entire industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;348&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1965&quot;&gt;Dr. Kevin A. Schulman, a professor of medicine at the Duke University School of Medicine who has studied the generic drug market and is advising the effort, said: “If they all agree to buy enough to sustain this effort, you will have a huge threat to people that are trying to manipulate the generic drug market. They will want to think twice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;454&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2419&quot;&gt;The idea is to directly challenge the host of industry players who have capitalized on certain markets, buying up monopolies of old, off-patent drugs and then sharply raising prices, stoking public outrage and prompting a series of Congressional hearings and federal investigations. The most notorious example is of Martin Shkreli, the former hedge fund manager who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/21/business/a-huge-overnight-increase-in-a-drugs-price-raises-protests.html&quot;&gt;raised the price of a decades-old drug&lt;/a&gt;, Daraprim, to $750 a tablet in 2015, from $13.50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;276&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2695&quot;&gt;Hospitals have also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/29/us/drug-shortages-forcing-hard-decisions-on-rationing-treatments.html&quot;&gt;struggled to deal with shortages&lt;/a&gt; of hundreds of vital drugs over the past decade, ranging from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/business/drug-shortages-are-becoming-persistent-in-us.html&quot;&gt;injectable morphine&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/21/health/sodium-bicarbonate-solution-critical-shortage-hospitals.html&quot;&gt;sodium bicarbonate&lt;/a&gt; (the medical form of baking soda), shortfalls that are exacerbated when only one or two manufacturers make the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;307&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3002&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;“We’re seeing an acceleration of both shortages and escalation of prices,” said Dr. Richard Gilfillan, the chief executive of Trinity Health, a large Catholic system that operates in nearly two dozen states and is part of the group. “There’s not been any effective push back on either of these.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;325&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3327&quot;&gt;Intermountain executives would not discuss many details of the project, citing fears that competitors could shut them out of the market by quickly dropping the price of the drugs in question, then raising them again later. They said they would focus on drugs whose prices have risen sharply or that have been in short supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;181&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3508&quot;&gt;“We’re going to have to hold that very close to our vest,” Dr. Harrison said. The company will either rely on third-party manufacturers or decide to make the drugs themselves.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;143&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3651&quot;&gt;The new company will initially focus on selling to hospitals, but officials said they may eventually expand to offer the products more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;567&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4218&quot;&gt;Dr. Carolyn Clancy, the executive in charge of the Veterans Health Administration, said its pharmacy experts have consulted with the other systems about the project and is now working out the details of its possible involvement. “Our strong interest here is minimizing the impact of any shortages of generic drugs,” she said. While she said the agency is able to negotiate good prices for veterans, “we don’t necessarily control supply” and have experienced many of the same shortages, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/health/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-drug-shortage.html&quot;&gt;recent lack of saline fluids&lt;/a&gt;, as the other health groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;127&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4345&quot;&gt;“We are constantly scanning the horizon and constantly attentive to interruptions of supply chains of medicines,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;581&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4926&quot;&gt;In addition to Daraprim, several old, off-patent drugs have seen sharp price increases over the past several years. In 2015, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International became a Wall Street darling after it sold investors on its business model of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/05/business/valeants-drug-price-strategy-enriches-it-but-infuriates-patients-and-lawmakers.html&quot;&gt;buying up old drugs&lt;/a&gt;, then raising the prices precipitously. That year, it sharply raised the prices of two heart drugs, Nitropress and Isuprel, adding millions to hospitals’ drug bills almost overnight. Valeant’s practices led to a series of investigations and Congressional hearings as well as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/22/business/valeant-ackman-pearson-earnings.html&quot;&gt;shake-up&lt;/a&gt; of the company’s leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;182&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5108&quot;&gt;Representatives for the generic drug industry have noted that many of the most high-profile cases have involved old, off-patent drugs for which there has been no generic competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;300&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5408&quot;&gt;The trade group for generic manufacturers, the Association for Accessible Medicines, said its members generally welcome competition. “The whole generic industry is premised on competition, and that competition brings dramatic savings for patients,” said Allen Goldberg, a spokesman for the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;54&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5462&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;But generic drug makers have also come under scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;424&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5886&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drugchannels.net/2013/11/retail-generic-drug-costs-go-up-up-and.html&quot;&gt;The hike in the price of doxycycline hyclate&lt;/a&gt;, an antibiotic, which increased to $3.65 a pill in 2013 from 5.6 cents in 2012, led to a congressional investigation as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/15/business/generic-drug-price-lawsuit-teva-mylan.html&quot;&gt;state and federal price-fixing inquiries&lt;/a&gt; into some of the industry’s biggest players. Last fall, a coalition of state attorneys general &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-generics/u-s-states-allege-broad-generic-drug-price-fixing-collusion-idUSKBN1D0201&quot;&gt;broadened a lawsuit over price fixing&lt;/a&gt;, accusing 18 companies of engaging in illegal practices involving 15 drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;327&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6213&quot;&gt;Anthony R. Tersigni, the chief executive of Ascension, said he and other hospital executives felt they had little choice but to try to solve the problem themselves. “We took the position collectively rather than waiting and hoping for the generic drug companies to address it,” he said. “We have to address it head on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;249&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6462&quot;&gt;Intermountain executives said that they would seek approval to manufacture the products from the Food and Drug Administration, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm564725.htm&quot;&gt;which has vowed to give priority&lt;/a&gt; to companies that want to make generics in markets for which there is little competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;284&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6746&quot;&gt;The project boasts a high-profile list of advisers, ranging from Bob Kerrey, the former Democratic senator of Nebraska, to Dr. Donald Berwick, a former administrator for the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services, as well as two former executives with Amgen, the drug manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;312&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7058&quot;&gt;Erin Fox, a drug shortage expert at the University of Utah, said the idea of creating a nonprofit drug company is promising. “I think anything that increases the number of suppliers will help,” she said. She added that the trick will be in selecting the right third-party manufacturer to ensure good quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Gulfstream jet from a quiet airport south-east of Raleigh flew captives to be tortured around the world. The government failed to act but local people have refused to let the issue die&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;show-caption&quot; class=&quot;mobile-only u-h reveal-caption__checkbox&quot;/&gt; Johnston County airport terminal, home of the so-called Guantánamo Express rendition flights run by a CIA front company. Photograph: L Siems&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; year after he was released from captivity in Guantánamo, Binyam Mohamed received a letter from Christina Cowger, an agricultural researcher from North Carolina. Enclosed was a petition of apology signed by nearly 800 visitors to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/northcarolina&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; State Fair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was “a small gesture”, Cowger acknowledged, but her 2010 letter came with a commitment. North Carolina Stop Torture Now, an organization she co-founded, had been conducting protests, petition drives and legislative campaigns seeking an official investigation into an obscure firm operating flights out of her local airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm, Aero Contractors, was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/cia&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; front company that operated the Gulfstream business jet that delivered Mohamed to a secret prison in Morocco to be tortured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though few government officials supported such an investigation, she wrote, the group pledged “to work toward true transparency and accountability in the United States for the crimes against you and other survivors”.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven years later, Cowger sat in the front row of a makeshift hearing room in the Raleigh Convention Center as 11 volunteer commissioners of the North Carolina Commission of Inquiry on Torture “upped the ante”, as she put it, on that pledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of two days, this “citizen-led truth seeking commission” called 20 witnesses to testify on the damage done by Aero’s rendition operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;Former Guantánamo detainee Mohamedou Ould Slahi.&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd0bb7bb4472dbdd6b80f491292b769032476592/89_0_827_1034/master/827.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;q=55&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;usm=12&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=ff10e73a51ad10879f6e74dc659f9db7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of those witnesses was Mohamedou Ould Slahi, whose &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/13/guantanamo-diary-mohamedou-ould-slahi-review-global-war-terror-witness&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Guantánamo Diary&lt;/a&gt; opens as he is stripped, made to wear a diaper, and shackled aboard Aero’s Gulfstream in Amman, Jordan, in July 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appearing by Skype from his home country of Mauritania, Slahi faced questions from a panel that included a former chief prosecutor of the international war crimes tribunal, a multi-tour veteran of the Iraq and Afghan wars, a Baptist minister, and a local social worker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How, the commissioners asked, can we advance an accountability process our elected officials have shunned?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a question that North Carolinians have wrestled with before. In 1979, Ku Klux Klan and American Nazi party members opened fire at an anti-Klan rally in Greensboro, leaving five dead. State and federal trials ended in acquittals, and a civil lawsuit raised more questions than it answered about the actions of city officials and police during the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty years after those killings, a community group called for an independent investigation, and in 2006 the citizen-driven Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission released a report on the episode that outlined what it called “the way forward” for the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the North Carolina Commission of Inquiry on Torture aims to find a way forward from one of 21st-century America’s darkest episodes – the global operation to seize, interrogate and torture terrorism suspects that Aero Contractors facilitated from the Johnston County airport, a rustic, single runway airstrip 30 miles south-east of Raleigh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allyson Caison, a local realtor, first heard the CIA was running “a secret little operation” out of the airport around a Boy Scout campfire in 1996. The subject came up again in the early 2000s, when a relative who was a recreational pilot landed at the airport and marveled at its state-of-the-art runway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She didn’t know that the “little operation” a former Air America pilot set up years ago in a nondescript blue hangar tucked into the pines employed more than 120 people, or that the Gulfstream jet she would hear taking off and landing was one of the most prolific spiders in what the Council of Europe has called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jun/07/usa.uk&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;“web spun across the world”&lt;/a&gt; by the CIA’s rendition, detention and interrogation operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;rendition story graphics Aero contractors&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/092dc441c69bdbe18b7c43b0304d874119061e3e/0_0_10800_7200/master/10800.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;q=55&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;usm=12&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=98f0be3f4fcd449523153b3801842936&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2005, the New York Times ran a story titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/31/us/cia-expanding-terror-battle-under-guise-of-charter-flights.html&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;“CIA Expanding Terror Battle Under Guise of Charter Flights”&lt;/a&gt; that lifted the lid on Aero’s rendition flights. Later that year, 40 peace activists from St Louis joined Christina Cowger and other local residents to protest against the company’s role in the CIA’s torture program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group unfurled “Torture Taxi” banners along the airport perimeter. Another was arrested for trespassing near the Aero hangar. Caison, drafted from local volunteers for her realtor’s knowledge of local geography and addresses, helped deliver “citizen’s indictments” to several of her neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It turned out I knew two of the three Aero principals well,” Caison said during a tour around the airport the day before the commission’s hearings convened. “These were prominent, well-respected business people in our community. Their children and mine were schoolmates. I baked their gingerbread houses for Christmas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2001 to 2004 Aero’s Gulfstream, operated under the tail number N379P, and a second, larger Boeing 737 Aero stationed at Kinston regional jetport in nearby Lenoir County, carried out scores of rendition missions. Together, they accounted for roughly 80% of all the CIA renditions during those years, landing more than 800 times in countries throughout Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. The Gulfstream was in and out of Guantánamo so often it earned the nickname the Guantánamo Express.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To drive with Caison around the airport is to get a sense of how much nerve this kind of neighbor-to-neighbor activism takes. In the gleaming new Johnston County airport terminal, the young airport manager greeted her with a wary handshake and a gently drawled apology that he could not attend the commission’s hearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down the road, at the recently fortified automatic gate that blocks the access road to Aero’s hangar, there was no pretense of hospitality. It was lunch hour, and a line of cars was filing out the gate. Each slowed at the sight of Caison’s car. One driver, glaring, almost clipped her side view mirror as he inched past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;Allyson Caison.&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c550c459189404ca93e8489cd51871ab5a6dcee/0_126_3024_3780/master/3024.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;q=55&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;usm=12&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=ebb0d0745e2094c76d1d163293ac7ef0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caison said: “I really think we’ve changed some hearts and minds around here. People are quiet about it because of Aero’s long tentacles. But we’ve been persistent. It’s the strength of our little group. We’ve accomplished a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Carolina Stop Torture Now has had an impact over the last 10 years. Recently released minutes of a closed 2007 meeting of the airport authority in Kinston, where Aero housed its larger 737 rendition jet, confirmed that Aero sold its hangar at the facility that year. When a member of the airport’s board asked its executive director why the company was leaving, the director “explained that Aero Contractors had not had the aircraft in the hangar for several months due to the negative publicity they were getting from Stop Torture Now”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The campaign scored successes at state level and in Washington too. In Raleigh, the group pressed the governor and state attorney general to open a criminal investigation into Aero’s rendition operations. Told that the state had no jurisdiction, the group drew on a growing network of support from churches to press for legislation to make participating in CIA kidnappings, enforced disappearances and torture state crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill twice stalled in committee, but attracted 12 bipartisan co-sponsors and brought the question of rendition for torture before religious congregations throughout the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressure is also credited with helping persuade Senator Richard Burr, then the ranking Republican on the Senate intelligence committee, to join in voting to declassify the executive summary of the Senate’s scathing report on the CIA torture program in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although that report only examined the treatment of prisoners &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/oct/09/cia-torture-black-site-enhanced-interrogation&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;inside the CIA’s black sites&lt;/a&gt; around the world, its release sparked hopes for greater accountability over the rendition to bring suspects to interrogation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burr, now chair of the Senate’s intelligence committee, has made clear there will be no further official reckoning for the agency’s post-9/11 human rights violations, and has sought to recall and destroy all copies of the still-classified Senate report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the volunteer commissioners of the North Carolina Commission of Inquiry on Torture, this is where their responsibility begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With no meaningful accountability from government leaders, it’s been left to citizens to keep this issue alive,” commission co-chair Jennifer Daskal, a law professor at American University, explained in a break in the hearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t have the power to prosecute, but we can offer an accounting of what happened, and of the costs, to prevent this from happening again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I believe in accountability. I’ve done accountability,” said David Crane, who served as the founding chief prosecutor of the international tribunal that prosecuted Liberian president Charles Taylor for war crimes and who lives in North Carolina’s Great Smoky Mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Torture is a clearcut issue: you don’t torture. The American people just need to know the raw facts, and many of those facts are right here in North Carolina.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission invited Aero Contractors to give testimony at the hearings, but received no response. Invitations to the governor, attorney general and several Johnston County officials to attend or send representative to the hearings also went unanswered. Calls to the county manager and county commissioners seeking comment on the hearings and Aero’s operations were not returned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;Christina Cowger&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c84dcb9640d3ec41d46ea3e66d0a7a7c219ad55/0_1358_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;q=55&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;usm=12&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=6175ee98ab8ede7b0d701158d046a864&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The North Carolina Commission of Inquiry on Torturewill collect evidence through the spring, pressing for the release of public records from county and state officials and compiling research and testimony on the lasting harms inflicted by Aero’s rendition flights. It plans to release its final report this summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Allyson Caison and Christina Cowger, that report will add to an official record of CIA renditions that so far has been compiled and officially acknowledged only outside the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the commission’s hearings also sharpened their sense of personal responsibility to repair the harm they see caused by Aero’s operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;As a person of faith, I have to be involved in this,” Caison told the commission near the end of the hearing. “As a mom of two boys, I like to think that if my boys were kidnapped, renditioned and tortured, there would be another mom out there at the other end like me, trying to end an injustice that starts in her neighborhood.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Cowger, the priority now is to address the physical and psychological health of those who survived Aero’s rendition flights – a process that involves “acknowledgement, genuine apology, and some form of redress”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The commission demonstrates by its very being that we are not helpless,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/speaker/michael_meeks/de4d6cd3992f61e1c5f8f33f1a6c4f4b599c8d8f1ce80065bff9c8faa952d565.jpg&quot; width=&quot;128&quot; height=&quot;128&quot; class=&quot;speaker-photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photo of Michael Meeks&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fosdem.org/schedule/speaker/michael_meeks&quot;&gt;Michael Meeks&lt;/a&gt; will give a talk about &lt;a href=&quot;https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/libreoffice/&quot;&gt;Re-structuring a giant, ancient code-base for new platforms. Making LibreOffice work well everywhere.&lt;/a&gt; at FOSDEM 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;label label-info&quot;&gt;Q:&lt;/span&gt; Could you briefly introduce yourself?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With pleasure. I’m Michael Meeks: Christian, Hacker, Husband, and more. I work for Collabora on our ten+ year old mission: to make open source ubiquitous (well that’s the gist anyhow). That means striving to make &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.libreoffice.org/&quot;&gt;LibreOffice&lt;/a&gt; better, helping out others who want to invest in improving it, and supporting / delighting our customers in suitable ways. In recent years, much of that work has been around creating and architecting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collaboraoffice.com/collabora-online/&quot;&gt;Collabora Online&lt;/a&gt; based on LibreOffice. In the past I’ve enjoyed spending big chunks of my time working with other great Free Software hackers from other companies and projects - mostly around GNOME, and openSUSE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;label label-info&quot;&gt;Q:&lt;/span&gt; What will your talk be about, exactly?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primarily about how we’re adapting and moulding this giant code-base with so many opportunities for improvement to new challenges such as how to efficiently use modern threaded hardware to how to build online and mobile versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll also talk about some of the interesting work in Online on scalability, and integrating with lots of other Open Source projects, as well as doing deeper integration with native Linux desktop toolkits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then of course, people want to get involved - so, giving some pointers to help people have fun contributing as well as seeing the latest feature work in LibreOffice 6.0 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;label label-info&quot;&gt;Q:&lt;/span&gt; What do you hope to accomplish by giving this talk? What do you expect?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to encourage people to get involved and work on LibreOffice. We have a huge and growing user-base and still truck-loads of low-hanging fruit to fix in the UI, in file-filters, and the core. I’m also convinced that once people have fought and overcome the LibreOffice codebase they can hack on ~anything. I wrote up some of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.gnome.org/~michael/data/2016-04-29-solving-problems.pdf&quot;&gt;tools and techniques&lt;/a&gt; for doing that to try to encourage new people to skip the distraction rat-race and focus on doing something substantial and deeply valuable alongside us in their spare-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also - many of the key developers on LibreOffice and associated projects will be at FOSDEM, I like them to understand where we’re at so I can get their feedback on what we’re doing and where to go next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;label label-info&quot;&gt;Q:&lt;/span&gt; Ever since the moment LibreOffice forked from OpenOffice.org, a big part of the development resources went into a constant cleanup/refactoring of the code, which is of course not as exciting as developing new features. Has this work ‘under the hood’ paid off? And which parts of the code still need some cleanup?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great questions, I spend some time each year trying to document a subset of the work done here, and yes there is a really substantial cumulative impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the work to translate German comments (now complete) makes the code more accessible and easy to understand, but so does (for example) using new C++ constructs - standard containers, and modern iterators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The improved reference counting work has substantially reduced deep coupling problems across the code and made changing things safer, our big set of clang plugins regularly catches coding mistakes before they get into master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very heavy investment from Red Hat and Google in oss-fuzz as well as coverity-scan has hugely improved our reliability and code quality. Perhaps one of the biggest wins people don’t see was Markus Mohrhard’s work on the crash reporter, which lets us catch and kill the biggest, baddest regressions most quickly where previously we would not be sure which to target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I mention unit tests? The drive to create these and encourage people to implement them may slow down our CI builds, but very substantially increases the quality of the daily builds. Some of the most encouraging contributions I see are from people running those builds and reporting bugs quickly as we develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you look at the cumulative effect of seven years of aggressively paying back a national-debt sized technical debt, we are in an amazingly better place - it makes me cringe mentally to consider working on or even reading the old code; yet still there is plenty more to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of further cleanup there are some obvious pet peeves: we still have a largeish amount of rather un-reliable, hard-to-debug Java integration tests that we are slowly porting to C++ and Python. Our toolkit and rendering code needs significant cleanup work - improving lifecycle, killing manual linked-list implementations, finally removing the separate-alpha implementation we use for all bitmaps to name just a few. Then there is the UX - hackers interested in tweaking and improving the UI wil have plenty to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;label label-info&quot;&gt;Q:&lt;/span&gt; LibreOffice 6.0 is scheduled for release around FOSDEM 2018. What are your favourite new features or improvements in this major release, both visible and under the hood?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow; so - there is really a lot there I can’t possibly do justice to the hard work from everyone; the many improvements to EMF+ rendering are great. EMF+ is used for the previews of lots of embedded objects in documents and is (at root) a pretty raw dump of the GDI+ API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of OOXML interoperability improvements, and an outbreak of new digital signing everywhere: from TSCP signing of paragraphs, to CIB’s work on signature status blocks and GPG integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a chunk of work to extend our threaded XML parsing, and a lot of heavy lifting in Calc to thread the computation engine which is fun. Of course, Online has come on in leaps and bounds: scalability, UI improvements and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s really just a selection - lots more from an awesome team (and with proper credits) in my talk and on-line in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleaseNotes/6.0&quot;&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;label label-info&quot;&gt;Q:&lt;/span&gt; In which areas could LibreOffice use some help? How can interested people contribute?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the easy end - just using the latest nightly builds, reporting regressions and testing new features fast is valuable. Then getting stuck into QA to triage and prioritize incoming bugs is easy. Picking an easy-hack to do, before reading around the code or bugzilla of an issue to fix or feature you want is fun. It is easy to become the world’s expert on a small problem area in the code in just a few days - and send a patch. I’d love to see our built-in Python3 exposed to users and used more interactively in the UI too; there really is a lot to do, checkout our page about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.libreoffice.org/community/get-involved/&quot;&gt;getting involved&lt;/a&gt; for some starting points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;label label-info&quot;&gt;Q:&lt;/span&gt; Have you enjoyed previous FOSDEM editions?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a huge fan of FOSDEM, it is an extraordinary conference: the best annual meeting place for the leading European Free Software developers to meet and freely discuss everything and anything. It is the one un-missable Free Software conference for me - and it seems to get better each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting old friends, making new ones, and talking until rather late in the morning is most enjoyable. It is hard to appreciate the richness and depth of the characters of those we work with via e-mail and IRC. Free Software is built out of real people and one of the best places to meet and appreciate them, as well as discussing the latest ideas is FOSDEM. It’s also a great place for people to learn about the importance of Free Software. I love to see newbies meeting and getting plugged into the teams I care about most. Please come, learn, and find your place to be most effective, as we change the world together. See you there.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;span class=&quot;post-date&quot;&gt;18 Jan 2018&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;embed-responsive-item&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/VcjzHMhBtf0?rel=0&quot; width=&quot;760&quot; height=&quot;570&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s literally taken us years to do it, but Bootstrap 4 has finally arrived! Words cannot begin to describe the elation the entire team and I have for this release, but I’ll do my best. Thank you to everyone, especially to the team, and to everyone who’s contributed code in a pull request or opened an issue. &lt;strong&gt;Thank you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since our last beta, we’ve been hard at work stabilizing a few key pieces of our CSS, polishing our documentation, adding some extra surprises, and planning for our follow-up releases. We still have some kinks to iron out, but nothing’s going to stop us from shipping a stable release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anxious to jump right in? &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com&quot;&gt;Head over to our documentation site&lt;/a&gt; and explore.&lt;/strong&gt; Be sure to check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/&quot;&gt;new Examples&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/migration/&quot;&gt;migration docs page&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to know more before hitting the docs? Great, let’s dive in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-new&quot;&gt;What’s new&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no breaking changes since our last beta, but we have made some key improvements and resolved some tricky bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;6.2555894308943&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Print styles and utility classes have been updated. We’ve improved how printed pages are rendered to ensure pages are reasonably sized instead of rendering them as mobile devices. Print display utilities also include a whole slew of new &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;display&lt;/code&gt; values to match our standard display utilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additive border utilities have been added (e.g., &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.border-top&lt;/code&gt;) and default to a solid 1px light gray border. Now it’s easier to quickly add all borders or a subset of borders to your components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2.7262357414449&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$spacers&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$sizes&lt;/code&gt; Sass maps have been updated to allow more customization the same way our color maps work. You can now add, remove, or replace all your key-value pairs consistently across our CSS. &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/theming/&quot;&gt;Head to our Theming docs&lt;/a&gt; for more information and examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added documentation to our Theming docs for using our provided &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/theming/#css-variables&quot;&gt;CSS variables&lt;/a&gt; for those are living on the edge and don’t want to use Sass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added responsive &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.order-0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.order-last&lt;/code&gt; classes for more control over the flexbox grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, we’ve made plenty of improvements to reusing and extending variables and general code cleanup. But, that’s still not everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-examples&quot;&gt;New examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly every example has been overhauled for our stable v4 release. We’ve removed a couple outdated examples, added brand new ones, and really overhauled a few others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98681/35086849-e8b4dde4-fbe2-11e7-877d-62f82f3e753b.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bootstrap examples&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the rundown of changes to each:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;13.870481927711&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0.91975308641975&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve likely already seen our &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/album/&quot;&gt;Album example&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s been updated for this release to include more content in our photo cards and improved mobile rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/pricing/&quot;&gt;Pricing&lt;/a&gt; is brand new with this release and is a fully custom page built with our utilities and card components. It’s responsive and easily extended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3.7575757575758&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/checkout/&quot;&gt;Checkout&lt;/a&gt; is a brand new, extensive form example featuring all the best parts of our form layouts, validation styles, grid, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0.9527027027027&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/product/&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/a&gt; is also new and is a cheeky riff on Apple-style marketing pages, largely built with only our utility classes. Don’t take it too seriously!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/blog/&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt; has been rewritten from the ground up. Gone is the two column blue header layout. We’ve built a snarky magazine-style layout with featured posts and responsive navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1.6965517241379&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/dashboard/&quot;&gt;Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; has been overhauled as well to feature a live ChartJS example, includes a refreshed sidebar with &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2018/01/18/bootstrap-4/&quot;&gt;Feather icons&lt;/a&gt;, and is semi-responsive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0.93181818181818&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/floating-labels/&quot;&gt;Floating labels&lt;/a&gt; is brand new and builds on our sign-in example to provide a CSS-only implementation of the floating input label. This one’s experimental and may see major changes before we bring it to Bootstrap proper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2.6129032258065&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/offcanvas/&quot;&gt;Offcanvas&lt;/a&gt; has been rewritten from the ground up to show off a navbar-built drawer, horizontal scrolling navigation, and some custom lists built on &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2018/01/18/bootstrap-4/&quot;&gt;media component&lt;/a&gt; and utilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/cover/&quot;&gt;Cover&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/carousel/&quot;&gt;Carousel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/sign-in/&quot;&gt;Sign-in&lt;/a&gt;, and our &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/#framework&quot;&gt;framework examples&lt;/a&gt; only saw minor updates to improve code quality and fix a few smaller bugs. Overall this was a huge update for our examples and I’m excited to iterate on these and add more in future releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;documenting-our-approach&quot;&gt;Documenting our approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New with v4 stable is a brief overview of some of the guiding principles behind why we do the things we do in Bootstrap. Our intent is to distill and document all the things we keep in our heads while writing code, building linters, and debugging. Much of this is focused on concepts and strategies for writing responsive CSS, using simple selectors, and limiting how much JavaScript one needs to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/extend/approach/&quot;&gt;Check out the new Approach page&lt;/a&gt;, and be sure to open an issue or pull request with feedback and suggestions on what else to cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;known-issues&quot;&gt;Known issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No release fixes every bug, and the same can be said for our v4 stable release. Here’s some of the things that we’re looking to tackle first in either a minor release (v4.1) or a patch release (v4.0.1) as time and scope allow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;3.4620886981402&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;4.4796380090498&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/25110&quot;&gt;Input groups, validation, and rounded corners.&lt;/a&gt; I rewrote this for Beta 3 and I thought nailed it, but I was mistaken. We have some rounded corner issues and the only way we can fix them with CSS without breaking backward compatibility is by limiting how extensible the component can be made. We may need a modifier class to avoid some gnarly CSS and satisfy all the key functionality. Check out the issue and cross-linked PR for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2.4375&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table variants, in particular &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.table-active&lt;/code&gt;, have a weird selector we’ve unintentionally left linger since prior releases. The bug results in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/24529&quot;&gt;double application of an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rgba()&lt;/code&gt; background color&lt;/a&gt;—once for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and once for any &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few more issues not yet confirmed or slated for our first patch release, but expect a handful of fixes coming your way before we hit the next minor release. We’ll likely also package up the default branch change for our repository in this next patch release. We didn’t have time to fit in testing a merge of a hugely divergent code base without nuking the entire Git history of v3. Again, more on that soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-releases&quot;&gt;Next releases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of releases, we’re excited about the momentum we have going for us. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/projects&quot;&gt;GitHub project boards&lt;/a&gt; are mostly up to date on upcoming releases, so feel free to jump in and take a look. Our next release will be v4.1 (pending any bugfix patches) and will focus on a slew of small new features, utilities, responsive font sizes, and more. From there we have a couple more minor releases that rally around another group of features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aim to make RTL part of an upcoming minor release depending on overall scope. It’s taken us far too long to commit to this, but we’re on it. Our current plan is focused on implementing this into our build tools and components so you conditionally serve, for example, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bootstrap.min.css&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bootstrap-rtl.min.css&lt;/code&gt;. Weigh in on the open issue please with any feedback; when we’re ready, we’ll tee up a fresh pull request with help from the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth reiterating that each minor release will bring a new hosted version of our documentation. Right now, we have &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/&lt;/code&gt; and come v4.1’s release, we’ll have that plus &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/&lt;/code&gt;. Prior releases will continue to be linked from our navigation as is already the case for v3.x and the last v4 alpha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;themes-update&quot;&gt;Themes update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://themes.getbootstrap.com&quot;&gt;Bootstrap Themes&lt;/a&gt; are getting a major update this year! We’ve been absolutely thrilled with the response since we originally launched Bootstrap Themes and we’re finally ready to share our plans for what’s next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past few months, we’ve been working with some amazing theme creators to bring their awesome work to the Official Bootstrap Themes store. We couldn’t be more excited to announce we’re expanding Bootstrap Themes to include ten brand new themes. We’re currently targeting a first quarter launch with themes all built on Bootstrap 4 (sorry, no v3 for these). Depending on final reviews, we might even get them to y’all in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much of Bootstrap’s reach and usefulness comes directly from designers, developers, and creators all over the world building businesses with and on top of Bootstrap. We want to use our platform to give these creators an even larger audience and provide y’all with the best Bootstrap team-approved themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for more information as we get ready to launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;thank-you&quot;&gt;Thank you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, one last thank you to everyone who’s contributed to Bootstrap 4. It’s been a crazy journey and I’m personally relieved, thrilled, and anxious to call it stable. There have been roughly 6,000 commits to v4 since we first starting working on it back in 2015. We’ve gone every which direction and rewrote far too many things far too many times, but I’m so very happy and fortunate with where we landed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers once again to everyone who’s contributed to and built with Bootstrap. It’s an honor to be building these kind of tools alongside and for all of you.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Scaling Kubernetes to 2,500 Nodes</title>
<link>https://blog.openai.com/scaling-kubernetes-to-2500-nodes/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.openai.com/scaling-kubernetes-to-2500-nodes/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We've been &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/infrastructure-for-deep-learning/&quot;&gt;running&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; for deep learning research for over two years. While our largest-scale workloads manage bare cloud VMs directly, Kubernetes provides a fast iteration cycle, reasonable scalability, and a lack of boilerplate which makes it ideal for most of our experiments. We now operate several Kubernetes clusters (some in the cloud and some on physical hardware), the largest of which we've pushed to over 2,500 nodes. This cluster runs in Azure on a combination of D15v2 and NC24 VMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the path to this scale, many system components caused breakages, including etcd, the Kube masters, Docker image pulls, network, KubeDNS, and even our machines' ARP caches. We felt it’d be helpful to share the specific issues we ran into, and how we solved them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After passing 500 nodes in our cluster, our researchers started reporting regular timeouts from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; command line tool. We tried adding more Kube masters (VMs running &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kube-apiserver/&quot;&gt;kube-apiserver&lt;/a&gt;). This seemed to solve the problem temporarily, but once we passed 10 replicas we knew we were treating symptoms and not the cause (by comparison, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/&quot;&gt;GKE&lt;/a&gt; uses a single 32-core VM for 500 nodes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made us strongly suspect our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/coreos/etcd&quot;&gt;etcd&lt;/a&gt; cluster, which is the central store of state for the Kube masters. Looking in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datadoghq.com/&quot;&gt;Datadog&lt;/a&gt;, we saw write latency spiking to hundreds of milliseconds on the DS15v2 machines running our etcd replicas, despite each machine using a P30 SSD capable of 5,000 IOPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/content/images/2018/01/disk-latency-alt-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;disk-latency-alt-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Those latency spikes are blocking the whole cluster!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benchmarking performance with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/axboe/fio&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;fio&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we saw etcd was only able to use about 10% of the available IOPS because the write latency was 2ms and etcd does sequential I/O, making it latency-bound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then moved the etcd directory for each node to the local temp disk, which is an SSD connected directly to the instance rather than a network-attached one. Switching to the local disk brought write latency to 200us, and etcd became healthy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our cluster ran well until we passed about 1,000 nodes, at which point we once again saw high commit latency from etcd. This time, we noticed the kube-apiservers were reading more than 500MB/s from etcd. We set up &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/coreos/kube-prometheus&quot;&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt; to monitor the apiservers, and also set the &lt;code&gt;--audit-log-path&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;--audit-log-maxbackup&lt;/code&gt; flags to enabled more logging on the apiserver. This surfaced a number of slow queries and excessive calls to the LIST API for Events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The root cause: the default setting for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fluentd.org/&quot;&gt;Fluentd&lt;/a&gt;'s and Datadog's monitoring processes was to query the apiservers from every node in the cluster (for example, this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/issues/3381&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; which is now fixed). We simply changed these processes to be less aggressive with their polling, and load on the apiservers became stable again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/content/images/2018/01/network-traffic--1-.png&quot; alt=&quot;network-traffic--1-&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;etcd egress dropped from 500MB/s+ to almost nothing (negative in the image above represents egress)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another helpful tweak was storing Kubernetes Events in a separate etcd cluster, so that spikes in Event creation wouldn’t affect performance of the main etcd instances. To do this, we just set the &lt;code&gt;--etcd-servers-overrides&lt;/code&gt; flag to something like this: &lt;code&gt;--etcd-servers-overrides=/events#https://0.example.com:2381;https://1.example.com:2381;https://2.example.com:2381&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another post-1,000 nodes failure was to hit etcd's hard storage limit (by default 2GB), which causes it to stop accepting writes. This triggered a cascading failure: all our Kube nodes failed their health checks, and our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/kubernetes-ec2-autoscaler&quot;&gt;autoscaler&lt;/a&gt; decided it thus needed to terminate all the workers. We've increased the max etcd size with the &lt;code&gt;--quota-backend-bytes&lt;/code&gt; flag, and the autoscaler now has a sanity check not to take action if it would terminate more than 50% of the cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We colocate the kube-apiserver, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kube-controller-manager/&quot;&gt;kube-controller-manager&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kube-scheduler/&quot;&gt;kube-scheduler&lt;/a&gt; processes on the same machines. For &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-availability_cluster&quot;&gt;high availability&lt;/a&gt;, we always have at least 2 masters, and set the &lt;code&gt;--apiserver-count&lt;/code&gt; flag to the number of apiservers we’re running (otherwise Prometheus monitoring can get confused between instances).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use Kubernetes mainly as a batch scheduling system and rely on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/kubernetes-ec2-autoscaler&quot;&gt;autoscaler&lt;/a&gt; to dynamically scale up and down our cluster — this lets us significantly reduce costs for idle nodes, while still providing low latency while iterating rapidly. The default kube-scheduler policy is to spread out load evenly among nodes, but we want the opposite so that unused nodes can be terminated and also so that large &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/&quot;&gt;pods&lt;/a&gt; can be scheduled quickly. So we switched to the following policy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;{
&quot;kind&quot; : &quot;Policy&quot;,
&quot;apiVersion&quot; : &quot;v1&quot;,
&quot;predicates&quot; : [
  {&quot;name&quot; : &quot;GeneralPredicates&quot;},
  {&quot;name&quot; : &quot;MatchInterPodAffinity&quot;},
  {&quot;name&quot; : &quot;NoDiskConflict&quot;},
  {&quot;name&quot; : &quot;NoVolumeZoneConflict&quot;},
  {&quot;name&quot; : &quot;PodToleratesNodeTaints&quot;}
  ],
&quot;priorities&quot; : [
  {&quot;name&quot; : &quot;MostRequestedPriority&quot;, &quot;weight&quot; : 1},
  {&quot;name&quot; : &quot;InterPodAffinityPriority&quot;, &quot;weight&quot; : 2}
  ]
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cluster/addons/dns&quot;&gt;KubeDNS&lt;/a&gt; extensively for service discovery, but soon after rolling out the new scheduling policy it started having reliability issues. We found that the failures were only happening on certain pods of KubeDNS. With the new scheduling policy some machines ended up running 10+ copies of KubeDNS, creating hotspots, and we had exceeded the ~200QPS that’s allowed from each Azure VM for external domains lookups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We fixed this by adding an &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity&quot;&gt;anti-affinity rule&lt;/a&gt; to our KubeDNS pods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;affinity:
 podAntiAffinity:
   requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
   - weight: 100
     labelSelector:
       matchExpressions:
       - key: k8s-app
         operator: In
         values:
         - kube-dns
     topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/more-on-dota-2/&quot;&gt;Dota&lt;/a&gt; project started out on Kubernetes, and as it scaled, we noticed that fresh Kubernetes nodes often have pods sitting in &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/debug-pod-replication-controller/#my-pod-stays-pending&quot;&gt;Pending&lt;/a&gt; for a long time. The game image is around 17GB, and would often take 30 minutes to pull on a fresh cluster node, so we understood why the Dota container would be Pending for a while — but this was true for other containers as well. Digging in, we found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kubelet&quot;&gt;kubelet&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;code&gt;--serialize-image-pulls&lt;/code&gt; flag which defaults to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, meaning the Dota image pull blocked all other images. Changing to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; required switching Docker to overlay2 rather than AUFS. To further speed up pulls, we also moved the Docker root to the instance-attached SSD, like we did for the etcd machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after optimizing the pull speed, we saw pods failing to start with a cryptic error message: &lt;code&gt;rpc error: code = 2 desc = net/http: request canceled&lt;/code&gt;. The kubelet and Docker logs also contained messages indicating that the image pull had been canceled, due to a lack of progress. We tracked the root to large images taking too long to pull/extract, or times when we had a long backlog of images to pull. To address this, we set kubelet's &lt;code&gt;--image-pull-progress-deadline&lt;/code&gt; flag to 30 minutes, and set the Docker daemon's &lt;code&gt;max-concurrent-downloads&lt;/code&gt; option to 10. (The second option didn’t speed up extraction of large images, but allowed the queue of images to pull in parallel.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our last Docker pull issue was due to the Google Container Registry. By default, kubelet pulls a special image from &lt;code&gt;gcr.io&lt;/code&gt; (controlled by the &lt;code&gt;--pod-infra-container-image&lt;/code&gt; flag) which is used when starting any new container. If that pull fails for any reason, like exceeding your &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/50568&quot;&gt;quota&lt;/a&gt;, that node won’t be able to launch any containers. Because our nodes go through a NAT to reach &lt;code&gt;gcr.io&lt;/code&gt; rather than having their own public IP, it's quite likely that we’ll hit this per-IP quota limit. To fix this, we simply preloaded that Docker image in the machine image for our Kubernetes workers by using &lt;code&gt;docker image save -o /opt/preloaded_docker_images.tar&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;docker image load -i /opt/preloaded_docker_images.tar&lt;/code&gt;. To improve performance, we do the same for a whitelist of common OpenAI-internal images like the Dota image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As our experiments grow larger, they also become increasingly complex distributed systems which rely heavily on the network for their operation. When we first started running distributed experiments, it became immediately obvious that our networking wasn’t configured well. Directly between machines we got 10-15Gbit/s of throughput, but our Kube pods using Flannel were maxing out at ~2Gbit/s. Machine Zone's &lt;a href=&quot;http://machinezone.github.io/research/networking-solutions-for-kubernetes/&quot;&gt;public benchmarks&lt;/a&gt; show similar numbers, meaning the issue wasn't likely to just be bad config, but instead something inherent to our environment. (By contrast, Flannel does not add this overhead on our physical machines.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To work around this, users can add two different settings to disable Flannel for their pod: &lt;code&gt;hostNetwork: true&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;dnsPolicy: ClusterFirstWithHostNet&lt;/code&gt;. (Though read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/overview/&quot;&gt;warnings&lt;/a&gt; in the Kubernetes documentation before doing this.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;arpcache&quot;&gt;ARP Cache&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite our DNS tuning, we still saw intermittent issues with DNS resolution. One day an engineer reported that &lt;code&gt;nc -v&lt;/code&gt; to their Redis server was taking over 30 seconds to print that the connection was established. We tracked the issue to the kernel’s ARP stack. Initial investigation of the Redis pod's host showed something seriously wrong with the network: communication on any port was hanging for multiple seconds, and no DNS names could be resolved via the local &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnsmasq&quot;&gt;dnsmasq&lt;/a&gt; daemon, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dig_(command)&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dig&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; just printing a cryptic failure message: &lt;code&gt;socket.c:1915: internal_send: 127.0.0.1#53: Invalid argument&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmesg&quot;&gt;dmesg&lt;/a&gt; log was more informative: &lt;code&gt;neighbor table overflow!&lt;/code&gt; which meant that the ARP cache had run out of space. ARP is used for mapping a network address such as an IPv4 address, to a physical address, such as a MAC address. Fortunately, this was easy to fix by setting a few options in &lt;code&gt;/etc/sysctl.conf&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh1 = 80000
net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh2 = 90000
net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh3 = 100000
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's common to tune this setting in HPC clusters, and is particularly relevant in Kubernetes clusters since every pod has its own IP address which consumes space in the ARP cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Kubernetes clusters have been incident-free for about 3 months now, and we're planning to scale to even larger clusters in 2018. We recently upgraded to version 1.8.4, and are excited to see that it now officially supports 5,000.

<og:description>We've been running Kubernetes for deep learning research for over two years. While our largest-scale workloads manage bare cloud VMs directly, Kubernetes provides a fast iteration cycle, reasonable scalability, and a lack of boilerplate which makes it ideal for most of our experiments.

<title>It is not possible to detect and block Chrome headless</title>
<link>https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A few months back, I wrote a popular article called &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/making-chrome-headless-undetectable/&quot;&gt;Making Chrome Headless Undetectable&lt;/a&gt; in response to one called &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14936025&quot;&gt;Detecting Chrome Headless&lt;/a&gt; by Antione Vastel. The one thing that I was really trying to get across in writing that is that blocking site visitors based on browser fingerprinting is an extremely user-hostile practice. There are simply so many variations in browser configurations that you’re inevitably going to end up blocking non-automated access to your website, and–on top of that–you’re really not accomplishing anything in terms of blocking sophisticated web scrapers. To illustrate this, I showed how to bypass all of the suggested “tests” in Antione’s first post and pointed out that they hadn’t been tested in multiple browser versions and would fail for any users with beta or unstable Chrome builds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those beta and unstable versions have since become stable versions, and Antione has released an updated version of his blogpost called &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16175646&quot;&gt;It is possible to detect and block Chrome headless&lt;/a&gt; where he removed the tests that I pointed out as being version dependent and added some new ones. As you might have guessed from the title of &lt;em&gt;this post&lt;/em&gt;, I would tend to disagree with the title of his. To clarify: I don’t think it’s possible to detect browser automation for users who are trying to hide it, and if they &lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt; trying to hide it then it’s trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a &lt;code&gt;window.navigator.webdriver&lt;/code&gt; property defined as part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html#interface&quot;&gt;WebDriver spec&lt;/a&gt; that’s meant to indicate when WebDriver is being used, but it was implemented in Chrome as an indication of &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; browser automation. The summary of the property from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/blink-dev/6GysDZCWwB8/rXbGoRohBgAJ&quot;&gt;Chrome Intent to Ship&lt;/a&gt; is the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add enumerable, non-configurable, readonly property &lt;code&gt;webdriver&lt;/code&gt; to navigator object of a window global object. Property is &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; if CommandLine has either “enable-automation“ or “headless“ switch. Otherwise is &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So basically, &lt;code&gt;const isAutomated = navigator.webdriver;&lt;/code&gt; is your headless test (OK, that’s really testing for &lt;em&gt;automated&lt;/em&gt; rather than headless browsers, but that’s generally what people are actually trying to do anyway). As soon as you go beyond that, you’re basically indicating that you’re trying to detect users who are actively hiding the fact that their browser is automated. That’s when it becomes impossible. You can come up with whatever tests you want, but any dedicated web scraper can easily get around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve read &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/making-chrome-headless-undetectable/&quot;&gt;Making Chrome Headless Undetectable&lt;/a&gt;, then this article should be pretty familiar. I’ll set up a test page that implements each of Antione’s tests, and then show how it’s fairly trivial to bypass each of them. I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seleniumhq.org/&quot;&gt;Selenium&lt;/a&gt; last time, so this time I’ll use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer&quot;&gt;Puppeteer&lt;/a&gt; to spice it up. Most of the test bypasses are implemented as injected JavaScript however, so much of the code should be applicable to any browser automation framework that supports JavaScript injection (see: &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/javascript-injection/&quot;&gt;JavaScript Injection with Selenium, Puppeteer, and Marionette&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I implemented each of the tests that Antione proposes in a simple test page called &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/chrome-headless-test.html&quot;&gt;chrome-headless-test.html&lt;/a&gt;. The page renders a simple table like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/img/headless-initial-results.png&quot; alt=&quot;The initial headless test results.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with the results for each test. The actual tests that are used to populate the table when the page loads are in &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/chrome-headless-test.js&quot;&gt;chrome-headless-test.js&lt;/a&gt;, but I’ll go over the details of each test when I cover bypassing them. The results shown here are what are produced by a headless browser without any attempt at hiding itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, I’ll use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer&quot;&gt;Puppeteer&lt;/a&gt; as my automation framework throughout the article. Puppeteer provides a friendly high-level JavaScript API built on top of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/&quot;&gt;Chrome DevTools Protocol&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s one of my favorite automation frameworks to work with. It can be installed by running &lt;code&gt;yarn install puppeteer&lt;/code&gt; and it will download it’s own Chromium build inside of &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; to use during automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code to visit the test page and record the test results with Puppeteer is quite simple. We basically just launch the browser in headless mode, visit the test page, take a screenshot of the results table, and exit. The code for doing this is available in &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/test-headless-initial.js&quot;&gt;test-headless-initial.js&lt;/a&gt;, and its contents are as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// We'll use Puppeteer is our browser automation framework.
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

// This is where we'll put the code to get around the tests.
const preparePageForTests = async (page) =&amp;gt; {
  // TODO: Not implemented yet.
}

(async () =&amp;gt; {
  // Launch the browser in headless mode and set up a page.
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
    args: ['--no-sandbox'],
    headless: true,
  });
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  // Prepare for the tests (not yet implemented).
  await preparePageForTests(page);

  // Navigate to the page that will perform the tests.
  const testUrl = 'https://intoli.com/blog/' +
    'not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/chrome-headless-test.html';
  await page.goto(testUrl);

  // Save a screenshot of the results.
  await page.screenshot({path: 'headless-test-result.png'});

  // Clean up.
  await browser.close()
})();
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be run with &lt;code&gt;node test-headless-initial.js&lt;/code&gt; and it will produce a &lt;code&gt;headless-test-results.png&lt;/code&gt; file with the results table that we saw earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that there’s a &lt;code&gt;preparePageForTests&lt;/code&gt; method defined at the top of the file that currently does nothing. Throughout the rest of this article, we’ll go through the tests one by one and show how to bypass them. The final result is available in &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/test-headless-final.js&quot;&gt;test-headless-final.js&lt;/a&gt; if you want to take a look at all of the code together at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s just go through and bypass each of these tests one-by-one now. Keep in mind that all of the code developed in each of these sections is intended to go inside of the &lt;code&gt;preparePageForTests&lt;/code&gt; method that is called before visiting the test page. This means that the &lt;code&gt;page&lt;/code&gt; object is available and we’re inside of an &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; function (so we can use &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt;). If you get confused about how any of the parts fit together, just look inside of &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/test-headless-final.js&quot;&gt;test-headless-final.js&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-user-agent-test&quot;&gt;The User-Agent Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// User-Agent Test
if (/HeadlessChrome/.test(navigator.userAgent)) {
  // Test Failed...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the classic test of automated access which has been around since long before headless browsers or even browser automation frameworks (for server-side checks at least). It has a relatively low false postive rate, but it’s also the most trivial thing to spoof or bypass. Command-line tools like &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wget&lt;/code&gt; provide flags to change the &lt;code&gt;User-Agent&lt;/code&gt; header, and Chrome is no different. You can specify the &lt;code&gt;--user-agent&lt;/code&gt; flag when launching Chrome–headless or otherwise–and it will modify both the &lt;code&gt;User-Agent&lt;/code&gt; header and the &lt;code&gt;navigator.userAgent&lt;/code&gt; object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puppeteer also provides a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md#pagesetuseragentuseragent&quot;&gt;setUserAgent()&lt;/a&gt; method that can be used to accomplish the same thing. All it takes is adding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Pass the User-Agent Test.
const userAgent = 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64)' +
  'AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/64.0.3282.39 Safari/537.36';
await page.setUserAgent(userAgent);
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to our &lt;code&gt;preparePageForTests()&lt;/code&gt; method and this test is passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-webdriver-test&quot;&gt;The Webdriver Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Webdriver Test
if (navigator.webdriver) {
  // Test Failed...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting test for a couple of reasons. It’s the only other test that will have a relatively low false positive rate for one thing (although there are accessibility tools which rely on browser automation). Additionally, you see some odd behavior if you attempt to set &lt;code&gt;navigator.webdriver = false&lt;/code&gt; as a way to bypass the test. You don’t get an error during assignment, but &lt;code&gt;navigator.webdriver&lt;/code&gt; will still be &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get around this, we need to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Object.defineProperty()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to redefine the &lt;code&gt;webdriver&lt;/code&gt; property on &lt;code&gt;navigator&lt;/code&gt; using a new getter function. Here’s an example of doing this interactively in the Chrome DevTools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/img/webdriver-fix.png&quot; alt=&quot;Overwriting Webdriver&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relevant bit of code to add to our &lt;code&gt;preparePageForTests()&lt;/code&gt; method is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Pass the Webdriver Test.
await page.evaluateOnNewDocument(() =&amp;gt; {
  Object.defineProperty(navigator, 'webdriver', {
    get: () =&amp;gt; false,
  });
});
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and it brings us one step closer to straight As on our totally-not-headless exam. Notice that we’re using Puppeteer’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md#pageevaluateonnewdocumentpagefunction-args&quot;&gt;evaluateOnNewDocument()&lt;/a&gt; method to ensure that our property is redefined in the page context before any of the page’s JavaScript can running. We’ll be using this same method in all of our other tests as well. You can find more details about it–and similar methods for other browser automation frameworks–in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/javascript-injection/&quot;&gt;JavaScript Injection with Selenium, Puppeteer, and Marionette&lt;/a&gt; article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-chrome-test&quot;&gt;The Chrome Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Chrome Test
if (!window.chrome) {
  // Test Failed...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Chrome &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/msg/headless-dev/nEoeUkoNI0o/9KZ4Os46AQAJ&quot;&gt;doesn’t currently support extensions&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;code&gt;window.chrome&lt;/code&gt; object is undefined in headless mode (NOTE: I was mistaken about the property not being undefined in an earlier version of this article). In a non-headless browser, the &lt;code&gt;window.chrome&lt;/code&gt; object looks something like this (keep in mind that the Web Extensions API is not available in the page context).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;{
  app: {
    isInstalled: false,
  },
  webstore: {
    onInstallStageChanged: {},
    onDownloadProgress: {},
  },
  runtime: {
    PlatformOs: {
      MAC: 'mac',
      WIN: 'win',
      ANDROID: 'android',
      CROS: 'cros',
      LINUX: 'linux',
      OPENBSD: 'openbsd',
    },
    PlatformArch: {
      ARM: 'arm',
      X86_32: 'x86-32',
      X86_64: 'x86-64',
    },
    PlatformNaclArch: {
      ARM: 'arm',
      X86_32: 'x86-32',
      X86_64: 'x86-64',
    },
    RequestUpdateCheckStatus: {
      THROTTLED: 'throttled',
      NO_UPDATE: 'no_update',
      UPDATE_AVAILABLE: 'update_available',
    },
    OnInstalledReason: {
      INSTALL: 'install',
      UPDATE: 'update',
      CHROME_UPDATE: 'chrome_update',
      SHARED_MODULE_UPDATE: 'shared_module_update',
    },
    OnRestartRequiredReason: {
      APP_UPDATE: 'app_update',
      OS_UPDATE: 'os_update',
      PERIODIC: 'periodic',
    },
  },
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this, a more sophisticated test could dig into the structure of the &lt;code&gt;chrome&lt;/code&gt; object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Chrome Test
if (!window.chrome || !window.chrome.runtime) {
  // Test Failed...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is still trivial to bypass. We simply need to mock whatever is being checked for by the test code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Pass the Chrome Test.
await page.evaluateOnNewDocument(() =&amp;gt; {
  // We can mock this in as much depth as we need for the test.
  window.navigator.chrome = {
    runtime: {},
    // etc.
  };
});
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pop that in &lt;code&gt;preparePageForTests()&lt;/code&gt; and you’re good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-permissions-test&quot;&gt;The Permissions Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Permissions Test
(async () =&amp;gt; {
  const permissionStatus = await navigator.permissions.query({ name: 'notifications' });
  if(Notification.permission === 'denied' &amp;amp;&amp;amp; permissionStatus.state === 'prompt') {
    // Test Failed...
  }
})();
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind this test is that &lt;code&gt;Notification.permission&lt;/code&gt; and the results from &lt;code&gt;navigator.permissions.query&lt;/code&gt; report contradictory values. All we need to do to get around this is to make sure that they are consistent. We can do that by overriding the &lt;code&gt;navigator.permissions.query&lt;/code&gt; method with one that behaves how we want it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Pass the Permissions Test.
await page.evaluateOnNewDocument(() =&amp;gt; {
  const originalQuery = window.navigator.permissions.query;
  return window.navigator.permissions.query = (parameters) =&amp;gt; (
    parameters.name === 'notifications' ?
      Promise.resolve({ state: Notification.permission }) :
      originalQuery(parameters)
  );
});
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this will pass through to the original &lt;code&gt;navigator.permissions.query&lt;/code&gt; method if the query name isn’t &lt;code&gt;notifications&lt;/code&gt;, but other queries can be handled similarly if the tests are more sophisticated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-plugins-length-test&quot;&gt;The Plugins Length Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Plugins Length Test
if (navigator.plugins.length === 0) {
  pluginsLengthElement.classList.add('failed');
  // Test Failed...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a particularly user-hostile test because the browser plugins are often concealed as a privacy measure. Firefox does this by default, and there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bcaller/plugin-privacy-chrome&quot;&gt;extensions&lt;/a&gt; that provide the same behavior in Chrome. To spoof the plugins, we can simply define another property getter on &lt;code&gt;navigator&lt;/code&gt; like we did for &lt;code&gt;webdriver&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Pass the Plugins Length Test.
await page.evaluateOnNewDocument(() =&amp;gt; {
  // Overwrite the `plugins` property to use a custom getter.
  Object.defineProperty(navigator, 'plugins', {
    // This just needs to have `length &amp;gt; 0` for the current test,
    // but we could mock the plugins too if necessary.
    get: () =&amp;gt; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
  });
});
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-languages-test&quot;&gt;The Languages Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Languages Test
if (!navigator.languages || navigator.languages.length === 0) {
  // Test Failed...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we get to the languages test. This is another test that vanilla headless Chrome passes without issues for me. Without digging too deeply into this, it likely depends on either the operating system or its configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your configuration doesn’t provide any languages via &lt;code&gt;navigator.languages&lt;/code&gt;, you can again defined a property getter like we did with both &lt;code&gt;plugins&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;webdriver&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Pass the Languages Test.
await page.evaluateOnNewDocument(() =&amp;gt; {
  // Overwrite the `plugins` property to use a custom getter.
  Object.defineProperty(navigator, 'languages', {
    get: () =&amp;gt; ['en-US', 'en'],
  });
});
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the last of the tests, everything should pass at this point. Be sure to check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/test-headless-final.js&quot;&gt;test-headless-final.js&lt;/a&gt; to see how everything fits together or to try running it for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we were able to bypass all of these tests without much difficulty at all. The script that we used to bypass these obviously isn’t going to work in all cases, but the techniques are generally applicable and can be customized for any particular set of tests that a site might employ. If somebody wants to conceal the fact that they’re using a browser automation framework on your site, then they’re going to be able to. Blocking users based on browser fingerprinting is generally a bad idea, and one that mostly ends up hurting users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you found this article because you’re dealing with some browser automation issues of your own, then please do &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/contact/&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;. We have a lot of experience with this sort of thing, and we love working on new projects.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;newstitle&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.winehq.org/news/2018011801&quot;&gt;Wine 3.0 Released&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;newsdate&quot;&gt;January 18, 2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;newsblock&quot; readability=&quot;20.81517747858&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wine team is proud to announce that the stable release Wine 3.0 is now available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release represents a year of development effort and over 6,000 individual changes. It contains a large number of improvements that are listed in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.winehq.org/announce/3.0&quot;&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt;. The main highlights are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Direct3D 10 and 11 support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Direct3D command stream.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Android graphics driver.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved DirectWrite and Direct2D support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, because of the annual release schedule, a number of features that are being worked on have been deferred to the next development cycle. This includes in particular Direct3D 12 and Vulkan support, as well as OpenGL ES support to enable Direct3D on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source is &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.winehq.org/wine/source/3.0/wine-3.0.tar.xz&quot;&gt;available now&lt;/a&gt;. Binary packages are in the process of being built, and will appear soon at their respective &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.winehq.org/download&quot;&gt;download locations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Google, You Creepy Sonofabitch</title>
<link>http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/google-you-creepy-sonofabitch/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/google-you-creepy-sonofabitch/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote a post about &lt;a href=&quot;http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/facebook-you-needy-sonofabitch/&quot;&gt;Facebook being a needy sonofabitch&lt;/a&gt;. They desperately try to get you there, and once they have you they do all they can to keep you there. It’s like a restaurant that bombards your doorstep with flyers until you finally pay it a visit. Once you go there, they lock the doors from the outside and begin force-feeding you from the buffet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ultimately, Facebook is a place you go to. You can decide whether you want to visit the restaurant, or just continue throwing their flyers in the recycling bin alongside the coupon-stuffed weekly circulars and junk mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google is equally needy, but feels a lot more insidious than Facebook.&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike Facebook, Google isn’t just a place you go. It’s built into the infrastructure of your life. It’s your house. It’s the roads and sidewalks you travel on. Google is a lot more infrastructural than Facebook, which is why breaches of trust feel a lot weirder and scarier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s creepy as shit to sit down at a local restaurant and immediately see this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-11212 size-medium&quot; src=&quot;http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180104-134353-700x158.png&quot; alt=&quot;Google notification: Noodlehead reviews and photos&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;158&quot; srcset=&quot;http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180104-134353-700x158.png 700w, http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180104-134353-768x173.png 768w, http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180104-134353-1024x230.png 1024w, http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180104-134353.png 1080w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then as soon as you depart, see this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-11213 size-medium&quot; src=&quot;http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180104-154424-700x155.png&quot; alt=&quot;Google notification: Rate your visit, help others visiting Noodlehead know what to expect.&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;155&quot; srcset=&quot;http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180104-154424-700x155.png 700w, http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180104-154424-768x170.png 768w, http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180104-154424-1024x227.png 1024w, http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180104-154424.png 1080w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a photo, and immediately see this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-11214 size-medium&quot; src=&quot;http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180106-163920-700x160.png&quot; alt=&quot;Google notification: inspire other travels, add your photos to Google Maps.&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; srcset=&quot;http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180106-163920-700x160.png 700w, http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180106-163920-768x176.png 768w, http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180106-163920-1024x234.png 1024w, http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180106-163920.png 1080w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This behavior makes me want to take my phone and throw it in a river. I’m not alone in this. A few friends made earnest efforts to switch over to Android, only to quickly return their devices after being totally creeped out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;9.3360995850622&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;I will say that the last straw was when I walked by a restaurant and a notification popped up that said, “Do they serve spicy food there? Help us out!” and I was like aw hell no google&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Kristina Halvorson (@halvorson) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/halvorson/status/951858404003319808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 12, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;8.2748815165877&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yah. I disabled Google Maps tracking, then Google Search started notifying me about places I was near. I don’t want to play a cat &amp;amp; mouse game with my privacy.&lt;br/&gt;— Dave Rupert (@davatron5000) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davatron5000/status/942833756611674113?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 18, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not a crazy, paranoid, security nerd kind of person. Although I probably should be. I guess I’m just saying that people shouldn’t feel like their every movement is being tracked by the company that makes the phone’s software. Actually, let me rephrase that: I guess I’m just saying that &lt;strong&gt;people shouldn’t have their every movement tracked by the company that makes the phone’s software.&lt;/strong&gt; That seems like a reasonable request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And holy smokes, Google, if you’re going to keep doing this, maybe try not to sound like complete robots:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-11211 size-medium&quot; src=&quot;http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180101-083028-700x154.png&quot; alt=&quot;Google notification: answer quick questions about Feng Japanese Steak House, we need some human help&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;154&quot; srcset=&quot;http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180101-083028-700x154.png 700w, http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180101-083028-768x169.png 768w, http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180101-083028-1024x225.png 1024w, http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180101-083028.png 1080w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Christ. What’s a better way to aleviate people’s concerns about the forthcoming robot takeover than to say “We need some human help” with some stupid emoji in a feeble attempt to soften the blow.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Walkable Streets Are More Economically Productive</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2018/1/16/why-walkable-streets-are-more-economically-productive</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-layout sqs-grid-12 columns-12&quot; data-layout-label=&quot;Post Body&quot; data-type=&quot;item&quot; data-updated-on=&quot;1516116415739&quot; id=&quot;item-5a5e174853450ab8996ddb54&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row sqs-row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col sqs-col-12 span-12&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the value of a street where people can walk safely? Why build streets that are constructed with the needs of people in mind, not just the needs of cars? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block quote-block sqs-block-quote null sqs-col-6 span-6 float float-right&quot; data-block-type=&quot;31&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_4_1516216264089_12775&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;Again and again, when we look at streets oriented toward people we find that they are more economically productive than any other style of development.&lt;span&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&quot; data-block-type=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_4_1516216264089_16183&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people concerned with pedestrian safety and &quot;walkability&quot; care about these issues because they feel that walking is good exercise or that walkable places are more attractive or that walking is better for the environment than driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all valid arguments and may convince some of those reading this article that walkability is important. But what I want to talk about today isn’t an argument based on values or aesthetics. It’s an argument based on pure dollars and cents — one that should convince people with a myriad of values and political leanings that people-oriented places must be a priority if we want our communities to be economically prosperous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again and again, when we look at streets oriented toward people — that is, streets where walking is safe and enjoyable, that people are drawn to visit on foot, and where fast and extensive car traffic is not the #1 priority — we find that they are more economically productive than &lt;em&gt;any other style of development&lt;/em&gt;. This is particularly true when we compare people-oriented places to car-oriented places—think of that stretch of your town that effectively does everything possible to discourage walking and biking, including a street with multiple wide lanes to ensure fast car movement, acres of parking, and minimal (if any) sidewalks, bike lanes and crosswalks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walkable streets, on the other hand, encourage business activity, generate greater tax revenue per acre and offer a higher return on investment than auto-oriented streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;People-oriented Streets Encourage Business Activity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streets where walking is safe and easy are streets where businesses usually thrive. A number of studies have confirmed this over the last several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heartfoundation.org.au/images/uploads/publications/Good-for-business.pdf&quot;&gt;a 2011 report&lt;/a&gt; for Australia’s Heart Foundation, Dr. Rodney Tolley concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Streetscape enhancements add value to an area and are associated with higher rents and the attraction of new businesses. In addition there is good evidence to show that improving walking and cycling environments raises private property values by significant amounts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, in 2009, our friend Joe Cortright conducted &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.walkscore.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/WalkingTheWalk_CEOsforCities.pdf&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; that revealed: “In the typical market, an additional one point increase in Walk Score was associated with between a $500 and $3,000 increase in home values.” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.walkscore.com/&quot;&gt;Walk Score&lt;/a&gt; is an online system that ranks how walk-friendly a particular location is.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfcta.org/sites/default/files/content/Planning/CongestionPricingFeasibilityStudy/PDFs/SF-ModalChoices-SpendingPatterns_RevisedFinal.pdf&quot;&gt;a pivotal report&lt;/a&gt; by Elizabeth Bent and Krute Singha of the San Francisco County Transportation Authority uncovered that “travelers using [transit or walking] spend more per month than those traveling by car.” Interestingly, while the amount that transit users and walkers spent at area businesses &lt;em&gt;on each trip&lt;/em&gt; was less than the average car driver’s spending, the transit users and walkers made more &lt;em&gt;trips&lt;/em&gt; per month, which added up to higher spending overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In truth, you don’t really need a study to tell you these things. Visit the most thriving commercial district in any city — the one full of shops and restaurants and people — and I would bet that it’s an area where walking is prioritized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A walkable street ensures that people can safely cross from a clothing store to a coffee shop and spend money at both. It means that people who live in the neighborhood can grab groceries and other necessities easily, so they’ll probably visit nearby establishments more often. Perhaps most importantly, a walkable street is one in which many businesses occupy the bulk of the land, meaning that dozens of destinations can be accessed in a matter of minutes on foot, and that every inch of land is put to economically productive use — not squandered in empty parking lots or unnecessary landscaping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;People-oriented Streets are more Financially Productive per Acre&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve got data unequivocally showing that people-oriented streets are more economically productive than auto-oriented streets — from big cities to small towns, from the heartland to the South. Our friends at &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://urban-three.com&quot;&gt;Urban3&lt;/a&gt; spend much of their time visiting cities and towns across the nation to analyze their tax productivity, comparing how much tax revenue is produced per acre in different areas. What they’ve consistently found is that compact, walkable places produce far more tax value per acre than auto-oriented places—and that holds true in communities across America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following images created by Urban3 visually illustrate the tax value per acre of every plot of land in four geographically diverse communities and this pattern is evident in all of them. In these maps, a tall plot means a high tax value per acre while a low plot indicates a low tax value. (In the case of the Lafayette map, taller green plots are revenue positive for the city while taller red plots are revenue negative.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&quot; data-block-type=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_5_1516115384092_14938&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In every single image, the people-oriented, historic city centers are the ones that rise far above the surrounding auto-oriented land in terms of tax value per acre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what those city center spikes look like for the average person walking…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&quot; data-block-type=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_5_1516115384092_24082&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do these places all have in common?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Streets are fairly narrow with no more than two lanes of traffic and parking on either side — all of which means cars must drive slowly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sidewalks are present in every image and bump-outs, crosswalks and signals make it easy for people to cross the street.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trees offer shade to people walking (especially important in warmer climates like Louisiana and southern California).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Businesses open right onto the sidewalk, easily accessible to passersby on foot and attracting the attention of people driving slowly as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Residences and offices occupy the second (and in some cases, third, fourth and fifth) floors of these buildings providing additional tax revenue and putting more people within walking distance of the local businesses below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, here’s what the auto-oriented areas on the edge of each town look like…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&quot; data-block-type=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_5_1516115384092_43570&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these images, everything is built around the car:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We see wide roads with multiples lanes of traffic and no on-street parking — all of which induces fast driving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While most of these images do contain a sidewalk (if you look very closely), none of them appear to be inviting places to walk, what with cars whipping by quickly right next to anyone walking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crosswalks are spaced far apart, if there are any at all. Anyone who wanted to cross the street in these images would have to walk a long way to the nearest stoplight and then sprint across several lanes of traffic in order to get to the other side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only greenery to be seen are empty lawns that serve no purpose. No trees shade the sidewalk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Businesses on the edge of town require large signage that can be seen from inside a fast-moving vehicle—not small details that a passerby on foot might appreciate. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every single business has a large parking lot in front of it, rather than more buildings that could house more economically productive businesses. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buildings are only one story tall, which means that destinations are more spread out and tax revenue for each plot of land can only come from one business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern repeats itself in towns and cities across America. When we build for people, we get economically prosperous places. When we build for cars, we get low-value developments. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2017/1/9/the-real-reason-your-city-has-no-money&quot;&gt;The result is that the urban core is almost always financially propping up the entire city&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;People-Oriented Streets Provide a Better Return on Investment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But streets where walking is easy and safe are not just economically significant because of their impact on retail sales or tax values. They are also economically significant because of their incredibly high return on public investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of paving sidewalks for people is minuscule compared with the cost of paving wide roads for cars, installing traffic signals, paying the salaries of traffic cops, etc. Even the cost of providing enhancements to pedestrian space such as trees and benches pale in comparison to what we spend when we build around cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the wear and tear caused by foot traffic is also negligible compared with the wear and tear caused by car and truck traffic, meaning that long-term maintenance costs for walk-friendly areas are also much lower than for auto-oriented places. (Ironically, most cities spend exponentially more on their roads while utterly neglecting their sidewalks.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, a simple sidewalk could serve millions of people traveling on foot for decades, even centuries, with only a small amount of up-front investment and minimal maintenance costs for the city — yet it would support dozens or hundreds of local businesses. The same length of street designed primarily for cars would cost exponentially more to build and keep up and would only serve a handful of businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if that’s not enough to convince you, remember that it's not just walking infrastructure that's more affordable to build and maintain in and of itself. The businesses and homes that exist in walkable areas &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; provide a better return on investment than the buildings in auto-oriented areas. The two streets below— one people-oriented and one auto-oriented — illustrate this clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&quot; data-block-type=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_19_1516216264089_39341&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first photo, we see that &lt;em&gt;just one side&lt;/em&gt; of this walkable block is occupied by more than a dozen businesses, most of which have apartments or offices above them.  Most of the buildings are 100+ years old and have been home to countless businesses and residences since they were constructed. Those initial investments we made a century ago are paying amazing dividends today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second photo, we see a similar length of auto-oriented street whose buildings were constructed much more recently and will likely only ever serve on purpose: to house a Perkins restaurant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The businesses in the first photo get to use all of their space for actually conducting business — serving food, selling products, and so on. Meanwhile, the lone Perkins in the second photo has to reserve most of its space for a parking lot and a large sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invest in an auto-oriented street and you are temporarily filling a space that will likely be empty in a decade, draining life and tax value from your town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invest in a people-oriented street and you have created value that will continue to benefit your town for decades and even centuries to come.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Is WebAssembly the Return of Java Applets and Flash?</title>
<link>https://words.steveklabnik.com/is-webassembly-the-return-of-java-applets-flash</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://words.steveklabnik.com/is-webassembly-the-return-of-java-applets-flash</guid>
<description>&lt;time datetime=&quot;2018-07-25&quot; class=&quot;article_time&quot;&gt;July 25, 2018&lt;/time&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&quot;http://words.steveklabnik.com/webassembly-is-more-than-just-the-web&quot;&gt;last post on WebAssembly&lt;/a&gt;, I made the following claim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;large&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some have compared WebAssembly to Java applets; in some ways, they’re very right, but in some ways, they’re very wrong. Eventually I’ll write a post about the wrong, but for now, the right: in some sense, WebAssembly is a different way of accomplishing what the JVM set out to do: it’s a common virtual machine that can be used to build very cross-platform software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people expressed interest in me elaborating, so let’s get to it! For this post, I’m going to make three comparisons: to Flash, to Java Applets, and &lt;em&gt;occasionally&lt;/em&gt; to PNaCL. Secondly, this post is going to focus on the &lt;em&gt;web&lt;/em&gt; use-case for WebAssembly, even though the previous post was about non-web uses. We’ll make &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; comparison in the next post. Finally, this post is kind of like eating tapas, there’s a bunch of little sections. I feel like it’s a bit short, but at the same time, I’m trying to get back into the habit of blogging, and if I try to keep expanding it, it’ll take forever, so it is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;For what it’s worth, I think this comparison is very &lt;em&gt;natural&lt;/em&gt;; that is, when you hear this pitch for WebAssembly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;large&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable target for compilation of high-level languages like C/C++/Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds quite a bit like previous technologies. Asking how they relate, or assuming that they’re a slightly different take on the problem makes a lot of sense. But WebAssembly is significantly different, for a few reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;wasm-won_2&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;head_anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://words.steveklabnik.com/is-webassembly-the-return-of-java-applets-flash#wasm-won_2&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;Wasm won&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first reason that WebAssembly is different is that it’s succeeded, and those technologies did not. When I say this, I mean it in a very specific way; if you look at the number of Flash applications out there, and compare it to the number of WebAssembly apps out there, Wasm loses, for sure. Those of us that are excited about WebAssembly still have a lot of work to do before it’s widely used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I say “WebAssembly won”, I mean that it’s become a part of the Web Platform. Flash, Java Applets, and PNaCL used the browser’s plugin functionality to work. They were, in a sense, &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; of the web ecosystem. They were never standardized, and that matters a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some sense, this is the final point, really. But just saying that it’s true doesn’t explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;. The rest of this post digs into &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; this occurred, and those points sort of sum up to this one: other technologies didn’t make it, but WebAssembly did. There’s a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of overlap here, but I’m trying to reasonably separate it out into individual points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-technologies-didn39t-fit-nicely-into-th_2&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;head_anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://words.steveklabnik.com/is-webassembly-the-return-of-java-applets-flash#other-technologies-didn39t-fit-nicely-into-th_2&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;Other technologies didn’t fit nicely into the platform&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://svbtleusercontent.com/gY9tj6D62jnC9Fc6RncFhD0xspap.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://svbtleusercontent.com/gY9tj6D62jnC9Fc6RncFhD0xspap_small.gif&quot; alt=&quot;flashloading.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://svbtleusercontent.com/qaipxL2e5a4gLH5cAhRHDn0xspap.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://svbtleusercontent.com/qaipxL2e5a4gLH5cAhRHDn0xspap_small.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;javacup.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://svbtleusercontent.com/9mGgBDzvwYYLGHFg4Pafzt0xspap.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://svbtleusercontent.com/9mGgBDzvwYYLGHFg4Pafzt0xspap_small.png&quot; alt=&quot;pluginnotsupported.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you built an applet in one of these technologies, you didn’t really build a &lt;em&gt;web application&lt;/em&gt;. You had a web page with a chunk cut out of it, and your applet worked within that frame. You lost all of the benefits of other web technologies; you lost HTML, you lost CSS, you lost the accessibility built into the web. These platforms never gained the ability to interact with the rest of the platform provided by your browser. Well, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/applet/manipulatingDOMFromApplet.html&quot;&gt;technically they might have&lt;/a&gt;, but that’s not how these technologies were used in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could the web sustain an ecosystem that doesn’t integrate with it? It was never going to happen. And users ended up solidly rejecting it. Outside of games, users &lt;em&gt;hated&lt;/em&gt; Flash. Java Applets were heavy and slow. Enshrining these technologies into the web platform wasn’t going to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly, on the other hand, is much closer to JavaScript. It doesn’t inherently require taking over a part of your screen. It doesn’t expect to be its own little closed off world. Via JavaScript today, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WebAssembly/host-bindings/blob/master/proposals/host-bindings/Overview.md&quot;&gt;on its own in the future&lt;/a&gt;, it’s able to interact with the surrounding environment. It just… fits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-technologies-were-owned-by-companies_2&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;head_anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://words.steveklabnik.com/is-webassembly-the-return-of-java-applets-flash#other-technologies-were-owned-by-companies_2&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;Other technologies were owned by companies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java was owned by Sun Microsystems, Flash was owned by Adobe. But why does this matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate influence on the web is a complicated topic. But &lt;em&gt;in general&lt;/em&gt;, the web runs on a psuedo-consensus model. Java and Flash, on the other hand, were controlled by their respective companies. These companies have significant motive to make profit, not to make the web better. And that’s partially what led to the above situation; these companies didn’t care that they didn’t integrate properly with the rest of the platform. Why would they? It’d be much better for business if you got locked into their platform, and abandoned the rest of the web entirely. The incentives are fundamentally misaligned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly is a joint venture between Mozilla, Google, Apple, Microsoft, and others. It’s not trying to push anyone’s particular platform, but instead represents the shared interests of a wide number of stakeholders, both corporate and individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;webassembly-followed-the-web-process_2&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;head_anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://words.steveklabnik.com/is-webassembly-the-return-of-java-applets-flash#webassembly-followed-the-web-process_2&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;WebAssembly followed the web process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; meant that these technologies never really followed the process that we use to standardize the web. That being said, the web standards process is healthier than its ever been, and at the time these technologies were big, things worked a bit differently. Regardless, WebAssembly followed the way that we do things on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;code class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;asm.js&lt;/code&gt; was created, proving that we could do more impressive things with the web. Its performance was good enough to demonstrate what could be done, though it wasn’t fantastic. The secret sauce of &lt;code class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;asm.js&lt;/code&gt; was that it was just JavaScript; it was fully backwards compatible with the existing ecosystem. “Don’t break the web” is a very, very important rule for browser vendors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly was sort of &lt;code class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;asm.js&lt;/code&gt; done better. After building some degree of consensus around &lt;code class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;asm.js&lt;/code&gt;, a variety of people came together to make WebAssembly a reality. Given that it wasn’t just JavaScript, it had to go through the usual process for browsers to implement it, and it did so. Now a W3C spec, it went &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; the grain of web standards, not against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;corollary-other-technologies-were-too-big-and_3&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;head_anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://words.steveklabnik.com/is-webassembly-the-return-of-java-applets-flash#corollary-other-technologies-were-too-big-and_3&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;Corollary: other technologies were too big and unstable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s another reason Wasm succeeded: it’s tiny. Wasm takes the approach of other web technologies: start small, and build on those foundations. Stay backwards compatible. These technologies also didn’t follow that particular social convention. For Flash and Java Applets, you’d be downloading the particular runtime you needed, and so there was no need for compatibility. PNaCl built on top of LLVM IR, which is completely unstable. They were going to make it a stable subset, but then when LLVM introduces changes, it would have ended up diverging, which isn’t a great situation to be in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These technologies were also far too large to ever make it through the stabilization process. Can you imagine the big four browser vendors specifying the JVM in full and then agreeing to those semantics for all time? For all of ActionScript, itself a similar-to-but-not-quite version of ECMAScript? For all of LLVM-IR?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large technologies introduce an unacceptable amount of risk in this situation. It’s an all-or-nothing kind of deal, and the safe bet is to go with “nothing.” WebAssembly, on the other hand, does almost nothing. It’s pretty much math and calling into JavaScript. This means it’s &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; easier to develop consensus around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;collary-other-technologies-required-an-entire_3&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;head_anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://words.steveklabnik.com/is-webassembly-the-return-of-java-applets-flash#collary-other-technologies-required-an-entire_3&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;Collary: other technologies required an entire separate virtual machine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t mentioned Dart in this post, but it sort of fits here too. One big issue with “let’s just put the JVM in every browser” is that browsers &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; contain a language runtime: JavaScript’s. It’s hard enough to maintain one runtime, let alone two. And then how do you integrate them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly, on the other hand, was designed to be a small extension to existing JavaScript virtual machines. While you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; implement your own WebAssembly VM, and non-web use cases often do, for browsers, the maintenance cost is much, much lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-technologies-were-too-specific_2&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;head_anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://words.steveklabnik.com/is-webassembly-the-return-of-java-applets-flash#other-technologies-were-too-specific_2&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;Other technologies were too specific&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly is fundamentally langauge-agnostic. Flash and Java Applets were built first and foremost to run ActionScript and Java. They’re deeply tied to their relative semantics. Even PNaCl suffers from this to some degree; LLVM is really designed for C-like languages, though not quite the same amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we really want to christen one language as the next language of the web? We already have JavaScript. Are we someday going to introduce a third language? A fourth? An agnostic approach is significantly better for longevity’s sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;wasm-has-a-strong-approach-for-safety_2&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;head_anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://words.steveklabnik.com/is-webassembly-the-return-of-java-applets-flash#wasm-has-a-strong-approach-for-safety_2&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;Wasm has a strong approach for safety&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java Applets and Flash were security &lt;em&gt;nightmares&lt;/em&gt;. Even if there were attempts to secure them, in reality, they constantly had problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly, on the other hand, piggybacks on that JavaScript VM again; all of the effort going into creating its sandbox also applies to Wasm. Wasm is missing some features of regular assembly language that can cause security vulnerabilities, like stack smashing. Wasm is memory-safe, which is huge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, WebAssembly was designed for &lt;em&gt;validation&lt;/em&gt; in mind; its fully typed, and can be checked without running any of its code. It spec includes instructions on how to do validation. This stuff is quite useful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion_2&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;head_anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://words.steveklabnik.com/is-webassembly-the-return-of-java-applets-flash#conclusion_2&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I’ll say about this post is that it’s quite &lt;em&gt;implementer&lt;/em&gt; focused. But implementers are important; they control the web. Providing a solution that works with their goals is just as important as something that works for users. In a future post, I’d like to try to go over user concerns some as well. I have lots of posts to write!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other technologies were not integrated into the platform, and commercial interests didn’t point towards that happening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other technologies required too much; too much to agree on, too much to implement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wasm has a really strong sandboxing and verification story that others simply did not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;712&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kudos&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;712&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook stock drops more than 20% after revenue forecast misses</title>
<link>https://www.marketwatch.com/story/facebook-stock-crushed-after-revenue-user-growth-miss-2018-07-25</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.marketwatch.com/story/facebook-stock-crushed-after-revenue-user-growth-miss-2018-07-25</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. is evidently not bulletproof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The social-media behemoth’s stock lost roughly one-fifth of its value in the extended session Wednesday after its earnings report missed expectations on revenue and showed slowing user growth. Weak guidance also rattled investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook &lt;span class=&quot;quote down bgQuote&quot; data-channel=&quot;/quotes/zigman/9962609/composite&quot; data-bgformat=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;qt-chip trackable&quot; data-fancyid=&quot;XNASStockFB&quot; href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fb&quot; data-track-mod=&quot;MW_story_quote&quot;&gt;FB, &lt;span class=&quot;bgPercentChange&quot;&gt;-17.86%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  stock dropped about 7% immediately after the earnings report was released, then plummeted to a loss of more than 20% as a conference call with analysts progressed. Close to 34 million shares changed hands in the extended session, well above the average volume of 17 million shares for a regular trading session over the past month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should the losses hold into Thursday’s regular session, Facebook would lose more than $100 billion in market capitalization and lose the stock’s gains for the year thus far. As the after-hours session wrapped up, Facebook was trading at $173.50, down 20%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook stock had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/facebook-stock-hits-record-high-ahead-of-earnings-2018-07-25&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;recovered from a decline earlier this year in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal&lt;/a&gt;, one of several controversies and warning signs that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/facebook-earnings-amid-controversy-finances-appear-bulletproof-2018-07-23&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;the company had managed to weather with little damage to its stock&lt;/a&gt;. But declining revenue and user growth, topped by a warning from executives that it will continue, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/zuckerberg-deletefacebook-has-not-had-effect-but-it-will-take-years-to-fix-facebook-2018-04-04&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;seemed to end that run&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The guidance, it’s nightmare guidance,” GBH Insights head of technology research Daniel Ives said. “If you look at their forecast for the second half of the year in terms of user growth, and the expense profile, it refuels the fundamental worries about Facebook post-Cambridge Analytica.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article-image-wrap shareable&quot; data-share-text=&quot;Facebook stock drops more than 20% after warning that revenue growth will take a hit&quot; data-share-modprefix=&quot;mw_image_&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;article-image NS&quot; src=&quot;https://ei.marketwatch.com/Multimedia/2018/07/25/Photos/NS/MW-GN150_facebo_20180725184902_NS.jpg?uuid=ecfefa74-905c-11e8-917b-ac162d7bc1f7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/zuckerberg-deletefacebook-has-not-had-effect-but-it-will-take-years-to-fix-facebook-2018-04-04&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;Don’t miss: #DeleteFacebook has not had effect, but it will take years to fix Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Menlo Park, Calif.-based company reported $5.12 billion in net income for the quarter, which amounts to $1.74 a share, up from $3.89 billion or $1.32 a share in the year-ago period. The bottom-line beat was above analysts’ average estimates of $1.71 a share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profits were not what rattled investors, though. Facebook recorded sales of $13.04 billion, a 41.9% increase from a year ago, but that was lower than analyst estimates and previous growth rates. User growth was flat in the U.S. and Canada, and declined in Europe from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/zuckerberg-deletefacebook-has-not-had-effect-but-it-will-take-years-to-fix-facebook-2018-04-04&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;previous quarter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the stock didn’t fall off a cliff until Chief Financial Officer David Wehner disclosed that the social-media giant expects the revenue-growth slowdown to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our total revenue-growth rates will continue to decelerate in the second half of 2018, and we expect our revenue-growth rates to decline by high-single-digit percentages from prior quarters sequentially in both Q3 and Q4,” he said on the conference call. Wehner also said Facebook still expects expenses to grow 50% to 60% from last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has said the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/zuckerberg-deletefacebook-has-not-had-effect-but-it-will-take-years-to-fix-facebook-2018-04-04&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;planned to hire 20,000 people to handle safety&lt;/a&gt; and security on its platforms in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/facebook-earnings-beat-estimates-amid-data-privacy-concerns-2018-04-25&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;response to controversies such as use of Facebook to push fake news&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the 2016 U.S. election. The company disclosed that its head count has increased 47% to 30,275 since the year-earlier period, part of that outsize spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As I’ve said on past calls, we’re investing so much in security that it will significantly impact our profitability,” Zuckerberg said. “We’re starting to see that this quarter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though Ives says that the quarter was far from disastrous — it was decent with a few rough patches — he expects investors to continue punishing the stock in the near-term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The quarter itself had geographic soft spots and disappointed the bulls,” Ives said. “There are a lot of natural headwinds [Facebook is] seeing, this is going to be one quarter that puts the stock in the penalty box for a while until they can prove that advertising tailwinds and user growth are back on the right track.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s numbers in Europe declined in large part due to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-things-to-know-about-europes-new-data-rules-which-could-cost-big-bad-tech-billions-2018-03-21&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation&lt;/a&gt;, which went into effect during the quarter. Some analysts had speculated that GDPR might actually benefit giants such as Facebook and Alphabet because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/facebook-to-profit-from-gdpr-says-analyst-2018-06-01&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;they would be able to implement the new requirements unlike smaller companies&lt;/a&gt;, but Zuckerberg and other executives said GDPR was the reason for Europe’s slowing user count. It dropped by 3 million daily users and 1 million monthly users since the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We did see a decline in monthly actives in Europe, down by about 1 million people as a result, and at the same time, it was encouraging to see the vast majority of people affirm that though want us to use context, including from websites this they visit, to make our ads more relevant and improve their overall product experience,” Zuckerberg said on the earnings call with analysts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said on the call that the GDPR has not affected the company’s top line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-things-to-know-about-europes-new-data-rules-which-could-cost-big-bad-tech-billions-2018-03-21&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;See: 5 things to know about the GDPR rules taking effect Friday — which could cost big, bad tech billions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one saving grace for Facebook could be continued support from advertisers. Less subject to the quarterly demands of investors, advertisers aren’t yet seen as planning to ease back on Facebook budgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s still unprecedented scale, the best ad tech in the industry,” said PMX Agency Facebook lead Jesse Math. “In the short term, Facebook is still viable. Really this quarter and this year it’s focused on a long-term strategy, everything they do is focused on making Facebook a place where users want to be. All the changes it’s been making to the platform, the algorithms, the tools advertisers use are for the long term.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Facebook stock plummeted after hours, it also brought social-media rivals Twitter Inc. &lt;span class=&quot;quote down bgQuote&quot; data-channel=&quot;/quotes/zigman/23556538/composite&quot; data-bgformat=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;qt-chip trackable&quot; data-fancyid=&quot;XNYSStockTWTR&quot; href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/twtr&quot; data-track-mod=&quot;MW_story_quote&quot;&gt;TWTR, &lt;span class=&quot;bgPercentChange&quot;&gt;-3.23%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  and Snapchat parent company Snap Inc. &lt;span class=&quot;quote down bgQuote&quot; data-channel=&quot;/quotes/zigman/86364478/composite&quot; data-bgformat=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;qt-chip trackable&quot; data-fancyid=&quot;XNYSStockSNAP&quot; href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/snap&quot; data-track-mod=&quot;MW_story_quote&quot;&gt;SNAP, &lt;span class=&quot;bgPercentChange&quot;&gt;-1.72%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  to the party, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/twitter-and-snap-fall-along-with-facebook-2018-07-25&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;sending both stocks down by single-digit&lt;/a&gt; percentages.

<title>AMD stock rises after best earnings in 7 years</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Advanced Micro Devices Inc. shares rose in the extended session Wednesday after the chip maker’s quarterly results topped Wall Street estimates on strong revenue gains and its best earnings in seven years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD &lt;span class=&quot;quote up bgQuote&quot; data-channel=&quot;/quotes/zigman/44030976/composite&quot; data-bgformat=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;qt-chip trackable&quot; data-fancyid=&quot;XNASStockAMD&quot; href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amd&quot; data-track-mod=&quot;MW_story_quote&quot;&gt;AMD, &lt;span class=&quot;bgPercentChange&quot;&gt;+14.21%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  shares advanced 4.9% after hours, after closing down 0.9% at $16.05 in the regular session. In comparison, the S&amp;amp;P 500 index &lt;span class=&quot;quote down bgQuote&quot; data-channel=&quot;/quotes/zigman/3870025/realtime&quot; data-bgformat=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;qt-chip trackable&quot; data-fancyid=&quot;IndexSPX&quot; href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx&quot; data-track-mod=&quot;MW_story_quote&quot;&gt;SPX, &lt;span class=&quot;bgPercentChange&quot;&gt;-0.12%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  gained 0.9% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index &lt;span class=&quot;quote down bgQuote&quot; data-channel=&quot;/quotes/zigman/12633936/realtime&quot; data-bgformat=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;qt-chip trackable&quot; data-fancyid=&quot;XNASIndexCOMP&quot; href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/comp&quot; data-track-mod=&quot;MW_story_quote&quot;&gt;COMP, &lt;span class=&quot;bgPercentChange&quot;&gt;-0.73%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  rose 1.2% in Wednesday’s regular session. AMD shares closed up 56% for the year on Wednesday, while the S&amp;amp;P 500 is up 6.5% and the Nasdaq has gained nearly 15%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We had an outstanding second quarter with strong revenue growth, margin expansion and our highest quarterly net income in seven years,” President and Chief Executive Lisa Su said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One area of quick growth has been with the company’s Epyc data-center graphics processing unit (GPU), which has been out for a year. On a conference call, Su said there was no question that data-center sales of Epyc were growing very quickly even though the size of the business now is still small. The CEO said AMD plans to re-invest “heavily” in the business to grow it out over the next four to eight quarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s no question that the demand for GPUs in the data center is growing quickly,” Su said on the call. “Our focus on the GPU side is very cloud centric.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, AMD’s Epyc chip was adopted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amds-stock-surges-to-9-month-high-after-analyst-price-hike-cisco-adoption-2018-06-01&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;Cisco Systems Inc.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;quote up bgQuote&quot; data-channel=&quot;/quotes/zigman/20039/composite&quot; data-bgformat=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;qt-chip trackable&quot; data-fancyid=&quot;XNASStockCSCO&quot; href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/csco&quot; data-track-mod=&quot;MW_story_quote&quot;&gt;CSCO, &lt;span class=&quot;bgPercentChange&quot;&gt;+1.23%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amd-stock-gains-after-company-says-epyc-processor-will-power-new-hpe-server-2018-06-06&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;quote up bgQuote&quot; data-channel=&quot;/quotes/zigman/59456673/composite&quot; data-bgformat=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;qt-chip trackable&quot; data-fancyid=&quot;XNYSStockHPE&quot; href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/hpe&quot; data-track-mod=&quot;MW_story_quote&quot;&gt;HPE, &lt;span class=&quot;bgPercentChange&quot;&gt;+1.71%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  for their makes of servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Santa Clara, Calif.-based chip maker reported second-quarter net income of $116 million, or 11 cents a share, compared with a loss of $42 million, or 4 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings were 14 cents a share. Of the 26 analysts surveyed by FactSet, AMD on average was expected to post adjusted earnings of 12 cents a share, while Estimize, a software platform that uses crowdsourcing from hedge-fund executives, brokerages, buy-side analysts and others, called for earnings of 14 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue rose to $1.76 billion from $1.15 billion in the year-ago period. Wall Street expected revenue of $1.72 billion, according to 25 analysts polled by FactSet. AMD had predicted revenue of $1.68 billion to $1.78 billion. Estimize expected revenue of $1.76 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of computing and graphics chips surged 64% from a year ago to $1.09 billion, driven by strong sales of Radeon and Ryzen chips, AMD said. Analysts had expected computing and graphics revenue of $1.06 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of enterprise, embedded and semi-custom chips segment revenue rose 37% from a year ago to $670 million. Analysts had forecast enterprise, embedded and semi-custom sales of $661 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-will-chip-makers-say-about-the-trade-war-2018-07-17&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;What will chip makers say about the trade war?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third quarter, AMD said it estimates revenue of $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion, “driven by the sales growth of Ryzen and Epyc products, partially offset by lower sales of GPU products in the blockchain market.” Analysts had forecast revenue of $1.76 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While AMD shares jumped in after-hours activity, relatively speaking they were less volatile than usual. In the previous 12 quarters, pricing in AMD shares have swung by double-digit percentages six times in the day following earnings, with the direction not always corresponding to whether results beat Street estimates or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 33 analysts who cover AMD, 13 have buy or overweight ratings, 14 have hold ratings and six have sell or underweight ratings, with an average price target of $14.88.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Elixir v1.7 released</title>
<link>https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2018/07/25/elixir-v1-7-0-released/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2018/07/25/elixir-v1-7-0-released/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A new semester has started, which means it is time for a new Elixir release! This release brings quality of life improvements to the documentation, to error handling, to logger reporting, and to ExUnit, Elixir’s testing library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also glad to welcome Michał Muskała to the Elixir Core team. Prior to joining the team, he was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/elixir-ecto/ecto&quot;&gt;a member of the Ecto team&lt;/a&gt;, he has made &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=is%3Apr+author%3Amichalmuskala&quot;&gt;plenty of contributions to Elixir&lt;/a&gt;, often to improve performance, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/erlang/otp/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=is%3Apr+author%3Amichalmuskala&quot;&gt;is a frequent to contribute to Erlang/OTP too&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elixir v1.7 implements &lt;a href=&quot;http://erlang.org/eep/eeps/eep-0048.html&quot;&gt;EEP 48&lt;/a&gt;. EEP 48 aims to bring documentation interoperability across all languages running on the Erlang VM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, EEP 48 introduces the ability to annotate documentation with metadata, which we have made possible to leverage from Elixir:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-elixir highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;@moduledoc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sd&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;A brand new module&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;@moduledoc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;authors:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sd&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Jane&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sd&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Mary&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;since:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sd&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;1.4.0&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metadata can be given to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@moduledoc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@typedoc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@doc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have updated &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc&quot;&gt;the ExDoc tool&lt;/a&gt; to start leveraging metadata in order to provide better documentation for developers. Some of the improvements include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elixir’s interactive shell, IEx, has also been updated to print metadata:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://elixir-lang.org/images/contents/iex-metadata.png&quot; alt=&quot;IEx metadata&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Elixir allows any metadata to be given, those tools currently exhibit only &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:deprecated&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:since&lt;/code&gt;. Other keys may be shown in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those improvements are not exclusive to the standard library, they are available to every Elixir library and application. We hope one day they will be available to all applications running on the Erlang VM too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To access the new documentation format, developers should use &lt;a href=&quot;https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Code.html#fetch_docs/1&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Code.fetch_docs/1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We have always been proud of treating documentation as a first-class citizen and the ability to add structured information to the documentation is a further step in this direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-__stacktrace__-construct&quot;&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;__STACKTRACE__&lt;/code&gt; construct&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erlang/OTP 21.0 introduces a new way to retrieve the stacktrace that is lexically scoped and no longer relies on side-effects like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;System.stacktrace/0&lt;/code&gt; does. Before one would write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-elixir highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;something&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;may&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fail&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;rescue&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stacktrace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;reraise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stacktrace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Elixir v1.7, this can be written as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-elixir highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;something&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;may&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fail&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;rescue&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;__STACKTRACE__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;reraise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;__STACKTRACE__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This change may also yield performance improvements in the future, since the lexical scope allows us to track precisely when a stacktrace is used and we no longer need to keep references to stacktrace entries after the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; construct finishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other parts of the exception system have also been improved. For example, more information is provided in certain occurrences of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ArgumentError&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ArithmeticError&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;KeyError&lt;/code&gt; messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;erlangotp-logger-integration&quot;&gt;Erlang/OTP logger integration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erlang/OTP 21 includes a new &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:logger&lt;/code&gt; module. Elixir v1.7 fully integrates with the new &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:logger&lt;/code&gt; and leverages its metadata system. The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Logger.Translator&lt;/code&gt; mechanism has also been improved to export metadata, allowing custom Logger backends to leverage information such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:crash_reason&lt;/code&gt; - a two-element tuple with the throw/error/exit reason as the first argument and the stacktrace as the second&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:initial_call&lt;/code&gt; - the initial call that started the process&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:registered_name&lt;/code&gt; - the process’ registered name as an atom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recommend Elixir libraries that previously hooked into Erlang’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:error_logger&lt;/code&gt; to hook into &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Logger&lt;/code&gt; instead, in order to support all current and future Erlang/OTP versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;logger-compile-time-purging&quot;&gt;Logger compile-time purging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, Logger macros such as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;debug&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;info&lt;/code&gt;, and so on would always evaluate their arguments, even when nothing would be logged. From Elixir v1.7 the arguments are only evaluated when the message is logged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Logger configuration system also accepts a new option called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:compile_time_purge_matching&lt;/code&gt; that allows you to remove log calls with specific compile-time metadata. For example, to remove all logger calls from application &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:foo&lt;/code&gt; with level lower than &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:info&lt;/code&gt;, as well as remove all logger calls from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Bar.foo/3&lt;/code&gt;, you can use the following configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-elixir highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;compile_time_purge_matching:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;application:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;level_lower_than:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;module:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;function:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sd&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;foo/3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;exunit-improvements&quot;&gt;ExUnit improvements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hexdocs.pm/ex_unit/&quot;&gt;ExUnit&lt;/a&gt; is Elixir’s unit testing library. ExUnit has always leveraged Elixir macros to provide excellent error reports when a failure happens. For example, the following code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-elixir highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sd&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;fox jumps over the lazy dog&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sd&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;brown fox jumps over the dog&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;will fail with the following report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://elixir-lang.org/images/contents/exunit-diff.png&quot; alt=&quot;ExUnit Diff&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt; macro is able to look at the code, extract the current file, the line, extract the operands and show a diff between the data structures alongside the stacktrace when the assertion fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, sometimes we need to write assertions such as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;assert some_function(expr1, var2)&lt;/code&gt;. When such assertion fails, we usually have to re-run the tests, now debugging or printing the values of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;expr1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;var2&lt;/code&gt;. In Elixir v1.7, when a “bare” assertion fails, we will print the value of each argument individually. For a simple example such as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;assert some_vars(1 + 2, 3 + 4)&lt;/code&gt;, we get this report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://elixir-lang.org/images/contents/exunit-bare-assertion-diff.png&quot; alt=&quot;ExUnit Bare Asssertion Diff&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have also &lt;a href=&quot;https://hexdocs.pm/ex_unit/ExUnit.DocTest.html#content&quot;&gt;added coloring and diffing to doctests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While ExUnit is our test framework, Mix is our build tool. Developers typically run their tests by calling &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mix test&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mix test&lt;/code&gt; side of things, there is a new &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--failed&lt;/code&gt; flag that runs all tests that failed the last time they ran. Finally, coverage reports generated with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mix test --cover&lt;/code&gt; include a summary out of the box:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Generating cover results ...

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;summing-up&quot;&gt;Summing up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are really proud of this release, as it focuses mostly on quality of life improvements, instead of flashy new features. As Elixir continues to mature, expect more releases like this one. The full list of changes is available in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/releases/tag/v1.7.0&quot;&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have also seen important developments in other areas not directly related to the Elixir codebase:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have added &lt;a href=&quot;https://elixir-lang.org/development.html&quot;&gt;a “Development” section&lt;/a&gt; to the website, that outlines the Elixir team structure and goals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://doc.honeypot.io/elixir-documentary-2018/&quot;&gt;Elixir now has its own mini-documentary&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.honeypot.io/&quot;&gt;Honeypot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already highlighted some of the improvements in the ExDoc tool. Another improvement worth mentioning is the syntax highlighting is now done in Elixir itself, via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tmbb/makeup&quot;&gt;Makeup&lt;/a&gt; library. This gives us more control over the grammar, the style, and improves load times. If you would like to add support for other languages, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tmbb/makeup&quot;&gt;reach out&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, don’t forget &lt;a href=&quot;https://elixirconf.com/&quot;&gt;ElixirConf US&lt;/a&gt; is coming soon, in Bellevue, WA, September 4-7. Last year my keynote focused on the last 5 years with Elixir. This year we are ready to look into the 5 years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check &lt;a href=&quot;https://elixir-lang.org/install.html&quot;&gt;the Install section&lt;/a&gt; to get Elixir installed and read our &lt;a href=&quot;http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html&quot;&gt;Getting Started guide&lt;/a&gt; to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>We’re finally finished removing jQuery from &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/r2QL2aHBfa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; data-expanded-url=&quot;http://GitHub.com&quot; data-url=&quot;http://GitHub.com&quot; class=&quot;twitter_external_link dir-ltr tco-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;http://GitHub.com&quot;&gt;GitHub.com&lt;/a&gt; frontend. What did we replace it with? No framework whatsoever:

• querySelectorAll,
• fetch for ajax,
• delegated-events for event handling,
• polyfills for standard DOM stuff,
• CustomElements on the rise.</description>

<title>Senator Asks US Agencies to Remove Flash from Government Websites</title>
<link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/government/senator-asks-us-agencies-to-remove-flash-from-government-websites/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/government/senator-asks-us-agencies-to-remove-flash-from-government-websites/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Flash logo&quot; height=&quot;460&quot; src=&quot;https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/986406/Logos/flash_logo.png&quot; width=&quot;1250&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a letter sent today, Oregon Senator Ron Wyden asked officials from three government agencies to come up with solutions and procedures that mandate the removal of Adobe Flash content from all US government websites by August 1, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senator is urging US government officials to act in light of Adobe's Flash end-of-life date &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/software/adobe-to-kill-flash-media-player-in-2020/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;scheduled for the end of 2020&lt;/a&gt;, after which Adobe announced it would cease to provide any technical support for the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trying to avoid another Windows XP fiasco&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Wyden is hoping to avoid a situation like the one of Windows XP, which US government agencies still use, despite Microsoft retiring the operating system back in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The federal government has too often failed to transition away from software that has been decommissioned,&quot; Wyden wrote in his letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senator points out Flash's &quot;serious, largely unfixable cybersecurity issues&quot; as one of the reasons US government sites should take proactive steps from removing this technology of its sites even before the cut-off date, after which Adobe won't provide any security fixes at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyden would like that officials would:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;›   Mandate that government agencies shall not deploy new, Flash-based content on any federal website, effective within 60 days.&lt;br/&gt;›   Require federal agencies to remove all Flash-based content from their websites by August 1, 2019.&lt;br/&gt;›   Require agencies to remove Flash from desktop computers by August 1, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last point, the optimal plan, Wyden suggests, is that officials create a pilot program to remove Flash from the PCs of a small number of employees by March 1, 2019, and from all computers by August 1, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter, which you can read in full &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4618332-Wyden-Flash.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, is addressed to the heads of the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wyden previously asked that federal agencies use ad blockers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Senator Wyden also urged in a similar letter that US agencies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/senator-asks-white-house-cyber-chief-to-block-malicious-ads-on-government-networks/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;deploy ad blocking technologies&lt;/a&gt; to prevent malware delivered via malicious ads (malvertising) from infecting government networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/05/24/dod_failing_on_encryption/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;In another letter&lt;/a&gt;, he also urged Department of Defense officials to encrypt their websites by deploying technologies like HTTPS and HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at a conference in February, Parisa Tabriz, Director of Engineering at Google, said the percentage of daily Chrome users who've loaded at least one page containing Flash content per day has gone down from around 80% in 2014 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-chrome-flash-usage-declines-from-80-percent-in-2014-to-under-8-percent-today/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;to under 8% in early 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to web technology survey site W3Techs, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/software/flash-used-on-5-percent-of-all-websites-down-from-285-percent-seven-years-ago/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;only 4.9% of today's websites utilize Flash code&lt;/a&gt;, a number that has plummeted from a 28.5% market share recorded at the start of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google Unveils Titan Security Key, a Yubico-Like Phishing Resistant 2FA Device</title>
<link>https://www.cyberscoop.com/google-titan-security-key-2fa-anti-phishing/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cyberscoop.com/google-titan-security-key-2fa-anti-phishing/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Google’s workforce hasn’t suffered a single confirmed account takeover in over a year. The impressive security stat is due to small USB security keys issued to all 85,000 of the company’s employees. Companies that produce these small pieces of hardware, like Yubico, have seen tremendous growth over the last two years thanks to rapidly accelerating adoption — but they will now have fresh competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google will soon start widely selling its own Titan Security Key, which includes firmware developed by the omnipresent tech giant itself. The product is available now to Google Cloud customers and will eventually be available to general customers, the company announced Wednesday at its Google Cloud Next conference in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like similar keys from other companies, it will provide a second authentication factor for software use, network access, account management and other services. When the hardware is linked to an account, a password isn’t enough — the user must plug in the key and activate it before getting access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve long advocated the use of security keys as the strongest, most phishing-resistant authentication factor for high-value users, especially cloud admins, to protect against the potentially damaging consequences of credential theft,” Jennifer Lin, a Google Cloud product director, said. “Titan Security Key gives you even more peace of mind that your accounts are protected, with assurance from Google of the integrity of the physical key.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-28469&quot; src=&quot;https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cyberscoop-media/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/24142600/Screen-Shot-2018-07-24-at-11.25.13-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;573&quot; height=&quot;278&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s cloud customers typically give security keys to high-value users like administrators and root users where a compromise would be exceptionally damaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s built with a secure element including firmware we built ourselves,” Google’s Rob Sadowski said. “It provides a ton of security with very little interaction and effort on the part of the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud is the fastest growing cloud business in an increasingly competitive industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On the backend, all you have to do on the admin console is literally check a box that says ‘use Titan Security Keys for this app,'” Sadowski said. “It’s that simple. If there’s a man-in-the-middle attack or something of that kind, it won’t have the authenticated response and will reject the connection. Very simple, very powerful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a time when cybersecurity experts consider multifactor authentication a necessary step — despite &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cyberscoop.com/two-factor-authentication-duo-security-yubikey/&quot;&gt;most Americans remaining in the dark&lt;/a&gt; — security keys are typically considered the strongest defense against account takeovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last two years, Yubico has seen rapidly accelerating growth, to the point where “19 of the 20 biggest internet companies on the planet,” including Google, now use YubiKeys, according to Stina Ehrensvärd, founder and CEO of the Swedish-American company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past two years, Google has given its employees Yubikeys despite the fact that it runs and maintains its own Google Authenticator app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yubikeys cost Google less than their own authenticator app,” Ehrensvärd said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google declined to specify who its partners are in manufacturing Titan keys but it is not manufactured by or connected with Yubico, the company confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s Jess Leroy called the Titan Key the “next generation” following Google’s previous YubiKey offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phishing represents a huge threat. About 71 percent of all targeted attacks start with phishing attempts, according — it’s how hackers broke into the Democratic National Committee in 2016 and it’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.csoonline.com/article/3036837/security/phishing-remains-top-attack-vector-for-criminals-both-novice-and-professional.html&quot;&gt;the top attack vector&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=&quot;https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/10/25/how-hackers-broke-into-john-podesta-dnc-gmail-accounts/&quot;&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/21/as-tax-season-nears-be-prepared-for-irs-scams.html&quot;&gt;manner&lt;/a&gt; of targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other common forms of two-factor authentication include text-message codes and mobile apps like Google Authenticators but they can all be phished, intercepted and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cyberscoop.com/two-factor-authentication-nist-duo-security/&quot;&gt;hacked&lt;/a&gt; more easily than security keys, which typically are plug-and-play, without any special software drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the above options, however, are exponentially more secure than having no multifactor authentication at all. Users of any online service should demand and use multifactor authentication all over the web.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Security keys have been good to Google, so now it's promoting one of its own - Cyberscoop</og:title>
<og:description>Google’s workforce hasn’t suffered a single confirmed account takeover in over a year. The impressive security stat is due to small USB security keys issued to all 85,000 of the company’s employees. Companies that produce these small pieces of hardware, like Yubico, have seen tremendous growth over the last two years thanks to rapidly accelerating adoption — but they will now have fresh competition. Google will soon start widely selling its own Titan Security Key, which includes firmware developed by the omnipresent tech giant itself. The product is available now to Google Cloud customers and will eventually be available to general customers, the company announced Wednesday at its Google Cloud Next conference in San Francisco. Like similar keys from other companies, it will provide a second authentication factor for software use, network access, account management and other services. When the hardware is linked to an account, a password isn’t enough — the user must plug in …</og:description>

<title>GlaxoSmithKline makes $300M investment in 23andMe, forms 50-50 R&amp;D pact</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;GlaxoSmithKline has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/gsk-and-23andme-sign-agreement-to-leverage-genetic-insights-for-the-development-of-novel-medicines/&quot;&gt;made&lt;/a&gt; a $300 million equity investment in 23andMe as part of a deal that pulls it close to the consumer genetics pioneer. The partners are contributing preclinical programs to a 50-50 collaboration that will use 23andMe’s genotypic and phenotypic data to accelerate progress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement features multiple components. To get the relationship started, 23andMe and GSK are bringing existing programs into the collaboration. 23andMe is proposing to include its early-stage programs, while GSK is contributing its LRRK2 inhibitor. GSK thinks 23andMe’s database of people who know their LRRK2 variant status will help the Parkinson’s program enroll patients on the way to clinical proof of concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GSK and 23andMe will also work on earlier-stage programs. The partners plan to use 23andMe’s data to jointly discover drug targets. A joint GSK-23andMe team will then prioritize the targets based on the strength of the hypothesis, chances of drugging them and clinical opportunity. GSK and 23andMe expect to jointly progress “a number” of targets every year. Each company can advance targets independently, too. The partners will split the costs and profits related to these activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;footer&gt;
&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;These activities are set to take place over the next four years. The agreement also features an option to extend the collaboration into a fifth year. If that happens, GSK will become 23andMe’s exclusive drug target discovery collaborator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GSK has also secured itself a source of data to support its internal programs. 23andMe has greenlit GSK to analyze the database to validate its portfolio and support enrollment in its clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expectation is that the genetic and phenotypic information 23andMe has accrued on the users of its testing service will facilitate more targeted R&amp;amp;D activities, from target selection through to the identification of clinical trial participants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know that drug targets with genetic validation have a significantly higher chance of ultimately demonstrating benefit for patients and becoming medicines,” GSK CSO Hal Barron said in a statement. “Partnering with 23andMe ... will help to shift our research and development organization to be ‘driven by genetics’, and increase the impact GSK can have on patients.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GSK indicated its interest in becoming such a genetics-driven organization when it teamed up with the UK Biobank and Regeneron to sequence 500,000 volunteers in 2017. But the Big Pharma rethought its role in the collaboration at the turn of the year, leaving Regeneron to forge ahead with the sequencing with the financial support of AbbVie, Alnylam, AstraZeneca, Biogen and Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By switching its attention to 23andMe, GSK has furthered the turnaround of the genetic testing firm. 23andMe looked to be on the ropes when the FDA hit it with a warning letter in 2013. But the startup pivoted, stepping up its interest in drug discovery while working to resolve the standoff with the FDA. Deals with Genentech, Pfizer and a $250 million financing followed. &lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1:&lt;/strong&gt; The thing I loved most about working in developer relations at NeXT was how Steve could call anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He would burst in my office and say, “I’m gonna call Bill about TrueType,” and gesture for me to follow. A minute later he’d have Bill Gates on the speaker phone with me in fly-on-the-wall mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“BUT BILL! You ripped off Adobe and made John &lt;em&gt;cry&lt;/em&gt;.” (John Warnock was the CEO of Adobe.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Steve, we didn’t want to get into the font business. It’s a nightmare. But Adobe wouldn’t open their fonts until they had competition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One time Steve said, “I invited Jonathan Seybold here for a day. Make sure he gets access to everyone who can explain details, like 4 bits of transparency in our new color printers. Bring him to me at 4 o’clock.” Seybold Expos were &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; force in electronic publishing then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve let me be a fly on the wall for his two hours with Jonathan that day. It was fascinating to see Steve in intense listening mode, asking short questions and sitting patiently for Jonathan’s careful answers. “Jonathan, how are we different from Apple?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oh, that’s an important question. That deserves a thoughtful answer.” I’ve played Jonathan’s answer in my head 1,000 times since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc-attachments&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;cakedoc-lightbox-link&quot; href=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/3RQg3CBYrWC7_1532446901688.jpeg&quot; itemprop=&quot;sharedContent&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cakedoc-image&quot; src=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/3RQg3CBYrWC7_1532446901688.jpeg?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/3RQg3CBYrWC7_1532446901688.jpeg?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680 1x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/3RQg3CBYrWC7_1532446901688.jpeg?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/3RQg3CBYrWC7_1532446901688.jpeg?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Jonathan said we were just like Apple, but very different from Microsoft. Microsoft had turned software creation into a factory process. Three people would visit him with a 1.0 product who seemed to be product managers. They took notes furiously as he tried the product, which was never any good. As he pointed out the things he didn’t like they would enthusiastically say, “thank you Jonathan!” And they’d dig for more details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’d come back in a year with a much-improved 2.0 that was still not ready for prime time and the process would repeat. Finally they’d return with a 3.0 and it was good enough to get respect and market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple, on the other hand, would send its creator. He or she wanted to build something insanely great on the first try that would change the world. Their mission was to get Jonathan to love it. It was hard for him to give feedback because the creator would get ever more defensive and deflated if Jonathan tried. After awhile it was too uncomfortable and he stopped trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always wondered how Steve took that answer, because it described himself so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc-attachments&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;cakedoc-lightbox-link&quot; href=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/BpSksnMyK1w4_1532447172246.png&quot; itemprop=&quot;sharedContent&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cakedoc-image&quot; src=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/BpSksnMyK1w4_1532447172246.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/BpSksnMyK1w4_1532447172246.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680 1x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/BpSksnMyK1w4_1532447172246.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/BpSksnMyK1w4_1532447172246.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 3:&lt;/strong&gt; One visitor was George Fisher, the superstar CEO of high-flying Motorola. Their processors powered Apple and NeXT computers. He dropped a bomb that caught me completely by surprise: the Motorola 68000 line of processors we used was near its end of life because it had become too hard to cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer was to adopt their upcoming processor, the Motorola 88110. To me it felt like the kind of crushing blow that could kill our fragile company. We would have to design new hardware. Who knew how much work it would take to get our operating system to support it? I would have to tell our developers that their lives were going to get more complicated and expensive. What if Motorola didn’t get enough support for it and we had to change processors again?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, there was a widespread belief that Intel’s processors were also at an evolutionary dead-end and Microsoft would face our fate as well. I made a list of options: Sun’s Sparc chip? At least they had shown that you could move from the Motorola 68000 to a so-called Reduced Instruction Set chip and succeed. But they were our enemy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIPS, the respected chip company Silicon Graphics bought? That made us dependent on a competitor. But supporters of Motorola’s 88110 didn’t look like a who’s-who of the industry, except Apple, and I heard they were wavering.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can’t explain why I couldn’t just chill and trust Steve, George Fisher and our engineers. Who was I to to get so worked up over it? Steve called me at 11 one night to settle me down but I couldn’t let it go. I wanted to know what Intel was doing and everyone just shrugged. Steve had a philosophy of betting on technologies in the spring of their lives, not the autumn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day Steve held a meeting with our engineers and me where he punctuated the air dramatically with his finger and said, “This company will live or die by its choice to support the 88110.” I don’t know what came over me. I said “die.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc-attachments&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;cakedoc-lightbox-link&quot; href=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/GkgpztwJqjPc_1532447353049.png&quot; itemprop=&quot;sharedContent&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cakedoc-image&quot; src=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/GkgpztwJqjPc_1532447353049.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/GkgpztwJqjPc_1532447353049.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680 1x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/GkgpztwJqjPc_1532447353049.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/GkgpztwJqjPc_1532447353049.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 4:&lt;/strong&gt; That was the last word spoken in the meeting and I could tell Steve was mad. I was mad too. An engineer walked me to my office while saying it had been nice knowing me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I closed my office door, picked up the phone, and asked for Andy Grove. I wanted to know why they weren’t in the conversation. I guessed it was because we used the Intel i860 chip on one of our graphics boards and it didn’t impress us. But what were Michael Dell, Bill Gates and Andy going to do about the Intel 80486 facing the same fate as Motorola’s 68040? I had to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got Andy’s assistant on the phone. His assistants were executives-in-training who spent 2 years mentoring under Andy. I explained that if Steve heard about this call I would be fired. I justified the call by saying sometimes history has shown you have to do the right thing and keep it secret from Steve until later, as the Mac team famously did when they hid a Sony engineer in the Apple building so Steve wouldn’t find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I said I had no idea what Steve’s relationship with Andy was. For all I knew, Steve thought Intel chips were shit (the word Steve would have used). But I knew Steve liked people at the top of their fields who admired and mentored him. Could I meet with Andy and explain our situation so Andy could call Steve?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he would ask Andy. He called back and scheduled a two-hour meeting at Intel, saying Andy would be there. I suddenly felt I had to have an engineer there and sought William Parkhurst, who I admired as one of the most influential engineers we ever hired. I fessed up to my boss, Mike Slade, about what we were doing. Max Henry, Donna Simonides, William and I piled in my Honda Accord and headed for Intel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc-attachments&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;cakedoc-lightbox-link&quot; href=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/c31m3drQZscH_1532447533032.jpeg&quot; itemprop=&quot;sharedContent&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cakedoc-image&quot; src=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/c31m3drQZscH_1532447533032.jpeg?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/c31m3drQZscH_1532447533032.jpeg?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680 1x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/c31m3drQZscH_1532447533032.jpeg?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/c31m3drQZscH_1532447533032.jpeg?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 5:&lt;/strong&gt; Our engineers told us Intel chips were inferior to Motorola’s and they only became a standard because Intel had managed to convince IBM’s PC division to use them. I had read two of Andy’s books and was concerned that he was a salesman prone to exaggeration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that was exactly my impression when I met him. Motorola couldn’t push the 68040 past 40 megahertz and to their credit, 40 megahertz was insane! Oh my God. The only thing more insane was Intel’s 80486 running at 66 megahertz! Can you imagine? I was a physicist, I should know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s when Andy lost some credibility with me. I can’t remember exactly what he said about future speeds, but I seem to remember 400 megahertz or maybe even more. Oh, please. You’re claiming 10x more than Motorola? Everyone knows Motorola is the more technically capable company. You won’t be able to bullshit Steve the way you did IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet. He seemed so confident. Probably just a good actor?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought the plan should be for Andy to call Steve and admire him for all he’s done (not hard to do). Bring technical people up to meet Steve’s, offer a few really great engineers to do a test port of NeXTstep on Intel, and provide some funding. Maybe Steve would bite?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andy’s assistant said he’d keep me up to date on what happened next. I left wondering what Bill Gates and Michael Dell thought of Andy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc-attachments&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;cakedoc-lightbox-link&quot; href=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/McX7VsrrTmz0_1532447639934.jpeg&quot; itemprop=&quot;sharedContent&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cakedoc-image&quot; src=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/McX7VsrrTmz0_1532447639934.jpeg?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/McX7VsrrTmz0_1532447639934.jpeg?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680 1x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/McX7VsrrTmz0_1532447639934.jpeg?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/McX7VsrrTmz0_1532447639934.jpeg?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 6:&lt;/strong&gt; When the first call came it was to say Andy and a large contingent from Intel were meeting Steve in the big downstairs conference room. Andy’s assistant didn’t know who was involved on our side besides Steve. I never heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometime later Steve wandered in my office and asked if I thought porting NeXTstep to Intel was a good idea. Awkward. Did he know? I asked if Intel was going to help. Steve said they offered two great engineers to work alongside ours. They thought it could be done in 6 months. We’d have to keep it super secret from the outside world. Could I act as relationship manager?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t as strange as it sounded because I was managing the IBM relationship. Steve had licensed NeXTstep for them to use on their workstations years ago and they had a team living at NeXT working on it. We didn’t have much faith in that relationship.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hmmm, that sounds like a good idea, Steve. The 66 megahertz 80486 chip?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yeah. Intel’s graphics primitives are shit so it probably won’t be any faster than the 33 megahertz 68040 we’re using now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six months later I carried a beige Intel-based computer from a windowless room to my office, wrapped in a black cover. It was exactly twice the speed of our sexy black machines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 7:&lt;/strong&gt; Steve and William had made plans to package NeXTstep as software for retail sales at Comp USA and other stores. I didn’t see that coming. I was angling for building sleek black machines with Intel inside, but we were sticking to the plan of making a dual-88110 workstation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The belief was the future of computing was Reduced Instruction Set architectures, not a PC-based chip. All the workstation companies like Sun, HP, Silicon Graphics and IBM had gone that way. I don’t think the workstation world believed that Andy could keep increasing the speed of his processors like he claimed he could. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understood. Andy came across as a bit of a slickster to me whereas George Fischer was the real deal, the man The New York Times referred to as a gold-plated executive in a 12-carat company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 8:&lt;/strong&gt; I got a call a few months later from General Magic. Their vision was so compelling I accepted their offer to work there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selling NeXTstep as software wasn’t going well and NeXT discontinued making hardware before they could ship the 88110-based workstation. Far as I knew, only Data General was making a machine with 88110s. Apple had abandoned it and teamed up with IBM &amp;amp; Motorola to produce the PowerPC processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NeXT became less relevant, but word was Steve and Andy were getting along. Andy conducted offsites with Steve and his team to teach his management methods that would become so famous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George Fisher made a fateful decision to become CEO of Kodak. The reputations of Motorola, Kodak, or George would never be the same again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then news broke that would change the world: Apple bought NeXT and Steve became CEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 9:&lt;/strong&gt; The man who made the decision to buy NeXT was Gil Amelio, CEO of Apple at the time and former CEO of National Semiconductor. He wrote a book about how he saved Apple. He agreed to speak at a bookstore in San Jose that I owned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He only took one question at the end. He called on John Markoff, the famous New York Times tech journalist. “Gil,” John asked, “why did you end up buying NeXT instead of Be?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be OS, like NeXTstep, was very respected and the man who ran Be was Jean-Louis Gassée, former high-profile Apple exec. Steve told Walter Isaacson that Gassée was &quot;one of the few people who I'd say is truly horrible. He knifed me in the back.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how I’ve remembered Gil’s answer over the years: “Great question, we had big internal debates about that. A lot of people at Apple were afraid of Steve and Jean-Louis had many supporters. Be OS was very respected. In the end it came down to NeXT already supporting Intel and that was important to us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remember thinking, &lt;em&gt;oh my God. Steve, you owe me&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc-attachments&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;cakedoc-lightbox-link&quot; href=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/xqKXBM1gCNRG_1532450088239.png&quot; itemprop=&quot;sharedContent&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cakedoc-image&quot; src=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/xqKXBM1gCNRG_1532450088239.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/xqKXBM1gCNRG_1532450088239.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680 1x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/xqKXBM1gCNRG_1532450088239.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/xqKXBM1gCNRG_1532450088239.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 10:&lt;/strong&gt; Turns out I wasn’t the only one to make secret calls and Andy wasn’t the only one to return them. John Landwehr was a product manager at NeXT who got the idea to call Ellen Hancock, Apple’s CTO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/23/business/why-apple-sees-next-as-a-match-made-in-heaven.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an article by John Markoff&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading newspaper accounts saying that Apple was in private discussions about acquiring a new operating system, Mr. Landwehr, without a word to Steven P. Jobs, his company's chairman, persuaded his colleague Garrett Rice to pick up the phone and call Ms. Hancock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out Andy was underselling when he said his processors might go to 400 megahertz, 10x what Motorola ever achieved with the 68040. The clock speeds of current Intel processors are more than 4200 megahertz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 10 years after the computing world believed Intel’s processors were in the autumn of their lives, Apple based their computers on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gil Amelio:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 11 (last part):&lt;/strong&gt; The Harvard Business Review published an article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2002/09/the-curse-of-the-superstar-ceo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Curse of the Superstar CEO&lt;/a&gt;, which tried to explain the fall of George Fisher and Kodak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I always wonder. Was it really about the CEOs? Or were there technical superstars we don’t know about who figured out how to make processors faster without overheating? That’s something I loved about Steve Jobs: he would ask who on planet earth is the best person to pull off something impossible and he would do anything to hire them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know one of those. Steve spent all day in early Apple recruiting Bill Atkinson, a Phd student in neuroscience. Steve told me he didn’t know if they could have pulled off the Mac without him. I have seen Bill solve hard technical problems I don’t think anyone else could solve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if Andy had one of those and George didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs and Bill Atkinson:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris, all kidding aside.....I hope you have plans to write a book. It would be VERY interesting and it seems your &quot;fly-on-the-wall&quot; perspectives are historically important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've often wondered what the computing world would look like today if Apple had bought Be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BeOS&lt;/a&gt; was a fantastic operating system, more advanced in many ways than other OSes of the era. I actually very briefly used it as my primary OS in the late 90s. But Be wasn't able to succeed as an independent company, and with the release of Mac OS X (which was heavily based on concepts and code from NeXT), Apple suddenly had a much better OS, and BeOS was relegated to the history books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But somewhere out there is a parallel universe where BeOS, rather than OpenStep, became the basis for Apple's new OS. Would it have been able to compete with Windows? Without macOS's BSD underpinnings, would it have been as popular with developers as Mac OS X was? I wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc-attachments&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;cakedoc-lightbox-link&quot; href=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/R987rtpTCkPw_1532457294986.png&quot; itemprop=&quot;sharedContent&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cakedoc-image&quot; src=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/R987rtpTCkPw_1532457294986.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cake.imgix.net/m/R987rtpTCkPw_1532457294986.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680 1x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/R987rtpTCkPw_1532457294986.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://cake.imgix.net/m/R987rtpTCkPw_1532457294986.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=pjpg&amp;amp;h=640&amp;amp;q=65&amp;amp;w=680&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great read, and made me miss my days working on my old NeXT work stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was an incredible read. You've lived quite the life. I'll have to check out more about Bill Atkinson. I wonder what sort of neuroscience he worked on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great series of posts, Chris! At Microsoft, we used to say that “the #1 feature is shipping”. It wasn’t always good for customers, but it sure did let msft exploit their user base to quickly learn and develop a decent product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazing story!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it always amazes me what it takes for things to happen good and bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this didn’t happen this wouldn’t have happened. Almost at times like there is some sort of design going on in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cakedoc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fascinating. Tangentially, Intel saved the X86 architecture (boosting it 10x, 100x, etc.) after DIGITAL had asked them to &quot;analyze&quot; its breakthrough MicroPrism (aka DEC Alpha) chip for &quot;second sourcing&quot; at Intel's state-of-the-art FABs. The dishonesty of lifting that IP to &quot;rescue&quot; the X86 led to a legal settlement wherein Intel consented to purchase DEC's Hudson plant, that included not just the Alpha's chips, but also the StrongARM chips. (Old money on both boards and that's the way they handle scandals.) Chris' testimonial makes me believe that more people besides Andy Grove at Intel knew that the X86 was being &quot;rescued&quot; in this way...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I totally agree with Steve about Gassée, convinced there was an Amiga 1000 in the basement of One Infinite Loop fueling all of that period's innovations (GfxBase-&amp;gt;QuickDrawGX, ARexx-&amp;gt;AppleScript, Speech-&amp;gt;PlainTalk, etc..) sustaining an unbelievable amount of politics much to Bill Gates' delight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

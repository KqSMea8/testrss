<title>Mark Zuckerberg and his empire of oily rags</title>
<link>https://craphound.com/news/2018/07/02/mark-zuckerberg-and-his-empire-of-oily-rags/</link>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;Surveillance capitalism sucks: it improves the scattershot, low-performance success-rate of untargeted advertising (well below 1 percent) and doubles or triples it (to well below 1 percent!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-8665&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But surveillance captialism is still dangerous: all those dossiers on the personal lives of whole populations can be used for blackmail, identity theft and political manipulation. As I explain in my new Locus column, &lt;a href=&quot;http://locusmag.com/2018/07/cory-doctorow-zucks-empire-of-oily-rags/&quot;&gt;Cory Doctorow: Zuck’s Empire of Oily Rags&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook’s secret is that they’ve found a way to turn a profit on an incredibly low-yield resource — like figuring out how to make low-grade crude out of the oil left over from oily rags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But because the margins on surveillance data are so poor, the business is only sustainable if it fails to take the kinds of prudent precautions that would make it safe to warehouse these unimaginably gigantic piles of oily rags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s as though Mark Zuckerberg woke up one morning and realized that the oily rags he’d been accumulating in his garage could be refined for an extremely low-grade, low-value crude oil. No one would pay very much for this oil, but there were a lot of oily rags, and provided no one asked him to pay for the inevitable horrific fires that would result from filling the world’s garages with oily rags, he could turn a tidy profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decade later, everything is on fire and we’re trying to tell Zuck and his friends that they’re going to need to pay for the damage and install the kinds of fire-suppression gear that anyone storing oily rags should have invested in from the beginning, and the commercial surveillance industry is absolutely unwilling to contemplate anything of the sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s because dossiers on billions of people hold the power to wreak almost unimaginable harm, and yet, each dossier brings in just a few dollars a year. For commercial surveillance to be cost effective, it has to socialize all the risks associated with mass surveillance and privatize all the gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s an old-fashioned word for this: corruption. In corrupt systems, a few bad actors cost everyone else billions in order to bring in millions – the savings a factory can realize from dumping pollution in the water supply are much smaller than the costs we all bear from being poisoned by effluent. But the costs are widely diffused while the gains are tightly concentrated, so the beneficiaries of corruption can always outspend their victims to stay clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook doesn’t have a mind-control problem, it has a corruption problem. Cambridge Analytica didn’t convince decent people to become racists; they convinced racists to become voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://locusmag.com/2018/07/cory-doctorow-zucks-empire-of-oily-rags/&quot;&gt;Cory Doctorow: Zuck’s Empire of Oily Rags&lt;/a&gt; [Cory Doctorow/Locus]&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How a Microsoft Font Brought Down Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif (2017)</title>
<link>https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/how-a-microsoft-font-brought-down-pakistani-prime-minister-nawaz-sharif/article35828938/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/how-a-microsoft-font-brought-down-pakistani-prime-minister-nawaz-sharif/article35828938/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;Friday's ouster of Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif wasn't just a momentous event in the Asian country but also big news for fans of typography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;A key part of the corruption case that led to Mr. Sharif's removal from power hinged on the typeface used in a financial document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;The controversy was therefore dubbed Fontgate and on Friday, headline writers and wags on Twitter were saying that Pakistan was now &quot;Sans Sharif.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;u-wrapper pb-feature pb-layout-item pb-f-commercial-dfp-ads&quot; data-fn=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;c-ad--flex-gpt-1&quot; class=&quot;c-ad c-ad--inline c-ad--flex&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-ad__wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-ad__message&quot;&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;It all hinged on a document that the Sharif family had produced in an attempt to distance the prime minister from questions about who owned four properties in an upscale part of London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;The document was purported to be written in February 2006 but court-appointed investigators concluded that it was forged, noting that it used the Calibri font, a Microsoft licensed typeface that was not commercially available at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;u-wrapper pb-feature pb-layout-item pb-f-article-asf-body-top&quot; data-fn=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;o-article-asf__top u-clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;c-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/files/graphics/0728-nw-calibri/calibri.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;&quot;The said document is fake, fabricated and not worthy of any reliance,&quot; Pakistan's Supreme Court said in an April ruling, summarizing the submissions of a lawyer for the opposition party of Imran Khan, which had petitioned for Mr. Sharif's removal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;The case began last year with the disclosure of the Panama Papers, a trove of leaked documents from Mossack Fonseca, a law firm providing offshore financial services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;The leaked papers revealed connections between the Sharif family and four properties at Avenfield House, a luxury building on Park Lane, in the heart of London's ultrawealthy Mayfair district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;The properties were held by two Panama-based offshore companies. The Supreme Court heard that e-mails and documents showed that the sole shareholder of the two companies was Mr. Sharif's daughter, Maryam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;She produced a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MaryamNSharif/status/798473994659713024/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;letter dated Feb. 2, 2006&lt;/a&gt;, stating that she was just the trustee of those assets, on behalf of her brother Hussain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;u-wrapper pb-feature pb-layout-item pb-f-commercial-dfp-ads&quot; data-fn=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;c-ad--flex-gpt-2&quot; class=&quot;c-ad c-ad--inline c-ad--flex&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-ad__wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-ad__message&quot;&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;js-ad-slimcut-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;c-ad c-ad--slimcut u-hidden&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-ad__wrapper&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-ad__message&quot;&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;However, an investigative team set up by the court ordered a forensic analysis of the letter. They found that the trust deed was produced in the Calibri font.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;Calibri, which was commissioned by Microsoft for its Windows operating system, began appearing in pre-release &quot;beta&quot; versions in 2004 that were being tested by professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;However, it was not commercially available until Jan. 31, 2007, the investigating team said in its report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;The connection between the properties and Maryam would be fatal for the prime minister because, as opposition lawyers argued in court, in his mandated asset declarations, he had listed her as a dependent but had not disclosed the London penthouses.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Vue.js: the good, the meh, and the ugly</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://medium.com/@Pier/vue-js-the-good-the-meh-and-the-ugly-82800bbe6684</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn&quot; readability=&quot;51.317789968652&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;cda5&quot; id=&quot;cda5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf--leading&quot;&gt;The Meh&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;62c7&quot; id=&quot;62c7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Component boilerplate&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;da31&quot; id=&quot;da31&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Moving from React to Vue seems like a breath of fresh air. No more &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;bind(this)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;setState()&lt;/code&gt; everywhere. Yay! But after a while, you start to question the validity of Vue’s component syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3610&quot; id=&quot;3610&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Vue components are created with objects and here’s an example of defining a component function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;2456&quot; id=&quot;2456&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
export default {&lt;br/&gt;methods: {&lt;br/&gt;increment () {&lt;br/&gt;this.count++;&lt;br/&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e24e&quot; id=&quot;e24e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;You’ll be adding similar boilerplate for computed properties, component state, watchers, etc. Pretty much everything in Vue has its own special syntax with more boilerplate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8769&quot; id=&quot;8769&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In contrast here’s the same thing for &lt;a href=&quot;https://markojs.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://markojs.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Marko&lt;/a&gt; which is way cleaner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;b6a8&quot; id=&quot;b6a8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
class {&lt;br/&gt;increment() {&lt;br/&gt;this.state.count++;&lt;br/&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7bec&quot; id=&quot;7bec&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;My point here is not about using classes or not, but that Vue is using arbitrary object structures instead of language features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3b2e&quot; id=&quot;3b2e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I won’t blame you if you feel a little dirty by having to create these annoying objects. Vue also offers a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue-class-component&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue-class-component&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;class based syntax&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s really more of an afterthought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;487a&quot; id=&quot;487a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Chat based community&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;94e2&quot; id=&quot;94e2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;The Vue community hangs out on Discord, a chat designed for gamer communities. If you hit a roadblock the chat is probably your best bet since the official forums are a desolate land, and don’t you dare ask a question on Github.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e6b4&quot; id=&quot;e6b4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Chats are messy, but the main problem is that chat content can’t be indexed by search engines. The same questions (and its related discussions) are doomed to be repeated again and again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9d12&quot; id=&quot;9d12&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This trend of using chats for questions is plaguing open source projects and I think it needs to end. There is no collective learning anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;1fb7&quot; id=&quot;1fb7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Not so magic&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4d63&quot; id=&quot;4d63&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;As long as you don’t steer away from the golden path everything will be fine, but after some time you will probably find lots of little &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;ifs&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;buts&lt;/em&gt; around Vue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c0f5&quot; id=&quot;c0f5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;70cb&quot; id=&quot;70cb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The reactivity system will only track changes under certain conditions. Don’t expect to throw anything you wish at it. Quite often you may need to flatten your data as much as possible to avoid headaches. Of course, it’s all explained in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fine print of the documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;0332&quot; id=&quot;0332&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;The transition system &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--li-code&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;vue-transition&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; does not work for lists. You actually need to use &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--li-code&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;transition-group&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; which works slightly differently and introduces new elements in your DOM. Also, one would expect staggering to be a solved thing, but you have to implement it &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitions.html#Staggering-List-Transitions&quot; data-href=&quot;https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitions.html#Staggering-List-Transitions&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;yourself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;3b79&quot; id=&quot;3b79&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;If you need non-reactive state in a component instance you will be into &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/1988&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/1988&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;uncharted territory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;950c&quot; id=&quot;950c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;96a6&quot; id=&quot;96a6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;Don’t get me wrong, these are not deal breakers, but it seems every time you start scratching the surface another minor annoyance pops up.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The U.S. Air Force learned to code and saved the Pentagon millions</title>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In October 2016, Eric Schmidt found himself in the Arab Gulf nation of Qatar. Then executive chairman of Alphabet, Inc., Google’s parent company, Schmidt was touring military installations in his role as chairman of the Defense Innovation Board (DIB), whose mandate was to provide the U.S. secretary of defense with “independent advice and recommendations on innovative means to address future challenges.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--mobileparallax_1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;68&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the Air Operations Center (AOC) at Qatar’s Al Udeid Air Base, Schmidt saw up close the way that today’s U.S. Air Force meets its enormous challenges: with magnets and colored plastic cards. The Air Force was then engaged in an offensive against the so-called Islamic State forces in Mosul, Iraq. But when Schmidt asked an AOC commander what his biggest concern was, he got a surprising answer. As Schmidt told me, “He said, ‘Well, frankly, it’s something different: I don’t want them to erase my whiteboard.'”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The AOC at Al Udeid is where AFCENT, the U.S. Air Forces Central Command, oversees air force operations for over 20 countries from Egypt to Kazakhstan. An enormous amount of data is pushed through the center every day, through a system of 43 software applications that help with everything from assessing targets to planning attacks, getting information to pilots, monitoring operations, analyzing damage done, and more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-40589181 lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;348&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/06/i-schmidt-04-DIBDVIDS3899977.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eric Schmidt&lt;/strong&gt; (center) and other members of the Defense Innovation Board. [Photo: Cmdr. Patrick Evans, courtesy Office of the Secretary of Defense]&lt;span&gt;Not all the functions of the AOC are carried out on a computer, however. The whiteboard, as Schmidt and other DIB members soon discovered, was where daily planning took place for AFCENT’s aerial refueling operations. “We got the missions for the day, figured out what targets needed to be hit, and how much fuel was needed, who needed the fuel, and when they needed it,” explains U.S. Colonel Mike Drowley, AFCENT chief of staff. “It was an eight- or nine-hour process [for three or more people] to try and figure all the ins and outs. It was like a Tetris game of blocks and pucks.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s a literal description. “They would actually use physical distance on the whiteboard to determine whether they could meet their mission,” Schmidt said. To do so, a person called “the Gonker” entered data into an Excel spreadsheet known as “the Gonkulator,” while “the Planner” arranged magnetic pucks and plastic laminated cards on the whiteboard to indicate how long planes could stay in the air.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-40589187 lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;295&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/06/i-02-tankerwhiteboard.jpg&quot;/&gt;The whiteboard on which tanker refueling operations were planned. [Photo: courtesy of U.S. Air Force]&lt;span&gt;“They had a VBScript that they ran when the spreadsheet was correct,” said Milo Medin, a Google vice president who is also on the innovation board. “That would generate an input that had to be manually typed in.” The person doing that typing was called “the Thumper,” and the destination for that data was the Master Air Attack Planning Toolkit, which helped generate an attack plan known as an Air Tasking Order at AFCENT headquarters at Shaw Air Base in South Carolina.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For Schmidt, the obvious question was whether the base had access to more modern software. “And the answer came back, ‘Yes, but it doesn’t work,'” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--mobilerectangle_1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;56&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The comment around the group was, this just isn’t that hard a problem to solve,” said board member and Caltech professor Richard Murray, who was in Qatar with Schmidt and Medin. “It was sort of hard to comprehend why the original software couldn’t solve it. You could imagine it had been written a long time ago, it just couldn’t handle this number of tankers, whatever, fine. But can’t you just go fix this? And the answer was basically, no.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“That can’t be the right answer,” Murray said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But under federal regulations, it is. Standard DoD procedure requires systems like the AOC software to be competitively bid, and for the winning contractor to design, build, certify, and test the entire system before delivering it to users—and then to go through the entire process again each time any appreciable amount of code needed to be changed. That’s in part why the Air Operations Center software had been in use more or less unchanged since the 1990s.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the board’s visit set off a singular chain of events, and less than six months later, tanker planning at the Qatar AOC was being done via state-of-the-art software that saved hours every day and millions of dollars every week. And much of the rest of the AOC software was also being overhauled—by a fast-moving cadre of Air Force engineers working hand-in-hand with Pivotal Software to step in where a $745 million contract with a big defense contractor had produced nothing over the previous five years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

[Photo: courtesy of U.S. Air Force]&lt;span&gt;The Air Force team writing this wartime code draws its inspiration from pop culture and the need to move fast. But its broader mission is more serious: to do away with the red tape that keeps the armed forces from moving past things like whiteboards and plastic cards, even for critical missions. The tools it has worked on were developed and deployed in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost of most contracts that take on similar work. But can it get the Air Force, and the Department of Defense more broadly, to undertake the badly needed update to the way they conceive of, acquire, and deploy the software—and, just maybe, the hardware—that are the tools the armed forces rely on in war?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reporting for coworking duty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The latest in U.S. Air Force technological advances can be found in an unlikely place: the WeWork coworking space on Portland Street in downtown Boston. There, a couple of dozen Air Force enlisted men and women report for duty every day. None are in dress uniform, or even flight suits; most are in jeans and sneakers. A handful wear T-shirts emblazoned with their outfit’s logo: the silhouette of a familiar-looking spaceship—the ship that made the Kessel Run in under 12 parsecs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;59&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It may seem strange to find a bunch of Air Force personnel showing up in downtown Boston in Millennium Falcon shirts to write code. But strange—or at least, different—is exactly what the Air Force is after. The enlisted personnel in Boston are dressed less like pilots than like software developers, because that’s exactly what they are. Their small, open-plan office at WeWork holds ranks of keyboards and monitors—as well as another couple of dozen software engineers on loan from the nearby offices of Pivotal Software and other civilian companies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the day I visited it recently, it was impossible to tell enlisted from Pivots and consultants. The office was a hum of conversation and activity, and a passel of visiting dignitaries—including Schmidt and other DIB members—were moving around the narrow space getting a tour. This was the unofficial opening day of the Kessel Run Experimentation Lab, as the Air Force’s WeWork office has been dubbed, and the place looked more like a growing startup than a military outfit. While Kessel Run is an official Air Force program with an entertaining name, it’s also a highly unusual arrangement, one in which enlisted men and women are crafting the components of one of the Air Force’s most important weapons systems—a job normally done by big defense contractors, and overseen by beleaguered acquisitions officers in the Pentagon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-40589206 lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/06/i-03-KesselRunDoor.jpg&quot;/&gt;The Kessel Run office in Boston. [Photo: U.S. Air Force photo by Todd Maki]&lt;span&gt;But getting this far has not been easy. Kessel Run was born from crisis and serendipity, and midwifed by a Secretary of Defense who knew enough to put the pieces into place and then get out of the way. It’s taken the Air Force two years, sustained advocacy on Capitol Hill, and the efforts of everyone from the Secretary of the Air Force to Eric Schmidt to Pivotal Software to enlisted personnel from Qatar to Silicon Valley. And the project nearly died several times along the way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Defense Innovation Board (launched by Ashton Carter, then Secretary of Defense, in early 2016) was taken aback to learn that the AOC software in Qatar was more than two decades old, and that regulations made it nearly impossible to update. But at some point during the whiteboard presentation, Schmidt recalls, he leaned over and said to another person on the AOC tour, “Couldn’t you do something about this?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That person was Raj Shah, and it just so happened that Shah had on his staff someone who had been waiting for the chance to tackle just such a project for some time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Building stupid cards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shah at the time was managing partner of the Defense Innovation Unit-Experimental, or DIUx, another office stood up by Ash Carter. He is also a former fighter pilot who has flown combat missions out of Iraq. “Having refueled four times a day when I was deployed, I was very familiar with the output” of the tanker planning process, he said. “I’d been in situations where the tanker didn’t show for a time, and as a receiver getting gas, if they’re not there you get very angry.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;71&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For a force that flies something like 25,000 sorties a year, coordinating aerial refueling is no trivial task. Whiteboard planning is imperfect. So the Air Force keeps tankers loaded with fuel and ready to scramble at a moment’s notice, to cover gaps like the ones that irked Shah.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-40589225 lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;351&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/06/i-05-RefuelDVIDS3422005.jpg&quot;/&gt;An Air Force KC-135 Stratotanker out of Al Udeid refuels a Navy F/A-18C Strike Fighter. [Photo: U.S. Air National Guard photo by Master Sgt. Andrew J. Moseley]&lt;span&gt;Shah knew the other side of the process as well, from his days as a young airman in Iraq. “When I was first deployed, in 2006, I would get a printout via email [from the AOC] of where everybody’s supposed to go,” he told me. “Then my job is to turn it into mission materials that pilots fly, because I’m the junior guy in the squadron.” That process involved spending six hours a night copying and pasting text to produce cards that pilots would consult to execute their missions. “After about two weeks there, spending six hours a night building stupid cards, I was like, there’s gotta be a better way. I was literally taking stuff off a sheet, highlighting it, and translating it. So I built an Excel macro that did it all.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In fact, many of the AOC applications ran at a similar level of sophistication. “It was endemic of the entire [AOC] that all the new tools were based on Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint, because those were the only approved solutions,” Shah said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even things like choosing and analyzing targets and passing targeting information to pilots in planes was done with the same tools, often requiring airmen to read data off one screen on one system and then type it into another. “They were cut and pasting, sometimes writing things down, and clearly affording themselves plenty of opportunities to make a mistake,” Lieutenant General Jeffrey Harrigian, commander of U.S. AFCENT, told me. “It was on the shoulders of our great folks that we very, very rarely had any bad data passed to the folks in the jets. But clearly there’s got to be a better way to fuse this information where you minimize the possibility of air-gapping information from one operation to another.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-40589219 lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;351&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/06/i-09-CarterShashDVIDS2585883.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashton Carter&lt;/strong&gt;, then secretary of defense, speaks with reporters at DIUx headquarters, as &lt;strong&gt;Raj Shah&lt;/strong&gt; looks on. [Photo: Senior Master Sgt. Adrian Cadiz]&lt;span&gt;If the AOC software hasn’t seen an appreciable upgrade in more than 20 years, it’s not for lack of trying. Lockheed Martin was initially awarded a $589 million contract in 2006 to “standardize, modernize, sustain, and transform” more than 20 AOCs around the world. Initial work to hash out an upgrade of the 1990s-era “AOC 10.1” to a networked and secure “AOC 10.2” began in 2007. But in 2013, when the Air Force solicited bids for the bulk of the work, Lockheed declined to submit one. The deal went instead to another big defense contractor, Northrop Grumman. But by the fall of 2016, when Shah and the DIB visited Qatar, Northrop was running years behind schedule and hundreds of millions of dollars over budget, leaving the future of one of the Air Force’s most important software systems uncertain, at best.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The whiteboard problem resonated with Shah, who was five months into his job. DIUx locates startups and other innovative private-sector companies to help produce fast solutions to some of the challenges faced by the DoD. The scope of the tanker planning problem was just the kind of challenge Shah was looking for. And he knew that a fast-talking lieutenant colonel named Enrique Oti had been champing at the bit to tackle such a problem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--mobilerectangle_3&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;49&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I called Enrique literally that night,” Shah recalls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Buying risk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A career Air Force officer, Oti was appointed head of Air Force programs at DIUx when the outfit launched in August 2015. He had already begun to sketch out concepts for an “air operation center of the future” with the help of a consultancy called BMNT, a of private-sector counterpart to DIUx led by retired colonel Pete Newell, who had headed the Army’s Rapid Equipping Force.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shah had a more modest proposal. Instead of tackling the whole AOC, Shah suggested, “Why don’t you guys just build this tanker whiteboard? We’ll put a million bucks of DIUx money into it, but just go do this. Start tomorrow.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Oti did. “I literally sent out a bunch of emails to all the squadron commanders I knew out there, saying, ‘Hey, does anybody have any airmen that can write code?'” he said. Within a week, Oti had dozens of responses (including some from airmen who claimed to be able to code but couldn’t). With no background in software development himself, Oti was winging it. “I figured, I’ll grab six guys and I’ll see what they can do,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Oti ran the plan by AFCENT commander Harrigian, who gave it his cautious blessing. “I had to accept the fact that we were going to try something a bit different while we were fighting a war. I had to be willing to buy some risk,” he told me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To get Pivotal on the job fast, Oti leveraged a few contracting instruments that are normally eschewed by risk-averse Pentagon bureaucrats. With Pivotal on board, four of the Air Force coders were paired with four Pivots, as dictated by the company’s adherence to a software development methodology known as Extreme Programming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;49&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The DIB had visited Qatar in October. By Christmas, Oti and Shah had coders and product managers back at the AOC to talk to prospective users about what they needed. By April 2017 the tanker planning tool—named JIGSAW—was in use in Qatar. “Four months from start to in production, in use in combat operations,” Oti says. The average DoD software project takes almost three years, according to a recent study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;JIGSAW cost a grand total of $2.2 million, according to Shah. The new software is not only saving time—planning now takes a matter of two to three hours, rather than all day—but is also more reliable: AFCENT now scrambles two to three fewer tankers each day—at a cost of about $250,000 each. That means the project paid for itself in under a week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And the whiteboard on which airmen formerly did tanker planning? It’s being installed in a museum at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base outside Dayton, Ohio.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Soul searching in Silicon Valley&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With JIGSAW under their belt, the team set their sights on more AOC software. But first they needed to sell the idea to the Air Force’s Life Cycle Management Center (LCMC), which is typically in change of such projects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There was resistance, at first, to some of the ideas being presented. And other rough spots as well: Oti initially clashed with the program manager for the AOC, Colonel Jeremiah Sanders, one person told me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It was bumpy for a while,” says Hunter Price, director of Air Force programs at the Defense Digital Service, which helped Oti and DIUx in their campaign to win over Air Force leadership. “The program office went through a conversion process. They knew they were out in the wilderness, they knew the AOC wasn’t working well. There was some soul searching.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;65&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That soul searching was brought on, in part, by the stalled AOC contract with Northrop Grumman, according to Sanders. “Through crisis came great opportunity,” Sanders told me. The success of the tanker planning tool “allowed us to try something really revolutionarily different.” Sanders describes the kind of iteration inherent to modern software development as a fundamental change in the DoD’s approach to software acquisition, one that “expansively transforms how we approach requirements.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I didn’t have a good appreciation, nor did my team when we started, of just how significant that transformation would become,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-40589221 lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/06/i-08-FurtadoPresentation.jpg&quot;/&gt;Kessel Run’s &lt;strong&gt;Adam Furtado&lt;/strong&gt; welcomes new engineers to the team. [Photo: U.S. Air Force photo by Todd Maki]&lt;span&gt;Part of that transformation involves a close partnership with Pivotal, who not only helps write code for the AOC but also trains the Air Force engineers who are the backbone of the program. “We don’t want to be anybody’s outsource app development organization forever,” says Keith Salisbury, the vice president responsible for Pivotal’s work with the federal government. “We want our clients to understand what we do and how we do it, and most importantly, why we do it. We don’t want to teach them to fish. We want to teach them to be fishing guides.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After JIGSAW, the team got to work on a pair of applications that would help streamline the problems Harrigian described in assembling targeting information, deciding how and when to attack those targets, and getting that information to pilots. One of those two applications—named RAVEN and CHAINSAW—was in operation by the end of 2017, the other soon thereafter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With offices in Boston, Chicago, and Silicon Valley, there are now about 100 people on the Kessel Run team. By this spring, Kessel Run had delivered five AOC applications and had eight more in development. The Boston operation is slated to grow to around 300 people this summer and take over an entire floor of the WeWork space. “By the end of this year I hope we’re going to be up to 15 to 18 [applications],” Oti says. It may not be the operations center of the future, but, he says, “We’re out to tackle the whole AOC.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The name Kessel Run has now become part of a culture that the team’s leaders knew would have to differ markedly from how the military normally does business. “Culture is the hardest thing,” says Air Force Captain Bryon Kroger, Kessel Run’s COO. “One thing that’s really hard is psychological safety. Something we talk a lot about is, How do you create an environment where truly people feel safe to fail? Making that happen is hard. Adam [Furtado, Kessel Run’s chief of product] and I are both military, Colonel Oti is military, and we have these natural tendencies around command-and-control style organization, and we need the exact opposite of that.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;45&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to the name, the team chose a hashtag for its project that is a nod to both agile software development, and the fact that Kessel Run’s culture is more startup than strictly military: #agileAF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The AF stands for Air Force,” Furtado assured me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unraveling the red tape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By the time the tanker planning tool went into operation, Northrop Grumman was running three years behind schedule on its overhaul of AOC software, and the budget for the project had nearly doubled, from $375 million to $745 million. In a stunning instance of bad timing, Northrop came back to the Air Force for yet more money for the AOC upgrade around the same time JIGSAW went into service. In mid-April—just as the AOC airmen were saying goodbye to their whiteboard—the Air Force issued a “stop work” order to Northrop, halting further work on the contract. By June the contract was cancelled. Northrop declined several requests for comment for this article.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think the Air Force and the Hill both realized that AOC 10.2 was not on a path to deliver anything, which made it pretty easy to let go,” says the DDS’s Price.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Northrop contract envisioned building in security and networking capabilities without necessarily rebuilding the 43 apps that run on top of it, Oti says. The work of the Kessel Run team has begun to encompass that lower-level functionality, as they begin to build out an event-driven architecture to let development teams access a classified database and securely distribute information to thousands of troops.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kessel Run is budgeted at only $68 million for fiscal 2018, according to Sanders. (Raytheon, another big defense contractor, won a $375 million contract last April to maintain AOC software over the long term, and is also working alongside Kessel Run engineers.) More money will likely be leveraged on Kessel Run’s behalf this year in the form of contracting instruments from DIUx and other sources.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;51&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When the project started, Sanders and Oti had their engineers look over the code that Northrop had delivered, but in the end they found they weren’t able to incorporate any of it into the new system. “Just because you followed the software requirements spec doesn’t mean you met the capability need,” Kroger said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There’s a lot of fault to go around on all of this, and we’re not sitting here trying to say the defense industrial base can’t write good software,” Oti said. “The requirements process that we are forcing on them, they’re forced to build to what we asked them for, even if they know it’s not the right thing.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The notable thing about the decision to start working on low-level code—and about all of the team’s decisions—is that it was made on the fly, based on real-time conversations about users’ needs. That’s nothing more than best practices for modern software development, but at the DoD, such agility would normally be impossible. Specifications commonly take years to write and then more years to deliver on before code can even be tested in the field—often making systems obsolete by the time they’re delivered. “The DoD violates pretty much every rule in modern product development,” Schmidt told U.S. Congress recently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Air Force coders in Boston aim to change that. “Kessel Run is not just about building applications,” Oti adds. “We within the DoD need to relook at how we do requirements. We have to be able to take these technical requirements decisions and move them down to that product level, versus at the acquisitions level.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like software engineers, acquisition executives need the “psychological safety” that would support a break from the risk-averse DoD culture that has them tangled in red tape. “There’s plenty of additional things that can be done, even without new authorities being granted,” Schmidt said. “But there’s got to be cultural safety associated with doing that.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;The tip of the spear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Former Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told me Kessel Run is “a perfect example of what I wanted from the Defense Innovation Board.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;44&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s interesting for the history books that our contribution was observation,” says Eric Schmidt. “And then we left, and somebody else did the work.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kessel Run is providing a model for change, but it remains to be seen how broadly that model can be adopted. The Life Cycle Management Center has started trying to shift a number of other projects toward “a model of what we would call common-sense software development,” the DDS’s Price says, and other “centers of innovation” have sprung up to generate ideas. But big projects in which requirements decisions are made at the “product level” remain hard to find.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The most effective way to broaden change is to “set the right example, and don’t try to do everybody’s work for them,” according to former Carter. “This isn’t the kind of thing that it’s useful to make people do.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But leading by example may not be enough. “We believe that technical people need to be in the room making technical decisions in places of authority,” says DDS director Chris Lynch. “Anything less than that will end up placing us back into the results we have right now.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Hopefully, we’re just the tip of the spear,” says Sanders, “and the Department of Defense relooks at how we do requirements, budgeting, and the acquisition process for both software and hardware systems.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kessel Run grew out of a moment of crisis and serendipity—and of war. Of the ability to move fast and rapidly iterate, AFCENT chief of staff Drowley said, “We’ve been granted those authorities because we’re a combatant command right now that’s in wartime operations.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;24&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But it shouldn’t be necessary for us to rethink the Pentagon’s business practices in the midst of a war, just so we can get our fighting forces a UI that works—never mind a state-of-the-art fighter jet. I asked members of the Defense Innovation Board whether they thought it would be possible to create a military machine that could maintain an innovative edge in times of peace as well as war, and got a curious response.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It hasn’t been peacetime in a long time,” I was told.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But as one board member said on learning that the AOC software couldn’t just be fixed: that can’t be the right answer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mark Wallace (@markwallace) has written for the&lt;/em&gt; New York Times Magazine, New York, Wired, &lt;em&gt;and many others. He lives in San Francisco.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>California law requires businesses to let you cancel your subscription online</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/07/thanks-to-california-a-news-site-or-other-business-now-has-to-let-you-cancel-your-subscription-online/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s a script you’re surely familiar with if you’ve ever tried to cancel a subscription to, well, anything:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;25.5&quot;&gt;FADE IN:
&lt;p&gt;INT. LIVING ROOM – DAY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a couch sits CUSTOMER, alcoholic beverage in one hand, smartphone in the other pressed to her ear. CUSTOMER looks steely, resolute, and frustrated, all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CUSTOMER&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi. I’d like to cancel my subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screen splits and on the right, wearing a Bluetooth headset, is CUSTOMER SERVICE REP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CUSTOMER SERVICE REP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry to hear you’ve been charged again and want to cancel. Are you &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; you want to cancel? How about we give you another free week? No? How about we give you another free two weeks? Still no?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The connection drops; CUSTOMER SERVICE REP ghosts. The split screen wipes right, and we dolly in to a tight shot of CUSTOMER, eyes glazed, slowly taking a big gulp of her drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A version of this exchange happened when I tried to cancel my &lt;a href=&quot;https://classpass.com/&quot;&gt;ClassPass&lt;/a&gt; account. A similar version happened when I tried to cancel my Boston Globe a few years ago when it kept being delivered to the wrong address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have our own subscription auto-renewal and cancellation grievances. (My colleague Laura collected &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/laurahazardowen/status/1002281414929403904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;a bunch of news organization-related ones&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;9.6404494382022&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Me: *tries to cancel &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nytimes?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@nytimes&lt;/a&gt; subscription on 27 January*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NYT, just over *4 months later*: oops&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🤦🏻‍♂️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/FOe3iFzm0n&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/FOe3iFzm0n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— dan hon (@hondanhon) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hondanhon/status/1002763516800065536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 2, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;13.458064516129&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Had to call NYT to cancel digital sub. Spent 15 min on hold. First rep tried to retain per training, but when I told him I had meeting to get back to, just cancel it — he hung up on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had to call back later that day, hold for another 15 mins to *finally* get it done&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Cory Brown (@tcb) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tcb/status/1002299273810268160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 31, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a &lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB313&quot;&gt;California law that went into effect July 1&lt;/a&gt; aims to stop companies from blockading customers looking to cancel their services — along with the practice of sneakily sliding them into another month’s subscription without much clarity on the real, full cost of the service. Among the changes: It bans companies from forcing you to, say, call a hard-to-find telephone number to cancel a subscription that you purchased online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;11.566265060241&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I moved &amp;amp; updated address. No papers came; I marked them undelivered. Eventually the courier called me, irate, accused me of taking $ out of his pocket. He'd been delivering to old address. I attempted to update address again – still no papers. Finally had to cxl home delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Tiffany Hamilton (@feathersandwax) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/feathersandwax/status/1002284209631846401?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 31, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB313&quot;&gt;Senate Bill No. 313&lt;/a&gt;, which adds further protections for consumers to an existing law, would (according to its official legislative summary):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;26&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…commencing on July 1, 2018, require a business that makes an automatic renewal offer or continuous service offer that includes a free gift or trial, to include in the offer a clear and conspicuous explanation of the price that will be charged after the trial ends or the manner in which the subscription or purchasing agreement pricing will change upon conclusion of the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill would prohibit a business from charging a consumer’s credit or debit card, or the consumer’s account with a 3rd party, for an automatic renewal or continuous service that is made at a promotional or discounted price for a limited period of time without first obtaining the consumer’s consent to the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill would also specify that if the automatic service offer or continuous service offer includes a free gift or trial, the business is required to disclose how to cancel, and allow the consumer to cancel, the automatic renewal or continuous service before the consumer pays for the goods or services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while it’s just a California law, it also applies to any company (or publisher) with paying customers in the state — so, pretty much everybody, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/25/gdpr-us-based-news-websites-eu-internet-users-la-times&quot;&gt;GDPR-style&lt;/a&gt;. (Credit/blame &lt;a href=&quot;http://sd18.senate.ca.gov/news/2132017-hertzberg-unveils-legislation-protect-consumers-automatic-service-renewals&quot;&gt;State Sen. Bob Hertzberg&lt;/a&gt;, the bill’s sponsor, for the new rules.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rnakashi&quot;&gt;Ryan Nakashima&lt;/a&gt;, an AP technology writer who’s been &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@rnakashi/how-best-to-handle-ad-blocking-subscribers-raise-prices-1421b7b770a8&quot;&gt;conducting some adblocking and subscriptions research&lt;/a&gt; at the Bay Area News Group in California, mentioned to me that in an exit survey of people who were canceling their subscriptions, some cancelers had also called out the cancellation process itself. These are real complaints that the new bill will try to address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text of the bill also notes that “a consumer who accepts an automatic renewal or continuous service offer online shall be &lt;strong&gt;allowed to terminate the automatic renewal or continuous service exclusively online&lt;/strong&gt;, which may include a termination email formatted and provided by the business that a consumer can send to the business without additional information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;8.4130434782609&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Tried to cancel my print subscription to a Gannett paper. There was no apparent way to do it online. You HAVE to call and talk to person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Jonathan Groves (@grovesprof) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/grovesprof/status/1002281759952850948?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 31, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached out to some of the major subscription news organizations in California before July 1 to see what progress they’d made on getting compliant, what sorts of reasons for cancellation they’ve seen from readers, and whether they would have made any of these pricing-transparency and subscription-mechanism improvements had there been no law. I got a lot of basic, affirmative statements. (Many other companies I reached out to declined to comment, citing upcoming vacations.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Assuring customer satisfaction is always top of mind to McClatchy and its newspapers. We are aware and in compliance to new requirements for automatic renewal offers (‘auto-renewals’) per the California law,” read an emailed statement attributed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-schaub-75251414&quot;&gt;Dan Schaub&lt;/a&gt;, corporate director of audience development at McClatchy, passed along via a PR person. McClatchy owns California papers such as the Sacramento, Fresno, and Modesto Bees. “McClatchy adheres to all laws and regulations, and we have taken steps to allow our customers to access their account information easily on all of our websites.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are indeed updating our system and customer service pages to conform with the regulations by ensuring that online subscribers can cancel online, as I imagine all publishers are,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chaseneil&quot;&gt;Neil Chase&lt;/a&gt;, executive editor of the Bay Area News Group, wrote me in an email. The San Jose Mercury News, East Bay Times, and Marin Independent Journal are part of BANG, which falls under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_First_Media&quot;&gt;infamous Digital First Media&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our subscriptions are currently managed through the centralized team at Tribune Interactive/tronc,” a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Times wrote in an email. “We are indeed making changes to our systems to accommodate this new law. Of course it impacts the L.A. Times/San Diego most, but it also impacts California-based subscribers to any publication.” (I tried to follow up for details with a Tribune Interactive/Tronc spokesperson, who punted right away with a reply: “We are not going to comment on a paper we don’t own.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the new rules should make it easier for a customer to cancel a subscription, lots of publishers still have work to do to make it &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/brianboyer/status/961026489327210498&quot;&gt;easier for people to subscribe in the first place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Real-World WebAssembly Benchmark</title>
<link>https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2018/a-real-world-webassembly-benchmark/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2018/a-real-world-webassembly-benchmark/</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://pspdfkit.com/images/blog/2018/webassembly-benchmark/article-header.png&quot; alt=&quot;A Real-World WebAssembly Benchmark&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;PSPDFKit’s mission is to provide the best way to view, annotate, and fill out forms in PDF documents on any platform. In late 2016, we released the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2016/pspdfkit-for-web/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;first version&lt;/a&gt; of our Web SDK, which relies on a server component to render documents. Only a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2017/pspdfkit-web-2017-5/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;few months later&lt;/a&gt;, we released an updated version of PSPDFKit for Web — one that doesn’t require a server component and instead uses WebAssembly (Wasm, WA) to render documents directly in the browser. This was a big achievement for us as a company, and being able to provide a browser-only solution that doesn’t require any backend infrastructure lowers the barrier to entry for our customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rendering PDF documents is a complex task: The format is 25 years old and has many edge cases. It wouldn’t be feasible for us to rewrite the equivalent of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2016/a-pragmatic-approach-to-cross-platform/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;500,000 lines of C++ code&lt;/a&gt; to JavaScript, but technologies such as WebAssembly and asm.js allow us to use the same codebase in a browser, delivering a consistent level of high-fidelity rendering and parsing of PDF documents everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance of the WebAssembly code has been a focus for us since day one, and it’s amazing to see the entire industry move toward a shared goal: making WebAssembly fast. This starts with &lt;a href=&quot;https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2018/optimize-webassembly-startup-performance/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;optimizing WebAssembly startup time&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/compiling/WebAssembly.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;compiler improvements&lt;/a&gt;, and continuous browser upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;anchorable&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;a-real-world-webassembly-benchmark-4c83b1&quot;/&gt;A Real-World WebAssembly Benchmark&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of our goal to make WebAssembly faster, we created a WebAssembly benchmark, which offers browser vendors a real-world, open source benchmark for WebAssembly based on PSPDFKit for Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PSPDFKit-labs/pspdfkit-webassembly-benchmark&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and works with both customer and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pspdfkit.com/try/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;trial licenses&lt;/a&gt;. Browser vendors can &lt;a href=&quot;https://pspdfkit.com/support/request/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;reach out to us&lt;/a&gt; and obtain a more permissive license key so that the benchmark can run on different machines and even on their continuous integration servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benchmark is a simple JavaScript application that runs in the browser. Using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/performance-timeline/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;Web Performance API&lt;/a&gt;, we measure the time of various standard actions on a PDF document. We group individual results into two different buckets: loading time (compilation and instantiation) and run time, because we see compile times as the biggest differentiators when looking at different browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;anchorable&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;considerations-12edb7&quot;/&gt;Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive right into analyzing our results, we want to share more details about our test setup. One thing we’re trying to accomplish with this benchmark is to have a score we can use to improve the performance of PSPDFKit for Web instead of creating a microbenchmark. As such, the benchmark does not call directly into WebAssembly; rather, it also tests the bridge we use to communicate with it — an important part of PSPDFKit for Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we had to disable one of the major improvements to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2018/optimize-webassembly-startup-performance/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;WebAssembly startup time&lt;/a&gt;: streaming compilation. This makes it harder to compare between the WebAssembly results and our JavaScript-fallback&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; results, as the latter can’t use this optimization. We want a score that can easily be compared across a wide variety of browsers, and to make this possible, we had to remove the network speed noise from the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our WebAssembly payload is also rather unusual. Much of the size of our WebAssembly artifact is attributed to special cases in the PDF spec that might not be executed for every document. We want our PDF viewer to deliver the best results no matter the device. This is a factor where asm.js excels, as it only needs to compile functions when they are actually run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;anchorable&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;results-edaee1&quot;/&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://pspdfkit.com/images/blog/2018/webassembly-benchmark/results-macOS.png&quot; width=&quot;712&quot; alt=&quot;PSPDFKit WebAssembly Score on macOS: Chrome 67.0.3396.99 (64-bit): 5408, Chrome 69.0.3481.0 canary (64-bit, new baseline compiler): 4325, Firefox 61.0 (64-bit): 1902, Safari 11.1.1 (13605.2.8): 8382&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were a bit surprising at first. While WebAssembly is making great progress, when we compare WebAssembly with our JavaScript fallback for the same product and tasks, all browsers except Firefox are still slower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://pspdfkit.com/images/blog/2018/webassembly-benchmark/results-windows.png&quot; width=&quot;712&quot; alt=&quot;PSPDFKit WebAssembly Score on Windows: Chrome 67.0.3396.99 (64-bit): 3129, Chrome 69.0.3481.0 canary (64-bit, new baseline compiler): 2556, Firefox 61.0 (64-bit): 1300, Edge 42.17134.1.0 11362: 7315&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;After collecting the first results from our benchmarks, we reached out to the individual browser vendors to discuss these results and investigate ways to further improve the numbers. At this point, we want to thank Google, Mozilla, Microsoft, and Apple — all browser vendors were exceptionally helpful along the way and provided valuable feedback to help improve our benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;anchorable&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;chrome-001626&quot;/&gt;Chrome&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Runtime performance of WebAssembly has always been great when using Google Chrome. We were only a bit disappointed to find out that the v8 team &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=719172&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;abandoned&lt;/a&gt; the plan to implement IndexedDB caching for WebAssembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, after Google invited us to a call and shared some of the company’s upcoming plans, we’re excited about what’s in store. The biggest change in the near future will be the introduction of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/v8-reviews/iojQgRVx25Y%5B1-25%5D&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;new baseline WebAssembly compiler&lt;/a&gt;. You can already try this compiler today by running the latest canary build and enabling the &lt;a href=&quot;chrome://flags/#enable-webassembly-baseline&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;enable-webassembly-baseline&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; flag. In our internal tests, we’ve noticed significant improvements in the total startup time. We couldn’t be happier to see this compiler being enabled by default, starting with the next canary version (M69).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the team gave us a sneak peek at the upcoming alternatives for caching the compiled WebAssembly module so that you don’t have to recompile on every browser refresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;anchorable&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;firefox-baa835&quot;/&gt;Firefox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox delivered the best results in our benchmark, no doubt due to the release of &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/01/making-webassembly-even-faster-firefoxs-new-streaming-and-tiering-compiler/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;tiered compilation&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2018/optimize-webassembly-startup-performance/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;IndexedDB caching&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team was especially helpful in pointing out bottlenecks in our JavaScript implementation, and we’re already incorporating these changes into our next PSPDFKit for Web release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also pointed out that after a very fast initial compilation, browsers that use a baseline compiler kick off a slower, more optimizing compilation in the background which continues to execute while we run other benchmarks. For this reason we now benchmark initialization at the end to reduce the amount of background interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;anchorable&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;edge-4f8748&quot;/&gt;Edge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance of Edge is underwhelming. But with recent optimizations like &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2018/06/19/improved-javascript-webassembly-performance-edgehtml-17/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;inlining for WebAssembly&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft Edge proves that the company is fully committed to making WebAssembly faster in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft told us that the company is currently working on making WebAssembly easier to produce, consume, and extend. In the future, Microsoft wants to bring more features — which are currently not possible in asm.js (or JavaScript) — to WebAssembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Edge, we made sure our JavaScript fallback also runs (just like our SDK) on Internet Explorer 11. If you want to try it out, make sure to have a coffee ready, as the performance will be quite a bit slower (in our tests, it was 6.5x slower).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;anchorable&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;safari-6db021&quot;/&gt;Safari&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve found that Apple’s Safari’s performance is especially bad on beta versions of macOS, and we worked with Apple’s engineers to track down &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=187196&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;a recent regression (Bug 187196)&lt;/a&gt; where trace points turned out to be the expensive factor. Apple has also been exceptionally awesome in reacting to this bug, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/233378/webkit&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;the fix has already landed in master&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;anchorable&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;conclusion-d0d880&quot;/&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this blog post, we want to say &lt;em&gt;thank you&lt;/em&gt; ❤️ to all the browser vendors for their efforts to make WebAssembly fast and successful. We also want to communicate that our door is always open and we are here to collaborate with you to make our product and the web platform better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like this article, be sure to also check out our others: &lt;a href=&quot;https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2017/webassembly-a-new-hope/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;WebAssembly: A New Hope&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://pspdfkit.com/blog/2018/optimize-webassembly-startup-performance/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;Optimizing WebAssembly Startup Time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether or not you’re a browser vendor, please try out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://iswebassemblyfastyet.com&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;WebAssembly Benchmark&lt;/a&gt; and feel free to reach out in case you have any feedback. We have an official &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PSPDFKit&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;, and you can also find us on our personal accounts (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/giuseppegurgone&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;@giuseppegurgone&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PhilippSpiess&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;@PhilippSpiess&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; JavaScript fallback refers to our asm.js build with &lt;a href=&quot;https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/optimizing/Optimizing-Code.html#memory-growth&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Because of the dynamic nature of PDFs, some of them might need a lot more memory than others. Our internal tests have shown that this option works best in our use case.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Advice</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://patrickcollison.com/advice</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Every now and again, someone emails me and asks for very general advice. (&quot;How do I change the world?&quot;) With the caveat that I've only lived a fraction of one life, and am still trying to figure things out, here's the advice I'd give past me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you're 10–20:&lt;/strong&gt; These are prime years!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Go deep on things. Become an expert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In particular, try to go deep on &lt;em&gt;multiple&lt;/em&gt; things. (To varying degrees, I tried to go deep on languages, programming, writing, physics, math. Some of those stuck more than others.) One of the main things you should try to achieve by age 20 is some sense for which kinds of things you &lt;em&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt; doing. This probably won't change a lot throughout your life and so you should try to discover the shape of that space as quickly as you can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't stress out too much about how valuable the things you're going deep on are... but don't ignore it either. It should be a factor you weigh but not by itself dispositive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To the extent that you enjoy working hard, do. Subject to that constraint, it's not clear that the returns to effort ever diminish substantially. If you're lucky enough to enjoy it a lot, be grateful and take full advantage!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make friends over the internet with people who are great at things you're interested in. The internet is one of the biggest advantages you have over prior generations. Leverage it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aim to read a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you think something is important but people older than you hold don't hold it in high regard, there's a decent chance that you're right and they're wrong. Status lags by a generation or more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Above all else, don't make the mistake of judging your success based on your current peer group. By all means make friends but being weird as a teenager is generally good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;But&lt;/em&gt; having good social skills confers life-long benefits. So, don't write them off. Get good at making a good first impression, being funny (if possible... this author still working on it...), speaking publicly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make things. Operating in a space with a lot of uncertainty is a very different experience to learning something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More broadly, nobody is going to teach you to think for yourself. A large fraction of what people around you believe is mistaken. Internalize this and practice coming up with your own worldview. The correlation between it and those around you shouldn't be too strong unless you think you were especially lucky in your initial conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're in the US and go to a good school, there are a lot of forces that will push you towards following traintracks laid by others rather than charting a course yourself. Make sure that the things you're pursuing are weird things that &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; want to pursue, not whatever the standard path is. Heuristic: do your friends at school think your path is a bit strange? If not, maybe it's too normal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out a way to travel to San Francisco and to meet other people who've moved there to pursue their dreams. Why San Francisco? San Francisco is the Schelling point for high-&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits#Openness_to_experience&quot;&gt;openness&lt;/a&gt;, smart, energetic, optimistic people. Global Weird HQ. Take advantage of opportunities to travel to other places too, of course.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who did great things often did so at very surprisingly young ages. (They were grayhaired when they became famous... not when they did the work.) So, hurry up! You can do great things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you're 20–30:&lt;/strong&gt; I'm not yet old enough to write this section. Check back in some years.&lt;/p&gt;

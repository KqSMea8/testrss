<title>When CEOs’ Equity Is About to Vest, They Cut Investment to Boost the Stock Price</title>

&lt;h4 class=&quot;text-gray-light mbn mt-large2&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does short-termism exist? And, if it does, what’s the underlying cause? A new study finds that the more equity CEOs have vesting in a given quarter, the more they cut investment. Vesting equity encourages CEOs to take actions with destructive long-term consequences. The research suggests that the horizon&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;of pay is more important than the total value. It affects the CEO’s incentives to invest, with major implications for the company’s long-run success and contribution to society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;125.62921931799&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mbn pbn&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-195825&quot; src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-28-896845746-miragec.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-28-896845746-miragec-300x169.jpg 300w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-28-896845746-miragec-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-28-896845746-miragec-500x281.jpg 500w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-28-896845746-miragec-383x215.jpg 383w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-28-896845746-miragec-383x215.jpg 383w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-28-896845746-miragec-500x281.jpg 500w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-28-896845746-miragec-700x394.jpg 700w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-28-896845746-miragec-850x478.jpg 850w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-28-896845746-miragec-1200x675.jpg 1200w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-28-896845746-miragec.jpg 1200w&quot; alt=&quot;feb18-28-896845746-miragec&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;675&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 48em) 55.7291667vw, 97.3924381vw&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;miragec/Getty Images&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are today’s businesses plagued by short-termism? The narrative is compelling. Executives cut investment to hit short-term earnings targets and trigger bonus payouts, the argument goes. They are egged on by short-term shareholders, who care only about making a quick buck, rather than growing the company for the long term. Moreover, long-term investments — such as reducing carbon emissions, developing blockbuster drugs, or training workers — benefit more than just shareholders. So, the charge that businesses are deprioritizing them leads to concerns that business no longer serves society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite how common the charge of short-termism has become, rigorous evidence of short-termism is surprisingly difficult to find. &lt;a href=&quot;https://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charvey/Research/Published_Papers/P89_The_economic_implications.pdf&quot;&gt;Eighty percent of CFOs&lt;/a&gt; say that they’d cut investment to meet earnings targets — but what they say isn’t necessarily what they do. A recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2017/02/finally-proof-that-managing-for-the-long-term-pays-off&quot;&gt;McKinsey study&lt;/a&gt; found that a “long-termism” index (including how much a firm invests) is correlated with future long-term stock returns, suggesting that long-termism pays off. But causality could easily run the other way. When a firm’s long-term outlook is worse, it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; invest less. This is taught in any Finance 101 class, and is presumably what McKinsey advises its clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So does short-termism exist? And if it does, what’s the underlying cause?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what Vivian Fang, Katharina Lewellen, and I set out to study. We wanted to see whether CEO pay packets encouraged short-termism — whether CEOs cut investment to pump up their company’s short-term stock price and then cash out their shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s extremely hard to document causation rather than simply correlation. Say we found that a CEO cuts investment and then sells their shares. One interpretation is that they cut investment to cash out. But another is that their firm’s long-term outlook is poor. This causes the CEO (correctly) to cut investment and also (rationally) to sell their shares. So, there’s correlation between investment and sales, but no causation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We studied not how many shares the CEO sells, but how many shares are scheduled to vest. Here’s the idea: CEOs’ shares come with a vesting or lock-up period. Only once this period is over can they sell — and they typically do, to diversify their personal investments. So, when the lock-up expires, the CEO is concerned about the stock price. But a lock-up expiring today is driven by the board’s decision several years ago to grant the shares. It’s unlikely that at the time the board would have known the firm’s present outlook. So the decision to grant shares back then, and thus the fact that shares are vesting today, is unlikely to be driven by factors that also determine investment. By focusing on when shares vest rather than when CEOs sell shares, we’re able to show causation — not just correlation — from CEOs’ personal wealth concerns to cuts in investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/30/7/2229/3058111/Equity-Vesting-and-Investment?guestAccessKey=50562c72-0c1c-4976-93a1-ab1b83f5a802&quot;&gt;find&lt;/a&gt; that the more equity CEOs have vesting in a given quarter, the more they cut investment. This result holds for five different measures of investment and for both vesting stock and vesting options. In addition, vesting equity is positively correlated with the CEO just barely meeting analyst earnings forecasts — suggesting that it causes the CEO to focus on short-term earnings rather than long-term investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That result is consistent with short-term behavior, but we considered an alternative interpretation. Could the investment cuts actually be efficient? Perhaps stock price concerns are motivating, because they induce the CEO to make tough decisions, such as cutting wasteful investment. If so, we would expect the CEO to improve efficiency in other ways as well, such as increasing sales growth or cutting other expenses. And we find no evidence of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, in a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3037354&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; with Vivian and Allen Huang, we aim to more precisely document the long-term consequences of short-term incentives. To do so, we study share buybacks and M&amp;amp;A, since — unlike with investment cuts — we can measure the long-term returns to these actions as they have a clear announcement date. We find that the more vesting equity the CEO has in a given quarter, the higher the likelihood is of both buybacks and M&amp;amp;A. Like investment cuts, buybacks and M&amp;amp;A could be &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2017/09/the-case-for-stock-buybacks&quot;&gt;good&lt;/a&gt; rather than bad — but we find that vesting equity leads to the bad type. It is associated with higher short-term returns to both decisions, but significantly lower long-term returns. In short, vesting equity encourages CEOs to take actions with destructive long-term consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this all mean for CEO pay? There is widespread belief that CEO pay needs to be reformed, but proposed reforms typically focus on the &lt;em&gt;level&lt;/em&gt; of pay. Our research suggests that the &lt;em&gt;horizon &lt;/em&gt;of pay is more important — it affects the CEO’s incentives to invest, with major implications for the company’s long-run success and contribution to society. Cutting pay in half will win more headlines than extending the vesting horizon from, say, three to five years, but the latter is likely to be much more important. Indeed, the UK government’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/584013/corporate-governance-reform-green-paper.pdf&quot;&gt;green paper on corporate governance&lt;/a&gt; has proposed this extension, and the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbim.no/contentassets/bc85c448e6b24ff5a31088883695a344/ceo-remuneration---amp-1-17---norges-bank-investment-management.pdf&quot;&gt;remuneration principles&lt;/a&gt; advocates making the CEO a long-term shareholder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cutting the level of CEO pay aims to redistribute the CEO’s share of the pie to other stakeholders. But since the CEO’s slice is small to begin with — in large U.S. firms, it accounts for just 0.05% of firm value — the result would be negligible. Increasing the horizon of pay will encourage the CEO to invest for the firm’s long-term success, growing the pie to the benefit of both shareholders and society.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Governments have overestimated the economic returns of higher education</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;AUTOMATION and globalisation have brought drastic changes to Western labour markets. Middle-skilled jobs are disappearing fast. In America, wages for blue-collar workers have been largely stagnant since the 1970s, whereas those for university graduates have soared. Silicon Valley types frequently warn that advances in technology, especially in artificial intelligence, will be devastating for low-skilled workers. One prominent study, by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne of Oxford University, estimated that 47% of jobs in America could be automated over the next two decades. The spectre of mass unemployment, along with increasing levels of income equality, has led many policymakers to see investment in university as crucial for economic prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments have plenty of reason to be bullish about higher education. Perhaps the best piece of evidence they have of the wisdom of investing more in universities is the graduate-wage premium—the difference in wages between those with university degrees and those without. In their book “The Race between Education and Technology”, Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz of Harvard University point out that this premium fell during the first half of the 20th century in America as universities expanded enrolment, but started rising sharply around 1980. Although the premium has started to level off in recent years, the fact that university graduates still make around 70% more than non-graduates suggests that demand for skilled workers still far exceeds supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet governments may actually be overestimating the economic benefits of higher education. While universities are places of learning, they are also social sorting mechanisms. Part of the reason why university graduates earn more is because they are brighter and harder-working to begin with. Some professionals, such as doctors or engineers, do require an extensive amount of technical training, but many do not. The fact that humanities graduates, whose courses often have little to do with their subsequent work, tend to earn more if they come from more prestigious institutions suggests that one reason for going to university is to get ahead of peers in the job market. Bryan Caplan, an economist at George Mason University, argues that earning a degree is like “standing up at a concert”. Doing so improves your view of the show, but it comes at a cost to those sitting behind you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, 43% of adults aged 25-34 now have tertiary degrees, up from 23% in 1995. Yet it is not clear to what extent these degrees have translated into economic gains. An analysis by &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt; of American labour-market data finds that since 1970 the share of workers with degrees has increased in virtually every occupation. But in around half of occupations with better-educated workers average wages have still fallen in real terms. The ubiquity of the degree means that for many workers going to university is more of an obligation than a choice. Moreover, university does not suit all learners. Estimates of the economic returns to higher education tend to assume that all students will graduate. In practice, around 30% of students in Europe and 40% of students in America will drop out before earning their degrees. This means that the expected economic returns of a university education for average students are far lower than commonly understood. Governments are right to fret about training future workers, but they should look beyond just universities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of Uber and Lyft drivers are earning less than minimum wage and almost a third of them are actually losing money by driving, according to researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ceepr.mit.edu/files/papers/2018-005-Brief.pdf&quot;&gt;A working paper&lt;/a&gt; by Stephen M. Zoepf, Stella Chen, Paa Adu and Gonzalo Pozo at MIT's Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research says the median pretax profit earned from driving is $3.37 per hour after taking expenses into account. Seventy-four percent of drivers earn less than their state's minimum wage, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty percent of drivers &quot;are actually losing money once vehicle expenses are included,&quot; the authors found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res590169377&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage531642304&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2017/06/09/531642304/the-faceless-boss-a-look-into-the-uber-driver-workplace&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/alltechconsidered\/2017\/06\/09\/531642304\/the-faceless-boss-a-look-into-the-uber-driver-workplace&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/06/08/06062017_reninger_uber_npr_1317-edit_sq-9763349e731c1df64574ca31d432444e3152caa3-s100-c15.jpg&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/06/08/06062017_reninger_uber_npr_1317-edit_sq-9763349e731c1df64574ca31d432444e3152caa3-s100.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;The Faceless Boss: A Look Into The Uber Driver Workplace&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusions are based on surveys of more than 1,100 drivers who told researchers about their revenue, how many miles they drove and what type of car they used. The study's authors then combined that with typical costs associated with a certain car's insurance, maintenance, gas and depreciation, which was gathered in data from Edmunds, Kelley Blue Book and the Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drivers earning the median amount of revenue are getting $0.59 per mile driven, researchers say, but expenses work out to $0.30 per mile, meaning a driver makes a median profit of $0.29 for each mile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Uber spokesperson responded to the finding in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/01/uber-lyft-driver-wages-median-report&quot;&gt;statement to The Guardian:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;edTag&quot; readability=&quot;5.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;While the paper is certainly attention grabbing, its methodology and findings are deeply flawed. We've reached out to the paper's authors to share our concerns and suggest ways we might work together to refine their approach.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newspaper also noted, &quot;Other &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.stanford.edu/~diamondr/UberPayGap.pdf&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://therideshareguy.com/2018-uber-and-lyft-driver-survey-results-the-rideshare-guy/&quot;&gt;surveys&lt;/a&gt; have found higher hourly earnings for Uber drivers, in part because there are numerous ways to report income and to calculate costs and time and miles spent on the job.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT authors also calculated that it's possible for billions of dollars in driver profits to be untaxed because &quot;nearly half of drivers can declare a loss on their taxes.&quot; Drivers are able to use the IRS standard mileage rate deduction to write off some of the costs of using a car for business. In 2016, that number was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irs.gov/tax-professionals/standard-mileage-rates&quot;&gt;$0.54 per mile.&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Because of this deduction, most ride-hailing drivers are able to declare profits that are substantially lower,&quot; researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If drivers are fully able to capitalize on these losses for tax purposes, 73.5% of an estimated U.S. market $4.8B in annual ride-hailing driver profit is untaxed,&quot; they add.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage579980199&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2018/02/02/579980199/when-a-full-time-job-isnt-enough-to-make-it&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2018\/02\/02\/579980199\/when-a-full-time-job-isnt-enough-to-make-it&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/02/02/gettyimages-106683226-edit_sq-56acb5cf99123b4ff72d9c559f6072cee4d3f774-s100-c15.jpg&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/02/02/gettyimages-106683226-edit_sq-56acb5cf99123b4ff72d9c559f6072cee4d3f774-s100.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;When A Full-Time Job Isn't Enough To Make It&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to MIT researchers, 80 percent of drivers said they work less than 40 hours per week. An NPR/Marist poll in January found that 1 in 5 jobs in the U.S. is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/series/579833363/the-rise-of-the-contract-workers&quot;&gt;held by a contract worker;&lt;/a&gt; contractors often juggle multiple part-time jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber and Lyft both have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2017/12/11/569462645/in-effort-to-court-drivers-lyft-offering-education-discounts&quot;&gt;&quot;notoriously high&quot;&lt;/a&gt; turnover rates among drivers. A report last year said just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/20/only-4-percent-of-uber-drivers-remain-after-a-year-says-report.html&quot;&gt;4 percent&lt;/a&gt; of Uber drivers work for the company for at least a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NPR's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2017/12/11/569462645/in-effort-to-court-drivers-lyft-offering-education-discounts&quot;&gt;Aarti Shahani reported&lt;/a&gt; in December that Lyft began a program to give drivers &quot;access to discounted GED and college courses online&quot; in a recruiting effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was only last year that Uber introduced the option to tip drivers into its app for customers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2017/10/7/16363448/uber-lyft-driver-features-app&quot;&gt;Recode listed&lt;/a&gt; the initiatives Uber rolled out in 2017 in order to appeal to drivers, including 24-hour phone support, paid wait time and paying drivers if customers cancel after a certain amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Uber and Lyft have been fighting legal battles for years against initiatives to classify their drivers as &quot;employees&quot; instead of &quot;independent contractors&quot; — meaning drivers don't receive benefits like health care or sick leave.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Go best practices, six years in (2016)</title>
<link>https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;This article was originally a talk at QCon London 2016. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infoq.com/presentations/go-patterns&quot;&gt;Video and slides here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, I gave a talk at the inaugural GopherCon titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-in-production&quot;&gt;Best Practices in Production Environments&lt;/a&gt;. We were early adopters at &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com&quot;&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt;, and by that point had been writing, running, and maintaining Go in production in one form or another for nearly 2 years. We had learned a few things, and I tried to distill and convey some of those lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I’ve continued working in Go full-time, later on the activities and infrastructure teams at SoundCloud, and now at &lt;a href=&quot;https://weave.works&quot;&gt;Weaveworks&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=&quot;https://weave.works/products/weave-scope&quot;&gt;Weave Scope&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/weaveworks/mesh&quot;&gt;Weave Mesh&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve also been working hard on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/go-kit/kit&quot;&gt;Go kit&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source toolkit for microservices. And all the while, I’ve been active in the Go community, meeting lots of developers at meetups and conferences throughout Europe and the US, and collecting their stories—both successes and failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.golang.org/6years&quot;&gt;6th anniversary&lt;/a&gt; of Go’s release in November of 2015, I thought back to that first talk. Which of those best practices have stood the test of time? Which have become outmoded or counterproductive? Are there any new practices that have emerged? In March, I had the opportunity to give a talk at &lt;a href=&quot;https://qconlondon.com&quot;&gt;QCon London&lt;/a&gt; where I reviewed the best practices from 2014 and took a look at how Go has evolved in 2016. Here’s the meat of that talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve highlighted the key takeaways as linkable Top Tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go has development environment conventions centered around the GOPATH. In 2014 I advocated strongly for a single global GOPATH. My positioned has softened a bit. I still think that’s the best idea, all else equal, but depending on your project or team, other things may make sense, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you or your organization produces primarily binaries, you might find some advantages with a per-project GOPATH. There’s a new tool, &lt;a href=&quot;https://getgb.io&quot;&gt;gb&lt;/a&gt;, from Dave Cheney and contributors, which replaces the standard go tooling for this use-case. A lot of people are reporting a lot of success with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Go developers use a two-entry GOPATH, e.g. &lt;code&gt;$HOME/go/external:$HOME/go/internal&lt;/code&gt;. The go tool has always known how to deal with this: go get will fetch into the first path, so it can be useful if you need strict separation of third-party vs. internal code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I’ve noticed some developers forget to do: put GOPATH/bin into your PATH. This allows you to easily run binaries you get via go get, and makes the (preferred) go install mechanism of building code easier to work with. No reason not to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;toptip&quot; readability=&quot;7.741935483871&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#top-tip-1&quot;&gt;✪&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Top Tip&lt;/strong&gt; — Put $GOPATH/bin in your $PATH, so installed binaries are easily accessible.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding editors and IDEs, there’s been a lot of steady improvement. If you’re a vim warrior, life has never been better: thanks to the tireless and extremely capable efforts of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fatih&quot;&gt;Fatih Arslan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fatih/vim-go&quot;&gt;vim-go&lt;/a&gt; plugin is in an absolutely exceptional state, best-in-class. I’m not as familiar with emacs, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dominikhonnef&quot;&gt;Dominik Honnef’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dominikh/go-mode.el&quot;&gt;go-mode.el&lt;/a&gt; is still the big kahuna there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving up the stack, lots of folks are still using and having success with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sublimetext.com/&quot;&gt;Sublime Text&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DisposaBoy/GoSublime&quot;&gt;GoSublime&lt;/a&gt;. And it’s hard to beat the speed. But more attention seems to be paid lately to the Electron-powered editors. &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/packages/go-plus&quot;&gt;go-plus&lt;/a&gt; has many fans, especially those developers that have to frequently switch languages to JavaScript. The dark horse has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/&quot;&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go&quot;&gt;vscode-go&lt;/a&gt;, which, while slower than Sublime Text, is noticably faster than Atom, and has excellent default support for important-to-me features, like click-to-definition. I’ve been using it daily for about half a year now, after being introduced to it by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tecbot&quot;&gt;Thomas Adam&lt;/a&gt;. Lots of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of full IDEs, the purpose-built &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/visualfc/liteide&quot;&gt;LiteIDE&lt;/a&gt; has been receiving regular updates and certainly has its share of fans. And the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/go-lang-plugin-org/go-lang-idea-plugin&quot;&gt;IntelliJ Go plugin&lt;/a&gt; has been consistently improving as well.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Ben Johnson has written an excellent article titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@benbjohnson/standard-package-layout-7cdbc8391fc1&quot;&gt;Standard Package Layout&lt;/a&gt; with great advice for typical line-of-business applications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Tim Hockin’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thockin/go-build-template&quot;&gt;go-build-template&lt;/a&gt;, adapted slightly, has proven to be a better general model. I’ve adapted this section since its original publication.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve had a lot of time for projects to mature, and some patterns have emerged. While I believe there is no single best repo structure, I think there is a good general model for many types of projects. It’s especially useful for projects that provide both binaries and libraries, or combine Go code with other, non-Go assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic idea is to have two top-level directories, pkg and cmd. Underneath pkg, create directories for each of your libraries. Underneath cmd, create directories for each of your binaries. All of your Go code should live exclusively in one of these locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;github.com/peterbourgon/foo/
  circle.yml
  Dockerfile
  cmd/
    foosrv/
      main.go
    foocli/
      main.go
  pkg/
    fs/
      fs.go
      fs_test.go
      mock.go
      mock_test.go
    merge/
      merge.go
      merge_test.go
    api/
      api.go
      api_test.go
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of your artifacts remain go gettable. The paths may be slightly longer, but the nomenclature is familiar to other Go developers. And you have space and isolation for non-Go assets. For example, Javascript can live in a client or ui subdirectory. Dockerfiles, continuous integration configs, or other build helpers can live in the project root or in a build subdirectory. And runtime configuration like Kubernetes manifests can have a home, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;toptip&quot; readability=&quot;6.7920792079208&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#top-tip-2&quot;&gt;✪&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Top Tip&lt;/strong&gt; — Put library code under a pkg/ subdirectory. Put binaries under a cmd/ subdirectory.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you’ll still use fully-qualified import paths. That is, the main.go in cmd/foosrv should &lt;code&gt;import &quot;github.com/peterbourgon/foo/pkg/fs&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. And beware of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#dependency-management&quot;&gt;ramifications of including a vendor dir&lt;/a&gt; for downstream users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;toptip&quot; readability=&quot;6.7558139534884&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#top-tip-3&quot;&gt;✪&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Top Tip&lt;/strong&gt; — Always use fully-qualified import paths. Never use relative imports.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This little bit of structure makes us play nice in the broader ecosystem, and hopefully continues to ensure our code is easy to consume.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Things have stayed largely the same here. This is one area that Go has gotten quite right, and I really appreciate the consensus in the community and stability in the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments&quot;&gt;Code Review Comments&lt;/a&gt; are great, and should be the minimum set of critera you enforce during code review. And when there are disputes or inconsistencies in names, Andrew Gerrand’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://talks.golang.org/2014/names.slide&quot;&gt;idiomatic naming conventions&lt;/a&gt; are a great set of guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And in terms of tooling, things have only gotten better. You should configure your editor to invoke gofmt—or, better, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bradfitz/goimports&quot;&gt;goimports&lt;/a&gt;—on save. (At this point, I hope that’s not in any way controversial.) The go vet tool produces (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/golang/go/issues/9171&quot;&gt;almost&lt;/a&gt;!) no false positives, so you might consider making it part of your precommit hook. And check out the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter&quot;&gt;gometalinter&lt;/a&gt; for linting concerns. This &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; produce false positives, so it’s not a bad idea to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/weaveworks/mesh/blob/master/lint&quot;&gt;encode your own conventions&lt;/a&gt; somehow.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Configuration is the surface area between the runtime environment and the process. It should be explicit and well-documented. I still use and recommend package flag, but I admit at this point I wish it were less esoteric. I wish it had standard, getopts-style long- and short-form argument syntax, and I wish its usage text were much more compact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://12factor.net&quot;&gt;12-factor apps&lt;/a&gt; encourage you to use environment vars for configuration, and I think that’s fine, &lt;em&gt;provided each var is also defined as a flag&lt;/em&gt;. Explicitness is important: changing the runtime behavior of an application should happen in ways that are discoverable and documented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said it in 2014 but I think it’s important enough to say again: &lt;a href=&quot;https://robots.thoughtbot.com/where-to-define-command-line-flags-in-go&quot;&gt;define and parse your flags in func main&lt;/a&gt;. Only func main has the right to decide the flags that will be available to the user. If your library code wants to parameterize its behavior, those parameters should be part of type constructors. Moving configuration to package globals has the illusion of convenience, but it’s a false economy: doing so breaks code modularity, makes it more difficult for developers or future maintainers to understand dependency relationships, and makes writing independent, parallelizable tests much more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;toptip&quot; readability=&quot;6.7789473684211&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#top-tip-5&quot;&gt;✪&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Top Tip&lt;/strong&gt; — Only func main has the right to decide which flags are available to the user.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there’s a great opportunity for a well-scoped flags package to emerge from the community, combining all of these characteristics. Maybe it already exists; if so, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/peterbourgon&quot;&gt;please let me know&lt;/a&gt;. I’d certainly use it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the talk, I used configuration as a jumping-off point, to discuss a few other issues of program design. (I didn’t cover this in the 2014 version.) To start, let’s take a look at constructors. If we are properly parameterizing all of our dependencies, our constructors can get quite large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;foo, err := newFoo(
    *fooKey,
    bar,
    100 * time.Millisecond,
    nil,
)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer foo.close()
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes this kind of construction is best expressed with a config object: a struct parameter to a constructor that takes &lt;em&gt;optional&lt;/em&gt; parameters to the constructed object. Let’s assume fooKey is a required parameter, and everything else either has a sensible default or is optional. Often, I see projects construct config objects in a sort of piecemeal way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;// Don't do this.
cfg := fooConfig{}
cfg.Bar = bar
cfg.Period = 100 * time.Millisecond
cfg.Output = nil

foo, err := newFoo(*fooKey, cfg)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer foo.close()
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s considerably nicer to leverage so-called struct initialization syntax to construct the object all at once, in a single statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;// This is better.
cfg := fooConfig{
    Bar:    bar,
    Period: 100 * time.Millisecond,
    Output: nil,
}

foo, err := newFoo(*fooKey, cfg)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer foo.close()
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No statements go by where the object is in an intermediate, invalid state. And all of the fields are nicely delimited and indented, mirroring the fooConfig definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice we construct and then immediately use the cfg object. In this case we can save another degree of intermediate state, and another line of code, by inlining the struct declaration into the newFoo constructor directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;// This is even better.
foo, err := newFoo(*fooKey, fooConfig{
    Bar:    bar,
    Period: 100 * time.Millisecond,
    Output: nil,
})
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer foo.close()
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;toptip&quot; readability=&quot;7.8167938931298&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#top-tip-6&quot;&gt;✪&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Top Tip&lt;/strong&gt; — Use struct literal initialization to avoid invalid intermediate state. Inline struct declarations where possible.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s turn to the subject of sensible defaults. Observe that the Output parameter is something that can take a nil value. For the sake of argument, assume it’s an io.Writer. If we don’t do anything special, when we want to use it in our foo object, we’ll have to first perform a nil check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;func (f *foo) process() {
    if f.Output != nil {
        fmt.Fprintf(f.Output, &quot;start\n&quot;)
    }
    // ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not great. It’s much safer, and nicer, to be able to use output without having to check it for existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;func (f *foo) process() {
     fmt.Fprintf(f.Output, &quot;start\n&quot;)
     // ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we should provide a usable default here. With interface types, one good way is to pass something that provides a no-op implementation of the interface. And it turns out that the stdlib ioutil package comes with a no-op io.Writer, called ioutil.Discard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;toptip&quot; readability=&quot;6.695652173913&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#top-tip-7&quot;&gt;✪&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Top Tip&lt;/strong&gt; — Avoid nil checks via default no-op implementations.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could pass that into the fooConfig object, but that’s still fragile. If the caller forgets to do it at the callsite, we’ll still end up with a nil parameter. So, instead, we can create a sort of safety within the constructor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;func newFoo(..., cfg fooConfig) *foo {
    if cfg.Output == nil {
        cfg.Output = ioutil.Discard
    }
    // ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just an application of the Go idiom &lt;em&gt;make the zero value useful&lt;/em&gt;. We allow the zero value of the parameter (nil) to yield good default behavior (no-op).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;toptip&quot; readability=&quot;7.68&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#top-tip-8&quot;&gt;✪&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Top Tip&lt;/strong&gt; — Make the zero value useful, especially in config objects.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s revisit the constructor. The parameters fooKey, bar, period, output are all &lt;em&gt;dependencies&lt;/em&gt;. The foo object &lt;em&gt;depends&lt;/em&gt; on each of them in order to start and run successfully. If there’s a single lesson I’ve learned from writing Go code in the wild and observing large Go projects on a daily basis for the past six years, it is this: &lt;strong&gt;make dependencies explicit&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;toptip bigdeal&quot; readability=&quot;6.5333333333333&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#top-tip-9&quot;&gt;✪&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Top Tip&lt;/strong&gt; — Make dependencies explicit!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An incredible amount of maintenance burden, confusion, bugs, and unpaid technical debt can, I believe, be traced back to ambiguous or implicit dependencies. Consider this method on the type foo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;func (f *foo) process() {
    fmt.Fprintf(f.Output, &quot;start\n&quot;)
    result := f.Bar.compute()
    log.Printf(&quot;bar: %v&quot;, result) // Whoops!
    // ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fmt.Printf is self-contained and doesn’t affect or depend on global state; in functional terms, it has something like &lt;em&gt;referential transparency&lt;/em&gt;. So it is not a dependency. Obviously, f.Bar is a dependency. And, interestingly, log.Printf acts on a package-global logger object, it’s just obscured behind the free function Printf. So it, too, is a dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we do with dependencies? &lt;strong&gt;We make them explicit.&lt;/strong&gt; Because the process method prints to a log as part of its work, either the method or the foo object itself needs to take a logger object as a dependency. For example, log.Printf should become f.Logger.Printf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;func (f *foo) process() {
    fmt.Fprintf(f.Output, &quot;start\n&quot;)
    result := f.Bar.compute()
    f.Logger.Printf(&quot;bar: %v&quot;, result) // Better.
    // ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re conditioned to think of certain classes of work, like writing to a log, as incidental. So we’re happy to leverage helpers, like package-global loggers, to reduce the apparent burden. But logging, like instrumentation, is often crucial to the operation of a service. And hiding dependencies in the global scope can and does come back to bite us, whether it’s something as seemingly benign as a logger, or perhaps another, more important, domain-specific component that we haven’t bothered to parameterize. Save yourself the future pain by being strict: make &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; your dependencies explicit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we should also be sure to take a sensible default for our logger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;func newFoo(..., cfg fooConfig) *foo {
    // ...
    if cfg.Logger == nil {
        cfg.Logger = log.New(ioutil.Discard, ...)
    }
    // ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update:&lt;/em&gt; for more detail on this and the subject of magic, see the June 2017 blog post on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/blog/2017/06/09/theory-of-modern-go.html&quot;&gt;theory of modern Go&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To speak about the problem generally for a moment: I’ve had a lot more production experience with logging, which has mostly just increased my respect for the problem. Logging is expensive, more expensive than you think, and can quickly become the bottleneck of your system. I wrote more extensively on the subject &lt;a href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/blog/2016/02/07/logging-v-instrumentation.html&quot;&gt;in a separate blog post&lt;/a&gt;, but to re-cap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log only &lt;em&gt;actionable information&lt;/em&gt;, which will be read by a human or a machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid fine-grained log levels — info and debug are probably enough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use structured logging — I’m biased, but I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/go-kit/kit/tree/master/log&quot;&gt;go-kit/log&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loggers are dependencies!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where logging is expensive, instrumentation is cheap. You should be instrumenting every significant component of your codebase. If it’s a resource, like a queue, instrument it according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brendangregg.com/usemethod.html&quot;&gt;Brendan Gregg’s USE method&lt;/a&gt;: utilization, saturation, and error count (rate). If it’s something like an endpoint, instrument it according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LindsayofSF/status/692191001692237825&quot;&gt;Tom Wilkie’s RED method&lt;/a&gt;: request count (rate), error count (rate), and duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any choice in the matter, &lt;a href=&quot;https://prometheus.io&quot;&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt; is probably the instrumentation system you should be using. And, of course, metrics are dependencies, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s use loggers and metrics to pivot and address global state more directly. Here are some facts about Go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;log.Print uses a fixed, global log.Logger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;http.Get uses a fixed, global http.Client&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;http.Server, by default, uses a fixed, global log.Logger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;database/sql uses a fixed, global driver registry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;func init exists only to have side effects on package-global state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These facts are convenient in the small, but awkward in the large. That is, how can we test the log output of components that use the fixed global logger? We must redirect its output, but then how can we test in parallel? Just don’t? That seems unsatisfactory. Or, if we have two independent components both making HTTP requests with different requirements, how do we manage that? With the default global http.Client, it’s quite difficult. Consider this example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;func foo() {
    resp, err := http.Get(&quot;http://zombo.com&quot;)
    // ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http.Get calls on a global in package http. It has an implicit global dependency. Which we can eliminate pretty easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;func foo(client *http.Client) {
    resp, err := client.Get(&quot;http://zombo.com&quot;)
    // ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just pass an http.Client as a parameter. But that is a concrete type, which means if we want to test this function we also need to provide a concrete http.Client, which likely forces us to do actual HTTP communication. Not great. We can do one better, by passing an interface which can Do (execute) HTTP requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;type Doer interface {
    Do(*http.Request) (*http.Response, error)
}

func foo(d Doer) {
    req, _ := http.NewRequest(&quot;GET&quot;, &quot;http://zombo.com&quot;, nil)
    resp, err := d.Do(req)
    // ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http.Client satisfies our Doer interface automatically, but now we have the freedom to pass a mock Doer implementation in our test. And that’s great: a unit test for func foo is meant to test only the behavior of foo, it can safely assume that the http.Client is going to work as advertised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of testing…&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In 2014, I reflected on our experience with various testing frameworks and helper libraries, and concluded that we never found a great deal of utility in any of them, recommending the stdlib’s approach of plain package testing with table-based tests. Broadly, I still think this is the best advice. The important thing to remember about testing in Go is that &lt;em&gt;it is just programming&lt;/em&gt;. It is not sufficiently different from other programming that it warrants its own metalanguage. And so package testing continues to be well-suited to the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TDD/BDD packages bring new, unfamiliar DSLs and control structures, increasing the cognitive burden on you and your future maintainers. I haven’t personally seen a codebase where that cost has paid off in benefits. Like global state, I believe these packages represent a false economy, and more often than not are the product of cargo-culting behaviors from other languages and ecosystems. &lt;em&gt;When in Go, do as Gophers do&lt;/em&gt;: we already have a language for writing simple, expressive tests—it’s called Go, and you probably know it pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, I do recognize my own context and biases. Like with my opinions on the GOPATH, I’ve softened a bit, and defer to those teams and organizations for whom a testing DSL or framework may make sense. If you know you want to use a package, go for it. Just be sure you’re doing it for well-defined reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another incredibly interesting topic has been designing for testing. Mitchell Hashimoto recently gave a great talk on the subject here in Berlin (&lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/mitchellh/advanced-testing-with-go&quot;&gt;SpeakerDeck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yszygk1cpEc&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;) which I think should be required viewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the thing that seems to work the best is to write Go in a generally functional style, where dependencies are explicitly enumerated, and provided as small, tightly-scoped interfaces whenever possible. Beyond being good software engineering discipline in itself, it feels like it automatically optimizes your code for easy testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;toptip&quot; readability=&quot;6.6818181818182&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#top-tip-11&quot;&gt;✪&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Top Tip&lt;/strong&gt; — Use many small interfaces to model dependencies.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in the http.Client example just above, remember that unit tests should be written to test the thing being tested, and nothing more. If you’re testing a process function, there’s no reason to also test the HTTP transport the request came in on, or the path on disk the results get written to. Provide inputs and outputs as fake implementations of interface parameters, and focus on the business logic of the method or component exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;toptip&quot; readability=&quot;6.6769230769231&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#top-tip-12&quot;&gt;✪&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Top Tip&lt;/strong&gt; — Tests only need to test the thing being tested.&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ever the hot topic. In 2014, things were nascent, and about the only concrete advice I could give was to vendor. That advice still holds today: vendoring is still the solution to dependency management for binaries. In particular, the GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT and its concomittant vendor/ subdirectory have become default in Go 1.6. So you’ll be using that layout. And, thankfully, the tools have gotten a lot better. Some I can recommend:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/FiloSottile/gvt&quot;&gt;FiloSottile/gvt&lt;/a&gt; takes a minimal approach, basically just extracting the vendor subcommand from the gb tool so it can be used standalone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Masterminds/glide&quot;&gt;Masterminds/glide&lt;/a&gt; takes a maximal approach, attempting to recreate the feel and finish of a fully-featured dependency management tool using vendoring under the hood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kardianos/govendor&quot;&gt;kardianos/govendor&lt;/a&gt; sits in the middle, providing probably the richest interface to vendoring-specific nouns and verbs, and is driving the conversation on the manifest file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/constabulary/gb&quot;&gt;constabulary/gb&lt;/a&gt; abandons the go tooling altogether in favor of a different repository layout and build mechanism. Great if you produce binaries and can mandate the build environment, e.g. in a corporate setting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;toptip&quot; readability=&quot;6.7083333333333&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#top-tip-13&quot;&gt;✪&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Top Tip&lt;/strong&gt; — Use a top tool to vendor dependencies for your binary.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big caveat for libraries. In Go, dependency management is a concern of the binary author. Libraries with vendored dependencies are very difficult to use; so difficult that it is probably better said that they are impossible to use. There are many corner cases and edge conditions that have played out in the months since vendoring was officially introduced in 1.5. (You can dig in to &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-dev/4FfTBfN2YaI&quot;&gt;one of these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/golang-nuts/AnMr9NL6dtc/UnyUUKcMCAAJ&quot;&gt;forum posts&lt;/a&gt; if you’re particularly interested in the details.) Without getting too deep in the weeds, the lesson is clear: libraries should &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; vendor dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;toptip&quot; readability=&quot;6.6865671641791&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#top-tip-14&quot;&gt;✪&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Top Tip&lt;/strong&gt; — Libraries should never vendor their dependencies.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can carve out an exception for yourself if your library has hermetically sealed its dependencies, so that none of them escape to the exported (public) API layer. No dependent types referenced in any exported functions, method signatures, structures—anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the common task of maintaining an open-source repository that contains both binaries and libraries, unfortunately, you are stuck between a rock and a hard place. You want to vendor your deps for your binaries, but you shouldn’t vendor them for your libraries, and the GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT doesn’t admit this level of granularity, from what appears to me to be regrettable oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bluntly, I don’t have an answer to this. The etcd folks have hacked together &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/coreos/etcd/tree/60425de0ff0dc8a2e7898fcd56f16669d4e4933b/cmd&quot;&gt;a solution using symlinks&lt;/a&gt; which I cannot in good faith recommend, as symlinks are not well-supported by the go toolchain and break entirely on Windows. That this works at all is more a happy accident than any consequence of design. I and others have raised all of these concerns &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/golang/go/issues/15162&quot;&gt;to the core team&lt;/a&gt;, and I hope something will happen in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Regarding building, one important lesson learned, with a hat tip to Dave Cheney: prefer go install to go build. The install verb caches build artifacts from dependencies in $GOPATH/pkg, making builds faster. It also puts binaries in $GOPATH/bin, making them easier to find and invoke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;toptip&quot; readability=&quot;6.5625&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#top-tip-15&quot;&gt;✪&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Top Tip&lt;/strong&gt; — Prefer go install to go build.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you produce a binary, don’t be afraid to try out new build tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://getgb.io&quot;&gt;gb&lt;/a&gt;, which may significantly reduce your cognitive burden. Conversely, remember that since Go 1.5 cross-compilation is built-in; just set the appropriate GOOS and GOARCH environment variables, and invoke the appropriate go command. So there’s no need for extra tools here anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding deployment, we Gophers have it pretty easy compared to languages like Ruby or Python, or even the JVM. One note: if you deploy in containers, follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kelseyhightower/optimizing-docker-images-for-static-binaries-b5696e26eb07#.r4j4suwn2&quot;&gt;advice of Kelsey Hightower&lt;/a&gt; and do it FROM scratch. Go gives us this incredible opportunity; it’s a shame not to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more general advice, think carefully before choosing a platform or orchestration system—if you even choose one at all. Likewise for jumping onto the microservices bandwagon. An elegant monolith, deployed as an AMI to an autoscaling EC2 group, is a very productive setup for small teams. Resist, or at least carefully consider, the hype.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Top Tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Put $GOPATH/bin in your $PATH, so installed binaries are easily accessible.  &lt;a class=&quot;lite&quot; href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#top-tip-1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put library code under a pkg/ subdirectory. Put binaries under a cmd/ subdirectory.  &lt;a class=&quot;lite&quot; href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#top-tip-2&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always use fully-qualified import paths. Never use relative imports.  &lt;a class=&quot;lite&quot; href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#top-tip-3&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defer to Andrew Gerrand’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://talks.golang.org/2014/names.slide&quot;&gt;naming conventions&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a class=&quot;lite&quot; href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#top-tip-4&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only func main has the right to decide which flags are available to the user.  &lt;a class=&quot;lite&quot; href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#top-tip-5&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use struct literal initialization to avoid invalid intermediate state.  &lt;a class=&quot;lite&quot; href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#top-tip-6&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid nil checks via default no-op implementations.  &lt;a class=&quot;lite&quot; href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#top-tip-7&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the zero value useful, especially in config objects.  &lt;a class=&quot;lite&quot; href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#top-tip-8&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make dependencies explicit!&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;a class=&quot;lite&quot; href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#top-tip-9&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loggers are dependencies, just like references to other components, database handles, commandline flags, etc.  &lt;a class=&quot;lite&quot; href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#top-tip-10&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use many small interfaces to model dependencies.  &lt;a class=&quot;lite&quot; href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#top-tip-11&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tests only need to test the thing being tested.  &lt;a class=&quot;lite&quot; href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#top-tip-12&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a top tool to vendor dependencies for your binary.  &lt;a class=&quot;lite&quot; href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#top-tip-13&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Libraries should never vendor their dependencies.  &lt;a class=&quot;lite&quot; href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#top-tip-14&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prefer go install to go build.  &lt;a class=&quot;lite&quot; href=&quot;https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#top-tip-15&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go has always been a conservative language, and its maturity has brought relatively few surprises and effectively no major changes. Consequently, and predictably, the community also hasn’t dramatically shifted its stances on what’s considered best practice. Instead, we’ve seen a reification of tropes and proverbs that were reasonably well-known in the early years, and a gradual movement “up the stack” as design patterns, libraries, and program structures are explored and transformed into idiomatic Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s to another 6 years of fun and productive Go programming. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/peterbourgon/status/725297831221800960&quot;&gt;🏌&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ex-Google recruiter: I was fired because I resisted “illegal” diversity efforts</title>

&lt;/aside&gt;
A former YouTube employee has sued Google—the video site’s parent company—alleging that he was wrongfully terminated from his position after he complained against hiring practices that he claimed were discriminatory against white and Asian men.
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4391847-18-CIV-00442.html&quot;&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, which was filed in late January in San Mateo Superior Court but wasn’t reported in the media until Thursday, comes at a time when many Silicon Valley &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/01/major-investors-push-apple-execs-to-be-more-diverse-its-all-white-men/&quot;&gt;companies&lt;/a&gt; (including Google) are becoming increasingly &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/10/black-members-of-congress-push-for-more-diversity-in-silicon-valley-hires/&quot;&gt;cognizant&lt;/a&gt; of a largely male, white and Asian workforce. Some companies have &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/12/slacks-top-engineer-suggests-that-google-do-blind-assessments-for-hiring/&quot;&gt;publicly&lt;/a&gt; said that they are trying to rectify this situation by working harder to find candidates who can do the job and who are also traditionally underrepresented minorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The civil complaint explains that Arne Wilberg, who is described as a 40-year-old white man by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/youtube-hiring-for-some-positions-excluded-white-and-asian-males-lawsuit-says-1519948013&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, worked as a recruiter for YouTube for seven years. In his job, Wilberg was tasked with helping to select engineering and tech talent for YouTube and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
According to the lawsuit, Wilberg received high marks for his performance as a recruiter until he began pushing back against Google’s efforts to hire a more diverse workforce in 2017. His manager, Allison Alogna, informed Wilberg and his colleagues that they were to “only accept” a certain rank of engineers (“Level 3”) if they were diverse.
&lt;p&gt;As the lawsuit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4391847-18-CIV-00442.html#document/p4/a407608&quot;&gt;continues&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April of 2017, Google’s Technology Stafﬁng Management team was instructed by Alogna to immediately cancel all Level 3 (0-5 years experience) software engineering interviews with every single applicant who was not either female, Black, or Hispanic and to purge entirely any applications by non-diverse employees from the hiring pipeline. Plaintiff refused to comply with this request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
Wilberg argues that these practices are “illegal and discriminatory,” and, as he continued to resist these practices, he increasingly chafed against his managers and colleagues. Eventually, Wilberg was fired in November 2017.
&lt;p&gt;His lawyer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dfederlaw.com/&quot;&gt;Daniel Feder&lt;/a&gt;, did not immediately respond to Ars’ request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Google said that it would “vigorously defend this lawsuit,” adding that it has a “clear policy to hire candidates based on their merit, not their identity. At the same time, we unapologetically try to find a diverse pool of qualified candidates for open roles, as this helps us hire the best people, improve our culture, and build better products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google did not respond to Ars’ further questions as to how many similar lawsuits involving alleged wrongful termination and discrimination the company has received.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Unnecessary medical care is harming patients physically and financially (2015)</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; data-reactid=&quot;160&quot; readability=&quot;165&quot;&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;161&quot;&gt;It was lunchtime before my afternoon surgery clinic, which meant that I was at my desk, eating a ham-and-cheese sandwich and clicking through medical articles. Among those which caught my eye: a British case report on the first 3-D-printed hip implanted in a human being, a Canadian analysis of the rising volume of emergency-room visits by children who have ingested magnets, and a Colorado study finding that the percentage of fatal motor-vehicle accidents involving marijuana had doubled since its commercial distribution became legal. The one that got me thinking, however, was a study of more than a million Medicare patients. It suggested that a huge proportion had received care that was simply a waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;165&quot;&gt;The researchers called it “low-value care.” But, really, it was no-value care. They studied how often people received one of twenty-six tests or treatments that scientific and professional organizations have consistently determined to have no benefit or to be outright harmful. Their list included doing an EEG for an uncomplicated headache (EEGs are for diagnosing seizure disorders, not headaches), or doing a CT or MRI scan for low-back pain in patients without any signs of a neurological problem (studies consistently show that scanning such patients adds nothing except cost), or putting a coronary-artery stent in patients with stable cardiac disease (the likelihood of a heart attack or death after five years is unaffected by the stent). In just a single year, the researchers reported, twenty-five to forty-two per cent of Medicare patients received at least one of the twenty-six useless tests and treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;167&quot;&gt;Could pointless medical care really be that widespread? Six years ago, I wrote an article for this magazine, titled “The Cost Conundrum,” which explored the problem of unnecessary care in McAllen, Texas, a community with some of the highest per-capita costs for Medicare in the nation. But was McAllen an anomaly or did it represent an emerging norm? In 2010, the Institute of Medicine issued a report stating that waste accounted for thirty per cent of health-care spending, or some seven hundred and fifty billion dollars a year, which was more than our nation’s entire budget for K-12 education. The report found that higher prices, administrative expenses, and fraud accounted for almost half of this waste. Bigger than any of those, however, was the amount spent on unnecessary health-care services. Now a far more detailed study confirmed that such waste was pervasive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;169&quot;&gt;I decided to do a crude check. I am a general surgeon with a specialty in tumors of the thyroid and other endocrine organs. In my clinic that afternoon, I saw eight new patients with records complete enough that I could review their past medical history in detail. One saw me about a hernia, one about a fatty lump growing in her arm, one about a hormone-secreting mass in her chest, and five about thyroid cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;171&quot;&gt;To my surprise, it appeared that seven of those eight had received unnecessary care. Two of the patients had been given high-cost diagnostic tests of no value. One was sent for an MRI after an ultrasound and a biopsy of a neck lump proved suspicious for thyroid cancer. (An MRI does not image thyroid cancer nearly as well as the ultrasound the patient had already had.) The other received a new, expensive, and, in her circumstances, irrelevant type of genetic testing. A third patient had undergone surgery for a lump that was bothering him, but whatever the surgeon removed it wasn’t the lump—the patient still had it after the operation. Four patients had undergone inappropriate arthroscopic knee surgery for chronic joint damage. (Arthroscopy can repair certain types of acute tears to the cartilage of the knee. But years of research, including randomized trials, have shown that the operation is of no help for chronic arthritis- or age-related damage.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;173&quot;&gt;Virtually every family in the country, the research indicates, has been subject to overtesting and overtreatment in one form or another. The costs appear to take thousands of dollars out of the paychecks of every household each year. Researchers have come to refer to financial as well as physical “toxicities” of inappropriate care—including reduced spending on food, clothing, education, and shelter. Millions of people are receiving drugs that aren’t helping them, operations that aren’t going to make them better, and scans and tests that do nothing beneficial for them, and often cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;175&quot;&gt;Why does this fact barely seem to register publicly? Well, as a doctor, I am far more concerned about doing too little than doing too much. It’s the scan, the test, the operation that I &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;177&quot;&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have done that sticks with me—sometimes for years. More than a decade ago, I saw a young woman in the emergency room who had severe pelvic pain. A standard X-ray showed nothing. I examined her and found signs of pelvic inflammatory disease, which is most often caused by sexually transmitted diseases. She insisted that she hadn’t been sexually active, but I didn’t listen. If I had, I might have ordered a pelvic CT scan or even recommended exploratory surgery to investigate further. We didn’t do that until later, by which time the real source of her symptoms, a twisted loop of bowel in her pelvis, had turned gangrenous, requiring surgery. By contrast, I can’t remember anyone I sent for an unnecessary CT scan or operated on for questionable reasons a decade ago. There’s nothing less memorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;180&quot;&gt;It is different, however, when I think about my experience as a patient or a family member. I can readily recall a disturbing number of instances of unnecessary care. My mother once fainted in the Kroger’s grocery store in our Ohio home town. Emergency workers transported her to a hospital eighty miles away, in Columbus, where doctors did an ultrasound of her carotid arteries and a cardiac catheterization, too, neither of which is recommended as part of the diagnostic workup for someone who’s had a fainting episode, and neither of which revealed anything significant. Only then did someone sit down with her and take a proper history; it revealed that she’d had dizziness, likely from dehydration and lack of food, which caused her to pass out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO&quot; data-reactid=&quot;194&quot;&gt;“The goddesses want some young dudes.”&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;202&quot;&gt;I began asking people if they or their family had been subject to what they thought was unnecessary testing or treatment. Almost everyone had a story to tell. Some were appalling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;204&quot;&gt;My friend Bruce told me what happened when his eighty-two-year-old father developed fainting episodes. His doctors did a carotid ultrasound and a cardiac catheterization. The tests showed severe atherosclerotic blockages in three coronary arteries and both carotid arteries. The news didn’t come as a shock. He had smoked two packs of cigarettes a day since the age of seventeen, and in his retirement years was paying the price, with chronic lung disease, an aortic-aneurysm repair at sixty-five, a pacemaker at seventy-four, and kidney failure at seventy-nine, requiring dialysis three days a week. The doctors recommended doing a three-vessel cardiac-bypass operation as soon as possible, followed, a week or two later, by surgery to open up one of his carotid arteries. The father deferred the decision-making to the son, who researched hospitals and found a team with a great reputation and lots of experience. The team told him that the combined procedures posed clear risks to his father—for instance, his chance of a stroke would be around fifteen per cent—but that the procedures had become very routine, and the doctors were confident that they were far more likely to be successful than not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;206&quot;&gt;It didn’t occur to Bruce until later to question what the doctors meant by “successful.” The blockages weren’t causing his father’s fainting episodes or any other impairments to his life. The operation would not make him feel better. Instead, “success” to the doctors meant reducing his future risk of a stroke. How long would it take for the future benefit to outweigh the immediate risk of surgery? The doctors didn’t say, but carotid surgery in a patient like Bruce’s father reduces stroke risk by about one percentage point per year. Therefore, it would take fifteen years before the benefit of the operation would exceed the fifteen-per-cent risk of the operation. And he had a life expectancy far shorter than that—very likely just two or three years. The potential benefits of the procedures were dwarfed by their risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;208&quot;&gt;Bruce’s father had a stroke during the cardiac surgery. “For me, I’m kicking myself,” Bruce now says. “Because I remember who he was before he went into the operating room, and I’m thinking, Why did I green-light an eighty-something-year-old, very diseased man to have a major operation like this? I’m looking in his eyes and they’re like stones. There’s no life in his eyes. There’s no recognition. He’s like the living dead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;210&quot;&gt;A week later, Bruce’s father recovered his ability to talk, although much of what he said didn’t make sense. But he had at least survived. “We’re going to put this one in the win column,” Bruce recalls the surgeon saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;212&quot;&gt;“I said, ‘Are you fucking kidding me?’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;214&quot;&gt;His dad had to move into a nursing home. “He was only half there mentally,” Bruce said. Nine months later, his father died. That is what low-value health care can be like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; data-reactid=&quot;216&quot; readability=&quot;229&quot;&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;217&quot;&gt;I’m a fan of the radio show “Car Talk” (which ceased taping in 2012 but still airs in reruns), and a regular concern of callers who sought the comic but genuine advice of its repair-shop-owning hosts, Tom and Ray Magliozzi, was whether they were getting snookered by car mechanics into repairs they didn’t need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;219&quot;&gt;“There’s no question we have considerable up-selling in the industry,” Ray told me when I reached him by phone. “Quickie-lube places are the worst for this. I won’t name names, but they tend to have the word ‘lube’ in them.” He let out that &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;221&quot;&gt;nyuk-nyuk-nyuk&lt;/em&gt; laugh he has. “You can’t make money on a $29.95 oil change. So they try to sell you on a lot of stuff. First level, they sell you something you don’t need but at least doesn’t hurt. Second level, they do some real damage mucking around.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;224&quot;&gt;Even reputable professionals with the best intentions tend toward overkill, he said. To illustrate the point, he, too, had a medical story to tell. Eight months earlier, he’d torn a meniscus in his knee doing lunges. “Doing lunges is probably something a sixty-five-year-old should not be doing to begin with,” he admitted. He was referred to an orthopedic surgeon to discuss whether to do physical therapy or surgery. “Very good guy. Very unassuming. I had no reason not to trust the guy. But I also know he’s a surgeon. So he’s going to present surgery to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;226&quot;&gt;Sure enough, the surgeon recommended arthroscopic knee surgery. “This is going to fix it,” Ray recalled him saying. “In by nine, out by noon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;230&quot;&gt;Ray went for a second opinion, to a physical therapist, who, of course, favored physical therapy, just as the surgeon favored surgery. Ray chose physical therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;232&quot;&gt;“How’d it turn out?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;234&quot;&gt;“Amazingly well,” he said. “I feel pretty darn good right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;236&quot;&gt;“What did the surgeon say when you told him you weren’t going to do the surgery?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;238&quot;&gt;“He said, ‘No problem, go to P.T., and when that doesn’t work we can schedule the surgery,’ ” Ray recalled. “Who knows? Maybe I will end up having to go back. He wasn’t trying to pull the wool over my eyes. But he believed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;256&quot;&gt;What Ray recommended to his car-owning listeners was the approach that he adopted as a patient—caveat emptor. He did his research. He made informed choices. He tried to be a virtuous patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;258&quot;&gt;The virtuous patient is up against long odds, however. One major problem is what economists call information asymmetry. In 1963, Kenneth Arrow, who went on to win the Nobel Prize in Economics, demonstrated the severe disadvantages that buyers have when they know less about a good than the seller does. His prime example was health care. Doctors generally know more about the value of a given medical treatment than patients, who have little ability to determine the quality of the advice they are getting. Doctors, therefore, are in a powerful position. We can recommend care of little or no value because it enhances our incomes, because it’s our habit, or because we genuinely but incorrectly believe in it, and patients will tend to follow our recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;260&quot;&gt;Another powerful force toward unnecessary care emerged years after Arrow’s paper: the phenomenon of overtesting, which is a by-product of all the new technologies we have for peering into the human body. It has been hard for patients and doctors to recognize that tests and scans can be harmful. Why not take a look and see if anything is abnormal? People are discovering why not. The United States is a country of three hundred million people who annually undergo around fifteen million nuclear medicine scans, a hundred million CT and MRI scans, and almost ten billion laboratory tests. Often, these are fishing expeditions, and since no one is perfectly normal you tend to find a lot of fish. If you look closely and often enough, almost everyone will have a little nodule that can’t be completely explained, a lab result that is a bit off, a heart tracing that doesn’t look quite right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;262&quot;&gt;Excessive testing is a problem for a number of reasons. For one thing, some diagnostic studies are harmful in themselves—we’re doing so many CT scans and other forms of imaging that rely on radiation that they are believed to be increasing the population’s cancer rates. These direct risks are often greater than we account for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;264&quot;&gt;What’s more, the value of any test depends on how likely you are to be having a significant problem in the first place. If you have crushing chest pain and shortness of breath, you start with a high likelihood of having a serious heart condition, and an electrocardiogram has significant value. A heart tracing that doesn’t look quite right usually means trouble. But, if you have no signs or symptoms of heart trouble, an electrocardiogram adds no useful information; a heart tracing that doesn’t look quite right is mostly noise. Experts recommend against doing electrocardiograms on healthy people, but millions are done each year, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;266&quot;&gt;Resolving the uncertainty of non-normal results can lead to procedures that have costs of their own. You get an EKG. The heart tracing is not completely normal, and a follow-up procedure is recommended. Perhaps it’s a twenty-four-hour heart-rhythm monitor or an echocardiogram or a stress test or a cardiac catheterization; perhaps you end up with all of them before everyone is assured that everything is all right. Meanwhile, we’ve added thousands of dollars in costs and, sometimes, physical risks, not to mention worry and days of missed work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;268&quot;&gt;Overtesting has also created a new, unanticipated problem: overdiagnosis. This isn’t misdiagnosis—the erroneous diagnosis of a disease. This is the correct diagnosis of a disease that is never going to bother you in your lifetime. We’ve long assumed that if we screen a healthy population for diseases like cancer or coronary-artery disease, and catch those diseases early, we’ll be able to treat them before they get dangerously advanced, and save lives in large numbers. But it hasn’t turned out that way. For instance, cancer screening with mammography, ultrasound, and blood testing has dramatically increased the detection of breast, thyroid, and prostate cancer during the past quarter century. We’re treating hundreds of thousands more people each year for these diseases than we ever have. Yet only a tiny reduction in death, if any, has resulted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;270&quot;&gt;My last patient in clinic that day, Mrs. E., a woman in her fifties, had been found to have a thyroid lump. A surgeon removed it, and a biopsy was done. The lump was benign. But, under the microscope, the pathologist found a pinpoint “microcarcinoma” next to it, just five millimetres in size. Anything with the term “carcinoma” in it is bound to be alarming—“carcinoma” means cancer, however “micro” it might be. So when the surgeon told Mrs. E. that a cancer had been found in her thyroid, which was not exactly wrong, she believed he’d saved her life, which was not exactly right. More than a third of the population turns out to have these tiny cancers in their thyroid, but fewer than one in a hundred thousand people die from thyroid cancer a year. Only the rare microcarcinoma develops the capacity to behave like a dangerous, invasive cancer. (Indeed, some experts argue that we should stop calling them “cancers” at all.) That’s why expert guidelines recommend no further treatment when microcarcinomas are found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Callout__inset-left___2rZjf&quot; data-type=&quot;callout&quot; data-callout=&quot;inset-left&quot; data-reactid=&quot;274&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO&quot; data-reactid=&quot;284&quot;&gt;“Miss, did you order the small fiery Hawaiian with Fauve influences?”&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;292&quot;&gt;Nonetheless, it’s difficult to do nothing. The patient’s surgeon ordered a series of ultrasounds, every few months, to monitor the remainder of her thyroid. When the imaging revealed another five-millimetre nodule, he recommended removing the rest of her thyroid, out of an abundance of caution. The patient was seeing me only because the surgeon had to cancel her operation, owing to his own medical issues. She simply wanted me to fill in for the job—but it was a job, I advised her, that didn’t need doing in the first place. The surgery posed a greater risk of causing harm than any microcarcinoma we might find, I explained. There was a risk of vocal-cord paralysis and life-threatening bleeding. Removing the thyroid would require that she take a daily hormone-replacement pill for the rest of her life. We were better off just checking her nodules in a year and acting only if there was significant enlargement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;294&quot;&gt;H. Gilbert Welch, a Dartmouth Medical School professor, is an expert on overdiagnosis, and in his excellent new book, “Less Medicine, More Health,” he explains the phenomenon this way: we’ve assumed, he says, that cancers are all like rabbits that you want to catch before they escape the barnyard pen. But some are more like birds—the most aggressive cancers have already taken flight before you can discover them, which is why some people still die from cancer, despite early detection. And lots are more like turtles. They aren’t going anywhere. Removing them won’t make any difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;296&quot;&gt;We’ve learned these lessons the hard way. Over the past two decades, we’ve tripled the number of thyroid cancers we detect and remove in the United States, but we haven’t reduced the death rate at all. In South Korea, widespread ultrasound screening has led to a fifteen-fold increase in detection of small thyroid cancers. Thyroid cancer is now the No. 1 cancer diagnosed and treated in that country. But, as Welch points out, the death rate hasn’t dropped one iota there, either. (Meanwhile, the number of people with permanent complications from thyroid surgery has skyrocketed.) It’s all over-diagnosis. We’re just catching turtles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;298&quot;&gt;Every cancer has a different ratio of rabbits, turtles, and birds, which makes the story enormously complicated. A recent review concludes that, depending on the organ involved, anywhere from fifteen to seventy-five per cent of cancers found are indolent tumors—turtles—that have stopped growing or are growing too slowly to be life-threatening. Cervical and colon cancers are rarely indolent; screening and early treatment have been associated with a notable reduction in deaths from those cancers. Prostate and breast cancers are more like thyroid cancers. Imaging tends to uncover a substantial reservoir of indolent disease and relatively few rabbit-like cancers that are life-threatening but treatable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;300&quot;&gt;We now have a vast and costly health-care industry devoted to finding and responding to turtles. Our ever more sensitive technologies turn up more and more abnormalities—cancers, clogged arteries, damaged-looking knees and backs—that aren’t actually causing problems and never will. And then we doctors try to fix them, even though the result is often more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;302&quot;&gt;The forces that have led to a global epidemic of overtesting, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment are easy to grasp. Doctors get paid for doing more, not less. We’re more afraid of doing too little than of doing too much. And patients often feel the same way. They’re likely to be grateful for the extra test done in the name of “being thorough”—and then for the procedure to address what’s found. Mrs. E. was such a patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;304&quot;&gt;Mrs. E. had a turtle. She would have been better off if we’d never monitored her thyroid in the first place. But, now that we’d found something abnormal, she couldn’t imagine just keeping an eye on it. She wanted to take her chances with surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; data-reactid=&quot;306&quot; readability=&quot;187&quot;&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;307&quot;&gt;The main way we’ve tried to stop unnecessary treatments has been through policing by insurers: they could refuse to pay for anything that looked like inappropriate care, whether it was an emergency-room visit, an MRI scan, or an operation. And it worked. During the nineteen-nineties, the “Mother, may I?” strategy flattened health-care costs. But it also provoked a backlash. Faceless corporate bureaucrats second-guessing medical decisions from afar created an infuriating amount of hassle for physicians and patients trying to orchestrate necessary care—and sometimes led to outrageous mistakes. Insurance executives were accused of killing people. Facing a public outcry, they backed off, and health-care costs resumed their climb. A decade and a half later, however, more interesting approaches have emerged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;309&quot;&gt;Consider the case of Michael Taylor. A six-foot-tall, fifty-five-year-old optician from Ogden, Utah, Taylor threw his back out a year ago, while pulling weeds from his lawn. When he tried to straighten up, pain bolted from his lower back through his hips and down both thighs. He made his stooped way up his front-porch steps, into his house, and called his wife, Sandy, at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;313&quot;&gt;“For him to call meant it was &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;315&quot;&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; bad,” she said later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;318&quot;&gt;Taylor was a stoic guy who had had back issues for a long time. By his early thirties, he had already undergone two spine operations: the fusion of a vertebra in his neck, which was fractured in a car accident, and the removal of a ruptured disk in his lower back that had damaged a nerve root, causing a foot drop—his left foot slapped when he walked. He’d had periodic trouble with back spasms ever since. For the most part, he managed them through stretches and exercise. He had been a martial artist since the age of thirteen—he’d earned a third-degree black belt—and retained tremendous flexibility. He could still do splits. Occasionally, if an attack was bad, he saw a pain specialist and got a spinal injection of steroids, which usually worked for a while. This episode, however, was worse than any before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;336&quot;&gt;“He could hardly walk,” Sandy said. He tried sleeping in a recliner and waiting out the pain. But it didn’t go away. He called his primary-care physician, who ordered an MRI. It showed degenerative disk disease in his lumbar spine—a bulge or narrowing of disk space between two of the vertebrae in his lower back. The doctor prescribed muscle relaxants and pain medications, and said that Taylor might need spinal surgery. She referred him to a local neurosurgeon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;338&quot;&gt;Taylor put off making the appointment. He did his lower-back stretches and range-of-motion exercises, and worked on losing weight. These measures helped a little, but he still couldn’t sleep in his bed or manage more than a shuffling walk. After four weeks with no improvement, he finally went to see the surgeon, who recommended fusing Taylor’s spine where his disk was bulging. Taylor would lose some mobility—his days of spinning kicks were over—and success was not guaranteed, but the doctor thought that it was the best option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;340&quot;&gt;“He said the surgery would be, like, a fifty-fifty thing,” Taylor recalled. “Half of people would see great success. The other half would see little or no difference. And there’d be a few who find it makes the pain worse.” There was also the matter of cost. The vision center he managed was in a Walmart superstore, and the co-payments and deductibles with the company insurance plan were substantial. His bills were likely to run past a thousand dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;342&quot;&gt;But Taylor had heard about a program that Walmart had launched for employees undergoing spine, heart, or transplant procedures. Employees would have no out-of-pocket costs at all if they got the procedure at one of six chosen “centers of excellence”: the Cleveland Clinic; the Mayo Clinic; Virginia Mason Medical Center, in Washington; Scott and White Memorial Hospital, in Texas; Geisinger Medical Center, in Pennsylvania; and Mercy Hospital Springfield, in Missouri. Taylor learned that the designated spine center for his region was Virginia Mason, in Seattle. He used to live in Washington, and the back surgery he’d had when he was younger was at the same hospital. He trusted the place, and it had a good reputation. He decided to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;344&quot;&gt;The program connected him to the hospital, and its staff took care of everything from there. They set up his appointments and arranged the travel for him and his wife. All expenses were covered, even their food and hotel costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;346&quot;&gt;“They flew us from Salt Lake City and picked us up at the airport in a town car,” Taylor said. He said he felt like royalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;348&quot;&gt;Walmart wasn’t providing this benefit out of the goodness of its corporate heart, of course. It was hoping that employees would get better surgical results, sure, but also that the company would save money. Spine, heart, and transplant procedures are among the most expensive in medicine, running from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Nationwide, we spend more money on spinal fusions, for instance, than on any other operation—thirteen billion dollars in 2011. And if there are complications the costs of the procedure go up further. The medical and disability costs can be enormous, especially if an employee is left permanently unable to return to work. These six centers had notably low complication rates and provided Walmart a fixed, package price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;350&quot;&gt;Two years into the program, an unexpected pattern is emerging: the biggest savings and improvements in care are coming from avoiding procedures that shouldn’t be done in the first place. Before the participating hospitals operate, their doctors conduct their own evaluation. And, according to Sally Welborn, the senior vice-president for benefits at Walmart, those doctors are finding that around thirty per cent of the spinal procedures that employees were told they needed are inappropriate. Dr. Charles Nussbaum, until recently the head of neurosurgery at Virginia Mason Medical Center, confirmed that large numbers of the patients sent to his hospital for spine surgery do not meet its criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;352&quot;&gt;Michael Taylor was one of those patients. Disk disease like the kind seen on his MRI is exceedingly common. Studies of adults with no back pain find that half or more have degenerative disk disease on imaging. Disk disease is a turtle—an abnormality that generally causes no harm. It’s different when a diseased disk compresses the spinal cord or nerve root enough to cause specific symptoms, such as pain or weakness along the affected nerve’s territory, typically the leg or the arm. In those situations, surgery is proved to be more effective than nonsurgical treatment. For someone without such symptoms, though, there is no evidence that surgery helps to reduce pain or to prevent problems. One study found that between 1997 and 2005 national health-care expenditures for back-pain patients increased by nearly two-thirds, yet population surveys revealed no improvement in the level of back pain reported by patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;356&quot;&gt;There are gray-zone cases, but Taylor’s case was straightforward. Nussbaum said that Taylor’s MRI showed no disk abnormality compressing his spinal cord or nerve root. He had no new leg or foot weakness. His pain went down both legs and not past the knee, which didn’t fit with disk disease. The symptoms were consistent with muscle spasms or chronic nerve sensitivity resulting from his previous injuries. Fusing Taylor’s spine—locking two vertebrae together with bolts and screws—wouldn’t fix these problems. At best, it would stop him from bending where it hurt, but that was like wiring a person’s jaw shut because his tooth hurts when he chews. Fusing the spine also increases the load on the disks above and below the level of fusion, making future back problems significantly more likely. And that’s if things go well. Nussbaum recommended against the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;358&quot;&gt;This was not what Taylor’s wife wanted to hear. Had they come all this way for nothing? “I got kind of angry,” Sandy told me later. She wanted his back problem solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;378&quot;&gt;He did, too. But he was relieved to hear that he wouldn’t have to undergo another back operation. Nussbaum’s explanations made sense to him, and he had never liked the idea of having his spine fused. Moreover, unlike most places, the Virginia Mason spine center had him seen not only by a surgeon but also by a rehabilitation-medicine specialist, who suggested a nonsurgical approach: a spinal injection that afternoon, continued back exercises, and a medication specifically for neuropathic pain—chronic nerve sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;380&quot;&gt;“Within a couple of weeks, I was literally pain free,” Taylor said. It was six months after his visit to Seattle, and he could do things he hadn’t been able to do in decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;382&quot;&gt;“I was just amazed,” Sandy said. “The longer it’s been, the better he is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;384&quot;&gt;If an insurer had simply decreed Taylor’s back surgery to be unnecessary, and denied coverage, the Taylors would have been outraged. But the worst part is that he would not have got better. It isn’t enough to eliminate unnecessary care. It has to be replaced with necessary care. And that is the hidden harm: unnecessary care often crowds out necessary care, particularly when the necessary care is less remunerative. Walmart, of all places, is showing one way to take action against no-value care—rewarding the doctors and systems that do a better job and the patients who seek them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; data-reactid=&quot;386&quot; readability=&quot;131&quot;&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;387&quot;&gt;Six years ago, in “The Cost Conundrum,” I compared McAllen with another Texas border town, El Paso. They had the same demographics—the same levels of severe poverty, poor health, illegal immigration—but El Paso had half the per-capita Medicare costs and the same or better results. The difference was that McAllen’s doctors were ordering more of almost everything—diagnostic testing, hospital admissions, procedures. Medicare patients in McAllen received forty per cent more surgery, almost twice as many bladder scopes and heart studies, and two to three times as many pacemakers, cardiac bypass operations, carotid endarterectomies, and coronary stents. Per-capita spending on home-health services was five times higher than in El Paso and more than half of what many American communities spent on all health care. The amount of unnecessary care appeared to be huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;389&quot;&gt;What explained this? Our piecework payment system—rewarding doctors for the quantity of care provided, regardless of the results—was a key factor. The system gives ample reward for overtreatment and no reward for eliminating it. But these inducements applied everywhere. Why did McAllen succumb to them more than other medical communities did? Doctors there described a profit-maximizing medical culture. Specialists not only made money from the services they provided; many also owned stakes in home-health-care agencies, surgery and imaging centers, and the local for-profit hospital, which brought them even bigger returns from health-care overuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;391&quot;&gt;The test of health-care reform, I wrote, was whether McAllen or El Paso would become the new norm. Would McAllen’s costs come down or El Paso’s go up? Now that it has been five years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, I thought I’d find out. I returned to the economist Jonathan Skinner, of the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, who had provided the earlier analysis of the Medicare data, and worked with him to get a sense of what recent data reveal. As it turns out, the cost of a Medicare patient has flattened across the country, El Paso included. U.S. health-care inflation is the lowest it has been in more than fifty years. Most startling of all, McAllen has been changing its ways. Between 2009 and 2012, its costs dropped almost three thousand dollars per Medicare recipient. Skinner projects the total savings to taxpayers to have reached almost half a &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;393&quot;&gt;billion&lt;/em&gt; dollars by the end of 2014. The hope of reform had been to simply “bend the curve.” This was savings on an unprecedented scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;396&quot;&gt;Skinner showed me the details. In-patient hospital visits dropped by about ten per cent—and physicians reduced the mad amounts of home-health-care spending by nearly forty per cent. McAllen’s spending on ambulance rides—previously the highest in the country—dropped by almost forty per cent, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;400&quot;&gt;I followed up with doctors there to find out how this had happened. I started with Lester Dyke, a cardiac surgeon who was one of many doctors troubled by what they were seeing, but the only one to let me quote him by name in my McAllen piece. (“Medicine has become a pig trough here,” he had told me. “We took a wrong turn when doctors stopped being doctors and became businessmen.”) After it was published, television crews descended on the town. Texas newspapers did follow-up investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;402&quot;&gt;“The reaction here was fierce, just a tremendous amount of finger-pointing and yelling and screaming,” Dyke recently told me. The piece infuriated the local medical community, which felt unfairly singled out. And Dyke paid a steep price: “I became persona non grata overnight.” Colleagues said that he would be to blame if they lost money. Cardiologists stopped sending him patients. “My cases went down by ninety per cent,” he told me. He had to give up his practice at Doctors Hospital at Renaissance, the for-profit hospital, after it became clear that he wasn’t welcome there, but he was able to continue doing some surgery at two other hospitals. When I talked to Dyke in the first months afterward, he’d sounded low. The few friends who voiced support didn’t want to be seen in public with him. He thought he might be forced to retire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;404&quot;&gt;Yet he insisted that he had no regrets. Two of his children went into medicine, and in a medical-ethics class his son was assigned the article. The professor asked whether he was related to the Dr. Dyke quoted in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;406&quot;&gt;“Yes, I am,” he said proudly. “That’s my crazy dad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;408&quot;&gt;“I don’t think you often get a chance in life to stand up to all the badness,” Dyke told me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;428&quot;&gt;With time, the anger of colleagues subsided. Many of them resumed sending him patients. Within a couple of years, he was back to an annual caseload of three hundred open-heart operations. Meanwhile, it got harder for McAllen physicians to ignore the evidence about unnecessary care. Several federal prosecutions cracked down on outright fraud. Seven doctors agreed to a twenty-eight-million-dollar settlement for taking illegal kickbacks when they referred their patients to specialty medical services. An ambulance-company owner was indicted for reporting six hundred and twenty-one ambulance rides that allegedly never happened. Four clinic operators were sent to jail for billing more than thirteen thousand visits and procedures under the name of a physician with dementia. The prosecutions involved only a tiny fraction of the medical community. But Dyke thought it led doctors to say to themselves, “Hey, we’re under the magnifying glass. We need to make sure we’re doing things strictly by the book.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;430&quot;&gt;Jose Peña, an internist, was a board member at Doctors Hospital at Renaissance in 2009. When we spoke recently, he didn’t hesitate to tell me the immediate reaction his colleagues had to what I’d written. “We hated you,” he said. The story “put us in a spotlight, in a bad way,” but, he added, “in a good way at the same time.” They hadn’t known that they were one of the most expensive communities in the country, he maintained. They knew there were problems, “but we did not know the magnitude.” His hospital did its own analysis of the data and reluctantly came to the same conclusion that the article did: inappropriate and unnecessary care was a serious problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;432&quot;&gt;The major overuse of home-health-care services proved particularly embarrassing. “We didn’t know that home health was a thousand dollars a month” for each patient, Peña said. People in the medical community had never paid attention to how much of it they were ordering or how little of it was really needed. He led monthly staff meetings with more than four hundred local physicians and began encouraging them to be more mindful about signing home-health-care orders. Within a year, home-health-care agencies started going out of business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;434&quot;&gt;But more interesting was how broad and enduring the cost decline has been. E.R. visits, hospital admissions, tests, and procedures all fell from the Texas stratosphere. And, years after the attention and embarrassment had passed, the costs continued to fall. Bad publicity, a few prosecutions, and some stiffened regulatory requirements here and there couldn’t explain that. I probed for months, talking to local doctors and poring over data. And I’ve come to think that a major reason for the change may be a collection of primary-care doctors who don’t even seem to recognize the impact of what they’ve been doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; data-reactid=&quot;436&quot; readability=&quot;215&quot;&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;437&quot;&gt;Armando Osio is a sixty-three-year-old family physician in McAllen. In 2009, when the article came out, he did not own part of an imaging center or sleep-testing center or hospital or any other medical money-making venture. He didn’t have any procedures or tests that he made big money from. He was just a primary-care doctor doing what primary-care doctors do—seeing patient after patient every twenty to thirty minutes, for about sixty dollars a visit. That’s what Medicare paid; private insurance paid more, and Medicaid or the uninsured paid less. He earned nothing like the income of the specialists that I’d written about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;439&quot;&gt;Then, later that year, officials at a large medical group called WellMed contacted Osio. They wanted to establish a practice in McAllen, catering to Medicare patients, and asked whether he’d join them. WellMed had contracted with Medicare H.M.O. plans to control their costs. Its pitch to clinicians was that, if a doctor improved the quality of care, this would save on costs, and WellMed would share those savings with the doctor in the form of bonuses. That meant Osio would have to see fewer patients, for longer visits, but WellMed assured him that, if he could show measurable quality improvements, he’d actually make more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;443&quot;&gt;Osio was skeptical, but he agreed to see some of WellMed’s patients. When he was in training, he’d been interested in geriatrics and preventive medicine. In practice, he hadn’t had time to use those skills. Now he could. With WellMed’s help, Osio brought on a physician assistant and other staff to help with less complex patients. He focussed on the sicker, often poorer patients, and he found that his work became more satisfying. With the bonuses for higher patient satisfaction, reducing hospital admissions, and lowering cardiology costs, his income went up. This was the way he wanted to practice—being rewarded for doing right rather than for the disheartening business of churning through more and more people. Within a year, he’d switched his practice so that he was seeing almost entirely WellMed patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;445&quot;&gt;He gave me an example of one. That day, he’d seen an elderly man who had taken a bad spill two or three weeks earlier, resulting in a contused kidney and a compression fracture of his lower spine. After a couple of days in the hospital, he’d been sent home. But the pain remained unmanageable. He called Osio’s office seeking help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;447&quot;&gt;If the man had called five years ago, a receptionist would have told him that the schedule was full for days and sent him to an emergency room. There, he would have waited hours, been seen by someone who didn’t know his story, been given a repeat CT or MRI, and then likely have been kept for another hospital stay. Once the doctors were sure that the situation wasn’t dangerous, he would finally have been sent home, with pain medicine and instructions to see his primary-care doctor. Cost: a few thousand dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;449&quot;&gt;Now when the man called, the receptionist slotted him to see Osio that afternoon. The doctor examined him and, being familiar with his case, determined that he had no worsening signs requiring imaging. He counselled patience and offered reassurance, gave him pain medication, and sent him home, with a plan for his nurse to check on him the next day. Cost: at most, a hundred dollars. And the patient got swifter, better care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;469&quot;&gt;I spoke to Carlos Hernandez, an internist and the president of WellMed. He explained that the medical group was founded twenty-five years ago, in San Antonio, by a geriatrician who believed that what the oldest and sickest most needed in our hyper-specialized medical system was slower, more dedicated primary care. “Our philosophy is that the primary-care physician and patient should become the hub of the entire health-care-delivery system,” Hernandez said. He viewed the primary-care doctor as a kind of contractor for patients, reining in pointless testing, procedures, and emergency-room visits, coördinating treatment, and helping to find specialists who practice thoughtfully and effectively. Our technology- and specialty-intensive health system has resisted this kind of role, but countries that have higher proportions of general practitioners have better medical outcomes, better patient experiences, and, according to a European study, lower cost growth. WellMed found insurers who saw these advantages and were willing to pay for this model of care. Today, WellMed has more than a hundred clinics, fifteen hundred primary-care doctors, and around a quarter of a million patients across Texas and Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;471&quot;&gt;There’s a reason that WellMed focussed on these two states. They are among the nation’s most expensive states for Medicare and are less well-supplied with primary care. An independent 2011 analysis of the company’s Texas clinics found that, although the patient population they drew from tended to be less healthy than the over-all Medicare population (being older and having higher rates of diabetes and chronic lung disease, for instance), their death rates were half of the Texas average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;473&quot;&gt;This last part puzzled me. I had started to recognize how unnecessary care could crowd out necessary care—but enough that dedicated primary care could cut death rates in half? That seemed hard to believe. As I learned more about how Dr. Osio’s practice had changed, though, I began to grasp how it could happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;475&quot;&gt;He told me, for instance, about a new patient he’d seen, a sixty-five-year-old man with diabetes. His blood-sugar level was dangerously high, at a level that can signify a full-blown diabetic crisis, with severe dehydration, rising acid levels in the blood, and a risk of death. The man didn’t look ill, though. His vital signs were normal. Osio ordered a urine test, which confirmed that the man was not in crisis. That was, in a way, a bad sign. It meant that his diabetes was so out of control that his body had developed a tolerance to big spikes in blood sugar. Unchecked, his diabetes would eventually cause something terrible—kidney failure, a heart attack, blindness, or the kind of wound-healing problem that leads to amputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;477&quot;&gt;Previously, Osio would not have had the time or the resources to do much for the man. So he would have sent him to the hospital. The staff there would have done a battery of tests to confirm what Osio already knew—that his blood sugar was way too high. They would have admitted him, given him insulin, and brought his blood sugar down to normal. And that would have been about it. The thousands of dollars spent on the hospital admission would have masked a galling reality: no one was addressing the man’s core medical problem, which was that he had a chronic and deadly disease that remained dangerously out of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;481&quot;&gt;But now WellMed gave Osio bonuses if his patients’ diabetes was under better control, and helped him to develop a system for achieving this. Osio spent three-quarters of an hour with the man, going over his pill bottles and getting him to explain what he understood about his condition and how to treat it. The man was a blue-collar worker with limited schooling, and Osio discovered that he had some critical misunderstandings. For instance, although he checked his blood-sugar level every day, he wrongly believed that if the level was normal he didn’t need to take his medicine. No, Osio told him; his diabetes medication was like his blood-pressure medication—he should never skip a dose unless the home measurements were too low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;483&quot;&gt;Osio explained what diabetes is, how dangerous it can be, how insulin works. Then he turned the man over to an office nurse who had taken classes to become certified as a diabetes educator. She spent another forty-five minutes having him practice how to draw up and take his insulin, and how to track his sugar levels in a logbook. She set a plan to call him every other day for a week and then, if necessary, bring him back for another review. This would continue until his disease was demonstrably under control. After that, she’d check on him once a month by phone, and Osio would see him every three to four months. The nurse gave him her direct phone number. If he had any problems or questions, she told him, “&lt;em data-reactid=&quot;485&quot;&gt;Llámame&lt;/em&gt;”—call me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;488&quot;&gt;Step by deliberate step, Osio and his team were replacing unnecessary care with the care that people needed. Since 2009, in Hidalgo County, where McAllen is situated, WellMed has contracted with physicians taking care of around fourteen thousand Medicare patients. According to its data, the local WellMed practices have achieved the same results as WellMed has elsewhere: large reductions in overuse of care and better outcomes for patients. Indeed, for the past two years, the top-ranked primary-care doctor out of WellMed’s fifteen hundred—according to a wide range of quality measures, such as the percentage of patients with well-controlled blood pressure and diabetes, rates of emergency-room visits and hospital readmissions, and levels of patient satisfaction—has been a McAllen physician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;490&quot;&gt;I spoke to that doctor, Omar Gomez. He said that he’d set about building a strong team around his patients, and that team included specialists such as cardiologists and surgeons. He encouraged his patients to shift to the ones who, he noticed, didn’t subject them to no-value care. He sat with the specialists, and, he said, “I told them, ‘If my patient &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;492&quot;&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; a cardiac cath—by all means, do it. But if they don’t, then don’t do it. That’s the only thing I ask.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;513&quot;&gt;The passage of the Affordable Care Act, in 2010, created opportunities for physicians to practice this kind of dedicated care. The law allows any group of physicians with five thousand or more Medicare patients to contract directly with the government as an “accountable-care organization,” and to receive up to sixty per cent of any savings they produce. In McAllen, two primary-care groups, with a total of nearly thirteen thousand patients, formed to take advantage of the deal. One, as it happens, was led by Jose Peña, the Doctors Hospital at Renaissance internist. Two years later, Medicare reported that Peña’s team had markedly improved control of its patients’ diabetes; patients also had dramatically lower emergency-room visits and hospital admissions. And the two McAllen accountable-care organizations together managed to save Medicare a total of twenty-six million dollars. About sixty per cent of that went back to the groups. It wasn’t all profit—achieving the results had meant installing expensive data-tracking systems and hiring extra staff. But even after overhead doctors in one group took home almost eight hundred thousand dollars each (some of which they shared with their mid-level staff). It was proving to be a very attractive way to practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; data-reactid=&quot;515&quot; readability=&quot;112&quot;&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;516&quot;&gt;McAllen, in large part because of changes led by primary-care doctors, has gone from a cautionary tale to something more hopeful. Nationwide, the picture is changing almost as fast. Just five years after the passage of health-care reform, twenty per cent of Medicare payments are being made to physicians who have enrolled in alternative-payment programs, whether through accountable-care organizations like those in McAllen or by accepting Walmart-like packaged-price care—known as bundled payment—for spine surgery, joint surgery, and other high-cost procedures. If government targets are met, these numbers will reach thirty per cent of Medicare payments by 2016. A growing number of businesses are also extending the centers-of-excellence approach to their employees, including Boeing, Kohl’s, Lowe’s, and PepsiCo. And a nonprofit in California, the Pacific Business Group on Health, now offers to provide a similar network to any health-care purchaser in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;520&quot;&gt;Could a backlash arrive and halt the trend? It’s a concern. No one has yet invented a payment system that cannot be gamed. If doctors are rewarded for practicing more conservative medicine, some could end up stinting on care. What if Virginia Mason turns away a back-pain patient who should have gone to surgery? What if Dr. Osio fails to send a heart patient to the emergency room when he should have? What if I recommend not operating on a tiny tumor, saying that it is just a turtle, and it turns out to be a rabbit that bounds out of control?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;522&quot;&gt;Proponents point out that people can sue if they think they’ve been harmed, and doctors’ groups can lose their contracts for low-quality scores, which are posted on the Web. But not all quality can be measured. It’s possible that we will calibrate things wrongly, and skate past the point where conservative care becomes inadequate care. Then outrage over the billions of dollars in unnecessary stents and surgeries and scans will become outrage over necessary stents and surgeries and scans that were not performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;524&quot;&gt;Right now, we’re so wildly over the boundary line in the other direction that it’s hard to see how we could accept leaving health care the way it is. Waste is not just consuming a third of health-care spending; it’s costing people’s lives. As long as a more thoughtful, more measured style of medicine keeps improving outcomes, change should be easy to cheer for. Still, when it’s your turn to sit across from a doctor, in the white glare of a clinic, with your back aching, or your head throbbing, or a scan showing some small possible abnormality, what are you going to fear more—the prospect of doing too little or of doing too much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;526&quot;&gt;Mrs. E., my patient with a five-millimetre thyroid nodule that I recommended leaving alone, feared doing too little. So one morning I took her to the operating room, opened her neck, and, in the course of an hour, removed her thyroid gland from its delicate nest of arteries and veins and critical nerves. Given that the surgery posed a greater likelihood of harm than of benefit, some people would argue that I shouldn’t have done it. I took her thyroid out because the idea of tracking a cancer over time filled her with dread, as it does many people. A decade from now, that may change. The idea that we are overdiagnosing and overtreating many diseases, including cancer, will surely become less contentious. That will make it easier to calm people’s worries. But the worries cannot be dismissed. Right now, even doctors are still coming to terms with the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;528&quot;&gt;Other people of a more consumerist bent will be troubled not that I gave her the choice but that she paid virtually none of the expenses incurred by it. The nature of her insurance coverage guaranteed that. Her employer had offered her two options. One was a plan with a high deductible and a medical savings account that would have made her pay a substantial portion of the many-thousand-dollar operation. And this might have made her think harder about proceeding (or, at least, encouraged her to find someone cheaper). But, like many people, she didn’t want to be in that situation. So she chose the second option, which provided full coverage for cases like this one. She found it difficult enough to weigh her fears of the cancer against her fears of the operation—with its risks of life-threatening bleeding and voice damage—without having to put finances into the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;530&quot;&gt;Two hours after the surgery, Mrs. E.’s nurse called me urgently to see her in the recovery room. Her neck was swelling rapidly; she was bleeding. We rushed her back to the operating room and reopened her neck before accumulating blood cut off her airway. A small pumping artery had opened up in a thin band of muscle I’d cauterized. I tied the vessel off, washed the blood away, and took her back to the recovery room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Callout__inset-left___2rZjf&quot; data-type=&quot;callout&quot; data-callout=&quot;inset-left&quot; data-reactid=&quot;532&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO&quot; data-reactid=&quot;542&quot;&gt;“That one looks like a fluorescent light.”&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;550&quot;&gt;I saw her in my office a few weeks later, and was relieved to see she’d suffered no permanent harm. The black and blue of her neck was fading. Her voice was normal. And she hadn’t needed the pain medication I’d prescribed. I arranged for a blood test to check the level of her thyroid hormone, which she now had to take by pill for the rest of her life. Then I showed her the pathology report. She did have a thyroid cancer, a microcarcinoma about the size of this “O,” with no signs of unusual invasion or spread. I wished we had a better word for this than “cancer”—because what she had was not a danger to her life, and would almost certainly never have bothered her if it had not been caught on a scan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;552&quot;&gt;All the same, she thanked me profusely for relieving her anxiety. I couldn’t help reflect on how that anxiety had been created. The medical system had done what it so often does: performed tests, unnecessarily, to reveal problems that aren’t quite problems to then be fixed, unnecessarily, at great expense and no little risk. Meanwhile, we avoid taking adequate care of the biggest problems that people face—problems like diabetes, high blood pressure, or any number of less technologically intensive conditions. An entire health-care system has been devoted to this game. Yet we’re finally seeing evidence that the system can change—even in the most expensive places for health care in the country. ♦&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How the West Got China Wrong</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;LAST weekend China stepped from autocracy into dictatorship. That was when Xi Jinping, already the world’s most powerful man, let it be known that he will change China’s constitution so that he can rule as president for as long as he chooses—and conceivably for life. Not since Mao Zedong has a Chinese leader wielded so much power so openly. This is not just a big change for China (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/news/china/21737543-unhappiness-china-palpable-xi-jinping-decides-abolish-presidential-term-limits&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;), but also strong evidence that the West’s 25-year bet on China has failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the West welcomed the next big communist country into the global economic order. Western leaders believed that giving China a stake in institutions such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO) would bind it into the rules-based system set up after the second world war (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21737558-clear-thinking-and-united-front-are-needed-they-may-not-be-forthcoming-decades&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Briefing&lt;/a&gt;). They hoped that economic integration would encourage China to evolve into a market economy and that, as they grew wealthier, its people would come to yearn for democratic freedoms, rights and the rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a worthy vision, which this newspaper shared, and better than shutting China out. China has grown rich beyond anybody’s imagining. Under the leadership of Hu Jintao, you could still picture the bet paying off. When Mr Xi took power five years ago China was rife with speculation that he would move towards constitutional rule. Today the illusion has been shattered. In reality, Mr Xi has steered politics and economics towards repression, state control and confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;xhead&quot;&gt;All hail, Xi Dada&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with politics. Mr Xi has used his power to reassert the dominance of the Communist Party and of his own position within it. As part of a campaign against corruption, he has purged potential rivals. He has executed a sweeping reorganisation of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), partly to ensure its loyalty to the party, and to him personally. He has imprisoned free-thinking lawyers and stamped out criticism of the party and the government in the media and online. Though people’s personal lives remain relatively free, he is creating a surveillance state to monitor discontent and deviance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China used to profess no interest in how other countries run themselves, so long as it was left alone. Increasingly, however, it holds its authoritarian system up as a rival to liberal democracy. At the party’s 19th congress last autumn, Mr Xi offered “a new option for other countries” that would involve “Chinese wisdom and a Chinese approach to solving the problems facing mankind.” Mr Xi later said that China would not export its model, but you sense that America now has not just an economic rival, but an ideological one, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bet to embed markets has been more successful. China has been integrated into the global economy. It is the world’s biggest exporter, with over 13% of the total. It is enterprising and resourceful, and home to 12 of the world’s 100 most valuable listed companies. It has created extraordinary prosperity, for itself and those who have done business with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet China is not a market economy and, on its present course, never will be. Instead, it increasingly controls business as an arm of state power. It sees a vast range of industries as strategic. Its “Made in China 2025” plan, for instance, sets out to use subsidies and protection to create world leaders in ten industries, including aviation, tech and energy, which together cover nearly 40% of its manufacturing. Although China has become less blatant about industrial espionage, Western companies still complain of state-sponsored raids on their intellectual property. Meanwhile, foreign businesses are profitable but miserable, because commerce always seems to be on China’s terms. American credit-card firms, for example, were let in only after payments had shifted to mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China embraces some Western rules, but also seems to be drafting a parallel system of its own. Take the Belt and Road Initiative, which promises to invest over $1tn in markets abroad, ultimately dwarfing the Marshall plan. This is partly a scheme to develop China’s troubled west, but it also creates a Chinese-funded web of influence that includes pretty much any country willing to sign up. The initiative asks countries to accept Chinese-based dispute-resolution. Should today’s Western norms frustrate Chinese ambition, this mechanism could become an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And China uses business to confront its enemies. It seeks to punish firms directly, as when Mercedes-Benz, a German carmaker, was recently obliged to issue a grovelling apology after unthinkingly quoting the Dalai Lama online. It also punishes them for the behaviour of their governments. When the Philippines contested China’s claim to Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea, China suddenly stopped buying its bananas, supposedly for health reasons. As China’s economic clout grows, so could this sort of pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “sharp power” in commerce is a complement to the hard power of armed force. Here, China behaves as a regional superpower bent on driving America out of East Asia. As with Scarborough Shoal, China has seized and built on a number of reefs and islets. The pace of Chinese military modernisation and investment is raising doubts about America’s long-run commitment to retain its dominance in the region. The PLA still could not defeat America in a fight, but power is about resolve as well as strength. Even as China’s challenge has become overt, America has been unwilling or unable to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;xhead&quot;&gt;Take a deep breath&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to do? The West has lost its bet on China, just when its own democracies are suffering a crisis of confidence. President Donald Trump saw the Chinese threat early but he conceives of it chiefly in terms of the bilateral trade deficit, which is not in itself a threat. A trade war would undermine the very norms he should be protecting and harm America’s allies just when they need unity in the face of Chinese bullying. And, however much Mr Trump protests, his promise to “Make America Great Again” smacks of a retreat into unilateralism that can only strengthen China’s hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead Mr Trump needs to recast the range of China policy. China and the West will have to learn to live with their differences. Putting up with misbehaviour today in the hope that engagement will make China better tomorrow does not make sense. The longer the West grudgingly accommodates China’s abuses, the more dangerous it will be to challenge them later. In every sphere, therefore, policy needs to be harder edged, even as the West cleaves to the values it claims are universal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To counter China’s sharp power, Western societies should seek to shed light on links between independent foundations, even student groups, and the Chinese state. To counter China’s misuse of economic power, the West should scrutinise investments by state-owned companies and, with sensitive technologies, by Chinese companies of any kind. It should bolster institutions that defend the order it is trying to preserve. For months America has blocked the appointment of officials at the WTO. Mr Trump should demonstrate his commitment to America’s allies by reconsidering membership of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, as he has hinted. To counter China’s hard power, America needs to invest in new weapons systems and, most of all, ensure that it draws closer to its allies—who, witnessing China’s resolve, will naturally look to America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rivalry between the reigning and rising superpowers need not lead to war. But Mr Xi’s thirst for power has raised the chance of devastating instability. He may one day try to claim glory by retaking Taiwan. And recall that China first limited the term of its leaders so that it would never again have to live through the chaos and crimes of Mao’s one-man rule. A powerful, yet fragile, dictatorship is not where the West’s China bet was supposed to lead. But that is where it has ended up.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>More art is being produced and sold than ever before, at ever higher prices</title>
<link>https://newrepublic.com/article/147192/modern-art-serves-rich</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://newrepublic.com/article/147192/modern-art-serves-rich</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;content-body&quot; data-reactid=&quot;.2bw6g6w8ox2.2.1.0.0.$0.1.0&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article-text-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article-text-grid&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the late 1950s and 1960s, Robert and Ethel Scull, owners of a lucrative taxi company, became fixtures on the New York gallery circuit, buying up the work of then-emerging Abstract Expressionist, Minimalist, and Pop artists in droves. Described by Tom Wolfe as “the folk heroes of every social climber who ever hit New York”—Robert was a high school drop-out from the Bronx—the Sculls shrewdly recognized that establishing themselves as influential art collectors offered access to the upper echelons of Manhattan society in a way that nouveau riche “taxi tycoon” did not.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;recirc-0&quot; class=&quot;recirc-most-popular pull-right pull-small hide&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, on October 18, 1973, in front of a slew of television cameras and a packed salesroom at the auction house Sotheby Parke Bernet, they put 50 works from their collection up for sale, ultimately netting $2.2 million—an unheard of sum for contemporary American art. More spectacular was the disparity between what the Sculls had initially paid, in some cases only a few years prior to the sale, and the prices they commanded at auction: A painting by Cy Twombly, originally purchased for $750, went for $40,000; Jasper Johns’s &lt;em&gt;Double White Map&lt;/em&gt;, bought in 1965 for around $10,000, sold for $240,000. Robert Rauschenberg, who had sold his 1958 work &lt;em&gt;Thaw&lt;/em&gt; to the Sculls for $900 and now saw it bring in $85,000, infamously confronted Robert Scull after the sale, shoving the collector and accusing him of exploiting artists’ labor. In a scathing essay published the following month in &lt;em&gt;New York&lt;/em&gt; magazine, titled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/arts-letters/blue-chips&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Profit Without Honor&lt;/a&gt;,” the critic Barbara Rose described the sale as the moment “when the art world collapsed.”&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, the Sculls’ auction looks more like the beginning than the end. By today’s standards, the then-record-breaking prices—even adjusted for inflation—sound almost quaint. In November 2013, the Post-War and Contemporary evening sale at Christie’s totaled $691.6 million, setting a new record for the most expensive work by a living artist—$58.4 million for &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/146939/one-of-jeff-koons-balloon-dogs-just-fetched-a-record-price-but-who-owns-the-rest-of-the-litter/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jeff Koons’s sculpture &lt;em&gt;Balloon Dog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Christie’s proceeded to break its own record auction totals twice more in the next year, with the November 2014 Contemporary sale raking in $852.9 million in a single evening. Meanwhile, this past fall, Christie’s sold a recently rediscovered painting attributed to Leonardo da Vinci &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-450-million-leonardo-da-vinci-expensive-artwork-time&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;for upwards of $450 million&lt;/a&gt;, making it the most expensive work ever sold at auction. It’s telling that Christie’s chose to include it in their Post-War and Contemporary sale rather than one devoted to Old Masters where it logically belonged, attesting to the privileged place of contemporary art within today’s art market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullquote pull-right&quot;&gt;What was once a niche trade has expanded into a global industry bound up with luxury, fashion, and celebrity.&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her 2014 book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Big-Bucks-Explosion-Market-Century/dp/184822138X&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Big Bucks: The Explosion of the Art Market in the Twenty-First Century&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the veteran art market reporter Georgina Adam surveyed the forces that propelled the stratospheric rise in the market for contemporary art, attempting to explain why, for instance, one version of Andy Warhol’s 1963 screen print &lt;em&gt;Liz&lt;/em&gt; could sell for $2 million in 1999 and another from the same series for $24 million in 2007, only a few years later. What was once a niche trade overwhelmingly based in the United States and Western Europe has expanded into a global industry bound up with luxury, fashion, and celebrity, attracting an expanded range of ultra-wealthy buyers who aggressively compete for works by brand-name artists. “When I started out, 30 years ago, millionaires had boats and jets—but didn’t necessarily have any art at all,” Thomas Seydoux, the former chairman of Impressionist and Modern art at Christie’s tells Adam. “For the very wealthy today, it’s not fine not to be interested in art.”&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article-text-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article-text-grid&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her follow-up &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Side-Boom-Excesses-Century/dp/1848222203&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dark Side of the Boom: The Excesses of the Art Market in the Twenty-First Century&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Adam, a longtime editor at the &lt;em&gt;Art Newspaper&lt;/em&gt; and contributor to the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;, considers the negative effects this influx of money has had on the art itself. As contemporary art is increasingly viewed as an asset class&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt;alongside equities, bonds, and real estate&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt;Adam sees artworks often used as a vehicle to hide or launder money, and artists encouraged to churn out works in market-approved styles, bringing about a decline in quality.&lt;span&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-break&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Art’s imbrication in networks of money and power is hardly a contemporary phenomenon. Many of the great masterpieces of Renaissance art, for instance, were commissioned by members of the nobility. The origins of the modern picture trade date arguably to the 17th&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;century Dutch Republic, where, in the absence of monarchical or church patronage, artists began producing domestically-scaled genre paintings for sale on the open market. In the early 20th century, the art dealer Joseph Duveen—later the 1st Baron Duveen of Millbank—made a fortune selling Old Master paintings he acquired from cash-poor European aristocrats to wealthy American industrialists like Andrew Mellon. As Duveen famously quipped, “Europe has a great deal of art, and America has a great deal of money.” What has changed is speed and scale: There is, Adam argues, more art being produced and sold than ever before, as artists, galleries, and auction houses attempt to keep up with the demand of a new class of international “UHNWIs,” Ultra High Net Worth Individuals attracted by the lure of profit and prestige.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.newrepublic.com/7305457eda7e45350c69d2f53e44d722715fbf4c.jpeg?w=333&quot; data-serialized=&quot;{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;f57e963b-6dc1-48de-a253-77ed61983067&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;hash&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;7305457eda7e45350c69d2f53e44d722715fbf4c&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;width&amp;quot;:333,&amp;quot;height&amp;quot;:499,&amp;quot;format&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;JPEG&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;isAnimated&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;baseUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;//images.newrepublic.com/&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;src&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;//images.newrepublic.com/7305457eda7e45350c69d2f53e44d722715fbf4c.jpeg&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;meta&amp;quot;:{}}&quot; width=&quot;333&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;DARK SIDE OF THE BOOM: THE EXCESSES OF THE ART MARKET IN THE 21ST CENTURY by Georgina Adam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Lund Humphries , 208 pp., $34.99&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Adam describes, two significant changes at the end of the 20th century set the stage for today’s inflated contemporary art market. The first was the expansion of the base of potential buyers: The fall of communism in Eastern Europe and economic liberalization in countries like China and India created a new wave of billionaires eager to flaunt their wealth. In China, which has consistently ranked among the top three largest art markets by value since 2009, demand has also been boosted by a government-sponsored museum-building boom. Over 1000 new museums, a combination of state-run and private institutions, have opened in the past decade; as of 2017, there were approximately 200 privately owned museums devoted to contemporary art. Crucially, building private museums serves not only as a status symbol for the country’s elite, but a means of gaining state approval for lucrative real estate development deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second major change was the shift away from Old Masters and Impressionists as the core of the auction business. Historically, selling contemporary art had been the province of galleries and private dealers; the work of living artists went to auction only infrequently. But the major auction houses, Sotheby’s and Christie’s, recognized that promoting the contemporary market could open up vast new revenue streams. They began to function more like luxury brands. Christie’s was in fact purchased in 1998 by François Pinault, the owner of the European luxury retail conglomerate Kering whose brands include Gucci, Saint Laurent, and Balenciaga. The houses began aggressively hyping a never-ending flow of new inventory, and with it, a jet-set lifestyle of multi-million dollar auctions, exclusive gallery dinners, and VIP art fair vernissages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auction houses also began to expand into financial services for this expanded range of “UHNWI” clients, offering collectors lines of credit, allowing them to borrow against the value of their collections, and sometimes selling works with third-party guarantees, in which the house effectively pre-sells a lot before the auction and may split some share of the proceeds with the guarantor if it ultimately goes for more than the agreed-upon price. The result is that the prices for contemporary art have risen higher and higher, which in turn attracts new buyers, many of them drawn in by the money alone. “I know some Rothko buyers—some of the key market makers today—who didn’t know who Rothko was until he reached $40 million,” says former Phillips auction house chairman Simon de Pury, quoted in &lt;em&gt;Dark Side of the Boom&lt;/em&gt;. “When they saw a good work could sell in the $40 to $60 million range, they suddenly said, ‘this is really interesting!’”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article-text-grid&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critiques of the art market’s rise often revolve around anxieties about art’s commodification: What happens to the notion of art as a public good when its value is primarily measured in dollars? But that isn’t the only thing at stake. In the book’s final section, Adam examines the ways in which the notoriously secretive art business, coupled with lax regulatory oversight, has enabled vast sums of money to change hands without public scrutiny. She cites a number of high profile scandals involving money laundering, stolen property, and shady self-dealing. There is, for instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/08/the-bouvier-affair&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the so-called “Bouvier Affair,”&lt;/a&gt; a legal dispute between the Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev and the Swiss “Freeport King” Yves Bouvier, the owner of an art shipping and storage empire, which is still unfolding in multiple international jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullquote figure-active pull-left&quot;&gt;The houses began aggressively hyping a never-ending flow of new inventory, and with it, a jet-set lifestyle.&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the doormen in Park Avenue co-op buildings, art shippers are frequently privy to the secrets of the extraordinarily rich. After meeting Rybolovlev in 2002, Bouvier offered to use his connections and insider knowledge to help him build a world-class collection by discreetly locating artworks and negotiating deals. In 2008, in the midst of a messy divorce and facing difficulties with the Russian government, Rybolovlev began pouring money into art with Bouvier’s assistance, shifting some of his wealth into portable assets. It later emerged that Bouvier had charged Rybolovlev multi-million dollar markups on his purchases. In one particularly egregious example, Bouvier charged Rybolovlev $118 million for Modigliani’s 1916 painting &lt;em&gt;Nu couché au coussin bleu&lt;/em&gt;, but had acquired it for only $93.5 million. Rybolovlev accused Bouvier of fraud; Bouvier insisted, as Adam puts it, that “he was acting as a dealer, that this was clear to both sides, and that he was entitled to make what he could.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yet the most troubling examples of the exploitation of art for financial gain are perfectly legal. As Adam outlines, collectors and their agents have continually found creative ways to use their art holdings to defer paying taxes, including the establishment of private museums and foundations, storing artworks in offshore freeports where they can be exchanged without incurring customs duties or VAT, and loopholes in the tax code such as “like-kind” exchanges. Originally set up in the 1920s to aid farmers by enabling them to defer taxes on livestock trades, “like-kind exchanges” are now regularly invoked by art collectors in order to avoid paying taxes on the sale of artworks: So long as a collector uses the proceeds of the sale of one work to purchase another within 180 days, the tax obligation can be perpetually kicked down the road.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-break&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Adam brings both an insider’s perspective and a well-sourced reporter’s eye to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Dark Side of the Boom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, using legal documents, auction records, and firsthand interviews with art-world players to shed light on the seemingly inscrutable workings of the art market and the various tertiary industries—art advisors, investment funds, collection management software, storage, shipping, insurance—that have opportunistically sprung up around it. She opens chapters with scene-setting anecdotes—the unveiling of a freeport in Luxembourg, a lavish party celebrating a new Shanghai art fair—offering a privileged, behind-the-scenes view into the places where art’s value is produced and maintained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while Adam paints a detailed and convincingly dire picture of the art world’s excesses, she never fully probes its implications. Perhaps ironically, its central weakness is her narrow focus on the activities of the art market itself: Her book largely brackets an exploration of the art market from the broader context of rising income inequality, economic exploitation, and staggering concentrations of wealth in the hands of the very few, all of which have enabled activity at the its upper reaches to continue unabated despite global downturns in other financial sectors. According to the sociologist Olav Velthuis, the art market ultimately benefits from an unequal distribution of wealth, as newly minted billionaires turn to blockbuster art purchases as a means of announcing their arrival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the question of where the money comes from and where it ultimately goes is only a passing concern here. It’s no coincidence that the world’s most prominent art collectors include Walmart heiress Alice Walton; the Sackler family; Poju Zabludowicz, whose family fortune has its origins in arms dealing; and hedge fund founder Daniel Och, whose firm paid millions of dollars in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-29/och-ziff-two-executives-sanctioned-by-sec-over-africa-deals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;bribes to government officials&lt;/a&gt; in several African countries in exchange for mining rights. No doubt they’d rather be remembered for their patronage of the arts than for profiteering off human misery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Panera Bread did nothing about its customer data vulnerability for eight months</title>

<description>&lt;ol class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;6ea5&quot; id=&quot;6ea5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf--leading&quot;&gt;First, the proof that I reported this, and the beginning of the timeline. I reported this vulnerability in August 2017, which is shown by the following email exchange with Panera Bread’s Information Security Director, Mike Gustavison. After attempting to contact them through a generic security@panerabread.com email address (which bounced), Twitter and even LinkedIn and email messages to Mike Gustavison (whose information I found on LinkedIn), I was formally introduced by an industry contact who had a mutual connection.&lt;/li&gt;

In which I am accused of being a scam artist after sending a polite email informing a security professional of a security vulnerability in their software. Note that I do not, at any time in any email, solicit services or try to deceive.

I send the encrypted report, then follow up. Notice the days passing.
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*QlMA8eMwEm5v5hEwlmSM5g.png&quot; data-width=&quot;2902&quot; data-height=&quot;1124&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*QlMA8eMwEm5v5hEwlmSM5g.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*QlMA8eMwEm5v5hEwlmSM5g.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Following up again. More days pass. Finally an explicit acknowledgement. Note — still August, 2017.
&lt;p name=&quot;c8b3&quot; id=&quot;c8b3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I want to take a moment to say something important. I have worked internally as a security engineer responsible for fielding random security reports like this from the outside. I have also submitted reports like this to companies, in bug bounties and as a courtesy with no expectation of a reward. I have been on both sides of the table. &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;The response I received is not appropriate whatsoever.&lt;/em&gt; There is never a reason to begin a conversation like that by being so defensive. I know people send lots of superfluous security reports, because I’ve had to receive them. But I’ve never started the conversation by being antagonistic — this is not an excuse for reacting like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;78a6&quot; id=&quot;78a6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Now, after I was reassured this would be fixed, I checked on this vulnerability every month or so because my own data is in there, which means I’m personally affected by it. So I personally know for a fact that it was never patched in the interim. And even if it was, that it would be fixed and inadvertently reintroduced is nearly as bad as not fixing it at all. But I held off on doing anything, deciding to let them proceed. Eight months go by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1f38&quot; id=&quot;1f38&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;2. Fast forward to today. I’m fed up with the lackluster response, so I decided to publish it. First I created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pastebin.com/21H28TA1&quot; data-href=&quot;https://pastebin.com/21H28TA1&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pastebin page&lt;/a&gt; describing the vulnerability, to be used as a proof of concept. Then I email and Twitter DM both Troy Hunt and Brian Krebs with the Pastebin page, asking for their help to escalate this so it would actually be fixed, and telling both that I reported this over six months prior. The Pastebin describes the vulnerabilities as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*z8-mNVEdUmQAe04SQpFYeg.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1906&quot; data-height=&quot;1142&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*z8-mNVEdUmQAe04SQpFYeg.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*z8-mNVEdUmQAe04SQpFYeg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Also for the tech savvy, note `echo -n &quot;my name is Dylan Houlihan helloworldfoobar&quot; | openssl dgst -sha256` =&amp;gt; 7682200f0cd27a4f1a3c2301941d959aae7abf89136c38a4f1ded4d2bb7a67d7
&lt;p name=&quot;dedd&quot; id=&quot;dedd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;So this is just reiterating what I’ve already said at the top of this post. Then I gave two specific API endpoints to illustrate what I’m talking about as a one-click proof of concept:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*t8_QqZ6Fc4_doj7rqbh1FA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1902&quot; data-height=&quot;1004&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*t8_QqZ6Fc4_doj7rqbh1FA.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*t8_QqZ6Fc4_doj7rqbh1FA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*ZuzHSFhG82FF2XfdvmUhQQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1906&quot; data-height=&quot;1016&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*ZuzHSFhG82FF2XfdvmUhQQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ZuzHSFhG82FF2XfdvmUhQQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4ed5&quot; id=&quot;4ed5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;That note there is very important, because it means that you don’t need to target any specific user or interact with them whatsoever to collect this information. You don’t even need to be logged in. You can just increment that number sequentially, and you’ll grab every single user in the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4d64&quot; id=&quot;4d64&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Krebs takes me up on this, and he proceeds to get through to the Chief Information Officer at Panera Bread as a pre-publish courtesy. Then he writes his &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/04/panerabread-com-leaks-millions-of-customer-records/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/04/panerabread-com-leaks-millions-of-customer-records/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*wxZELmkVLthMS1DGi6aZ9A.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1508&quot; data-height=&quot;1408&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*wxZELmkVLthMS1DGi6aZ9A.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*wxZELmkVLthMS1DGi6aZ9A.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;df2e&quot; id=&quot;df2e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;…which led to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*P36V4u9c3hBb0_XclCJhLQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;3360&quot; data-height=&quot;1698&quot; data-is-featured=&quot;true&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*P36V4u9c3hBb0_XclCJhLQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*P36V4u9c3hBb0_XclCJhLQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;47b3&quot; id=&quot;47b3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Panera Bread’s ordering portal was down for an hour to patch the issue. By the time it came back up, news sites were already running with the story based on Krebs’ article and statements from the company. See if you can spot a familiar statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*yb7dIWZLbM2PAuLjzK-Z-A.png&quot; data-width=&quot;2136&quot; data-height=&quot;1122&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*yb7dIWZLbM2PAuLjzK-Z-A.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*yb7dIWZLbM2PAuLjzK-Z-A.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
A company is incompetent enough to leave a gaping hole like this trivially open for eight months after initial notification, yet it’s competent enough to review it logs definitively within two hours of the publicity?
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*D8x4zfPPGg4wS5uTV0nBOQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;2750&quot; data-height=&quot;1380&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*D8x4zfPPGg4wS5uTV0nBOQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*D8x4zfPPGg4wS5uTV0nBOQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Again, “no evidence of intrusion”, which is parroted from Panera Bread.
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*xRy13yaNOubxv39cLz57Dg.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1672&quot; data-height=&quot;1178&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*xRy13yaNOubxv39cLz57Dg.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*xRy13yaNOubxv39cLz57Dg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
This is just incorrect. Most people only ever read the headline, yet this one completely obscures the fact that Panera Bread sat on the vulnerability for eight months.
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*lFORq7L3FUFy3T-ahWPOnQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1646&quot; data-height=&quot;1682&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*lFORq7L3FUFy3T-ahWPOnQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*lFORq7L3FUFy3T-ahWPOnQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
And there it is, in bold letters and emphasized in quotation — “Panera take data security very seriously and this issue is resolved.
&lt;p name=&quot;90e1&quot; id=&quot;90e1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;But it wasn’t resolved! It was clearly, definitively, &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;not resolved,&lt;/em&gt;despite the fact they clearly said it was:&lt;/p&gt;

Note the time (Eastern) — this is well after Panera was back up.
&lt;p name=&quot;b8cc&quot; id=&quot;b8cc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;This discovery made this tweet by Krebs much more interesting:&lt;/p&gt;

So did they just make it up?
&lt;p name=&quot;f7cf&quot; id=&quot;f7cf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Then the flood gates were open. Krebs managed to find several more examples of &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;the same exact vulnerability&lt;/em&gt;, indicating the company had not, in fact, resolved it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;a72b&quot; id=&quot;a72b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;That link demonstrated the same vulnerability, which looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*rNycaA8xeW6egitutPckSw.png&quot; data-width=&quot;3360&quot; data-height=&quot;366&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*rNycaA8xeW6egitutPckSw.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*rNycaA8xeW6egitutPckSw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Huh, doesn’t look quite so fixed to me…

Righteous pun, for what it’s worth.

&lt;p name=&quot;fe82&quot; id=&quot;fe82&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Then Krebs did more digging and found out that this vulnerability extends to an entire other application:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;f485&quot; id=&quot;f485&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;And the absolute kicker! Mike Gustavison, the Director of Information Security who I reported this to, used to work at Equifax from 2009–2013:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;3f94&quot; id=&quot;3f94&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Check it out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*wdKkdnGPEVZqFoG32dmt3A.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1794&quot; data-height=&quot;1658&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*wdKkdnGPEVZqFoG32dmt3A.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*wdKkdnGPEVZqFoG32dmt3A.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;354a&quot; id=&quot;354a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Obviously, Panera Bread couldn’t have known Equifax would be breached in 2013. But after all of the foregoing, does this seem quite so surprising?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0a5e&quot; id=&quot;0a5e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;After Krebs unleashed a flurry of counterexamples disproving that the vulnerability was actually patched, Panera Bread ended up like this again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*P36V4u9c3hBb0_XclCJhLQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;3360&quot; data-height=&quot;1698&quot; data-is-featured=&quot;true&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*P36V4u9c3hBb0_XclCJhLQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*P36V4u9c3hBb0_XclCJhLQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
“Resolved”
&lt;p name=&quot;1a63&quot; id=&quot;1a63&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;But now it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*9IUlBdWU84IhNl3HWFDS7A.png&quot; data-width=&quot;830&quot; data-height=&quot;288&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*9IUlBdWU84IhNl3HWFDS7A.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*9IUlBdWU84IhNl3HWFDS7A.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
“Resolved”
&lt;p name=&quot;faaa&quot; id=&quot;faaa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Originally I was content to wait eight months for Panera to fix this on their own. But this is ridiculous. I’m not going to stand for reporting that sweeps all of this under the rug. While Panera Bread’s website remains down due to several specific examples demonstrating the “resolution” didn’t resolve anything, news reports are not updating this fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f3a7&quot; id=&quot;f3a7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Until we start holding companies more accountable for their public statements with respect to security, we will continue to see statements belying a dismissive indifference with PR speak. In the words of Troy Hunt, when Panera Bread says “We take security seriously”, they mean &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/we-take-security-seriously-otherwise/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/we-take-security-seriously-otherwise/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“We didn’t take it seriously enough.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;26b1&quot; id=&quot;26b1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;UPDATE: This received more attention than I thought! I’d like to take the opportunity to add something to this. It’s easy to bully Panera Bread for this, but in my opinion we need to take Panera Bread’s actions as symptomatic of a much larger issue with security reporting and compliance. This is not a problem unique to any particular type of company. This has happened before and it will continue to happen. The lesson to take from this is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;4b76&quot; id=&quot;4b76&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We could collectively afford to be more critical of companies when they issue reactionary statements to do damage control. We need to hold them to a higher standard of accountability. I honestly don’t know what that looks like for the media, but there has to be a better way to do thorough, comprehensive reporting on this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;0162&quot; id=&quot;0162&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;We need to collectively examine what the incentives are that enabled this to happen. I do not believe it was a singular failure with any particular employee. It’s easy to point to certain individuals, but they do not end up in those positions unless that behavior is fundamentally compatible with the broader corporate culture and priorities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;913b&quot; id=&quot;913b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li graf--trailing&quot;&gt;If you are a security professional, please, I implore you, set up a basic page describing a non-threatening process for submitting security vulnerability disclosures. Make this process obviously distinct from the, “Hi I think my account is hacked” customer support process. Make sure this is immediately read by someone qualified and engaged to investigate those reports, both technically and practically speaking. You do not need to offer a bug bounty or a reward. Just offering a way to allow people to easily contact you with confidence would go a long way.&lt;/li&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Panerabread.com&lt;/strong&gt;, the Web site for the American chain of bakery-cafe fast casual restaurants by the same name, leaked millions of customer records — including names, email and physical addresses, birthdays and the last four digits of the customer’s credit card number — for at least eight months before it was yanked offline earlier today, KrebsOnSecurity has learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data available in plain text from Panera’s site appeared to include records for any customer who has signed up for an account to order food online via panerabread.com. The St. Louis-based company, which has more than 2,100 retail locations in the United States and Canada, allows customers to order food online for pickup in stores or for delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Redacted records from Panera’s site, which let anyone search by a variety of customer attributes, including phone number, email address, physical address or loyalty account number. In this example, the phone number was a main line at an office building where many different employees apparently registered to order food online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KrebsOnSecurity learned about the breach earlier today after being contacted by security researcher &lt;strong&gt;Dylan Houlihan&lt;/strong&gt;, who said he initially notified Panera about customer data leaking from its Web site back on August 2, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long message thread that Houlihan shared between himself and Panera indicates that &lt;strong&gt;Mike Gustavison&lt;/strong&gt;, Panera’s director of information security, initially dismissed Houlihan’s report as a likely scam. A week later, however, those messages suggest that the company had validated Houlihan’s findings and was working on a fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thank you for the information we are working on a resolution,” Gustavison wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_43228&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;lightbox&quot; href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/paneranote.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-43228 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/paneranote.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;430&quot; height=&quot;362&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Panera was alerted about the data leakage in early August 2017, and said it was fixing the problem then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to early this afternoon — exactly eight months to the day after Houlihan first reported the problem — and data shared by Houlihan indicated the site was still leaking customer records in plain text. Worse still, the records could be indexed and crawled by automated tools with very little effort.&lt;span id=&quot;more-43216&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, some of the customer records include unique identifiers that increment by one for each new record, making it potentially simple for someone to scrape all available customer accounts. The format of the database also lets anyone search for customers via a variety of data points, including by phone number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Panera Bread uses sequential integers for account IDs, which means that if your goal is to gather as much information as you can instead about someone, you can simply increment through the accounts and collect as much as you’d like, up to and including the entire database,” Houlihan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked whether he saw any indication that Panera ever addressed the issue he reported in August 2017 until today, Houlihan said no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, the flaw never disappeared,” he said. “I checked on it every month or so because I was pissed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after KrebsOnSecurity spoke briefly with Panera’s chief information officer &lt;strong&gt;John Meister&lt;/strong&gt; by phone today, the company briefly took the Web site offline. As of this publication, the site is back online but the data referenced above no longer appears to be reachable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_43226&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-43226&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/paneradown.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;598&quot; height=&quot;243&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Panera took its site down today after being notified by KrebsOnSecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another data point exposed in these records included the customer’s Panera loyalty card number, which could potentially be abused by scammers to spend prepaid accounts or to otherwise siphon value from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.panerabread.com/en-us/company/meet-mypanera.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Panera customer loyalty accounts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not clear yet exactly how many Panera customer records may have been exposed by the company’s leaky Web site, but incremental customer numbers indexed by the site suggest that number may be higher than seven million. It’s also unclear whether any Panera customer account passwords may have been impacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a written statement, Panera said it had fixed the problem within less than two hours of being notified by KrebsOnSecurity. But Panera did not explain why it appears to have taken the company eight months to fix the issue after initially acknowledging it privately with Houlihan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Panera takes data security very seriously and this issue is resolved,” the statement reads. “Following reports today of a potential problem on our website, we suspended the functionality to repair the issue.  Our investigation is continuing, but there is no evidence of payment card information nor a large number of records being accessed or retrieved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:40 p.m. ET:&lt;/strong&gt; Almost minutes after this story was published, Panera gave a statement to &lt;strong&gt;Fox News&lt;/strong&gt; (no link will be provided) downplaying the severity of this breach, stating that only 10,000 customer records were exposed. Almost in an instant, multiple sources — especially &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/holdsecurity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;@holdsecurity&lt;/a&gt; — pointed out that Panera had basically “fixed” the problem by requiring people to log in to a valid user account at panerabread.com in order to view the exposed customer records (as opposed to letting just anyone with the right link access the records).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequent links shared by Hold Security indicate that this data breach may be far larger than the 7 million customer records initially reported as exposed in this story. The vulnerabilities also appear to have extended to Panera’s commercial division which serves countless catering companies. At last count, the number of customer records exposed in this breach appears to exceed 37 million. Thank you to Panera for pointing out the shortcomings of our research. As of this update, the entire Web site panerabread.com is offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone interested in my response to Panera’s apparent end-run around my reporting, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/briankrebs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;my tweets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;e47e&quot; id=&quot;e47e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The art of “Deep Learning” involves a little bit of hit and try to figure out which are the best parameters to get the highest accuracy for your model. There is some level of black magic associated with this, along with a little bit of theory. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.slavv.com/37-reasons-why-your-neural-network-is-not-working-4020854bd607&quot; data-href=&quot;https://blog.slavv.com/37-reasons-why-your-neural-network-is-not-working-4020854bd607&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;This is a great resource for finding the right parameters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;e54b&quot; id=&quot;e54b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Small devices like Mobile Phones and Rasberry PI have very little memory and computation power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;611f&quot; id=&quot;611f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Training neural networks is done by applying many tiny nudges to the weights, and these small increments typically need floating point precision to work (though there are research efforts to use quantized representations here too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b0a1&quot; id=&quot;b0a1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Taking a pre-trained model and running inference is very different. One of the magical qualities of Deep Neural Networks is that they tend to cope very well with high levels of noise in their inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7561&quot; id=&quot;7561&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Why Quantize?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2179&quot; id=&quot;2179&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Neural network models can take up a lot of space on disk, with the original AlexNet being over 200 MB in float format for example. Almost all of that size is taken up with the weights for the neural connections, since there are often many millions of these in a single model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7ff4&quot; id=&quot;7ff4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The Nodes and Weights of a neural network are originally stored as 32-bit floating point numbers. The simplest motivation for quantization is to shrink file sizes by storing the min and max for each layer, and then compressing each float value to an eight-bit integer.The size of the files is reduced by 75%.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;UN investigators have said the use of Facebook played a &quot;determining role&quot; in stirring up hatred against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the team probing &lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-facebook/u-n-investigators-cite-facebook-role-in-myanmar-crisis-idUKKCN1GO2PN&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;allegations of genocide in Myanmar &lt;/a&gt;said Facebook had &quot;turned into a beast.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 700,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since Myanmar's military launched an operation in August against &quot;insurgents&quot; in Rakhine state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook has said there is &quot;no place for hate speech&quot; on its platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We take this incredibly seriously and have worked with experts in Myanmar for several years to develop safety resources and counter-speech campaigns,&quot; a Facebook spokeswoman told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This work includes a dedicated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/safety/resources/myanmar&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;Safety Page for Myanmar&lt;/a&gt;, a locally illustrated version of our Community Standards, and regular training sessions for civil society and local community groups across the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Of course, there is always more we can do and we will continue to work with local experts to help keep our community safe.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;'Incitement to violence'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UN's Fact-finding Mission on Myanmar announced the interim findings of its investigation on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a press conference the chairman of the mission, Marzuki Darusman, said that social media had &quot;substantively contributed to the level of acrimony&quot; amongst the wider public, against Rohingya Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hate speech is certainly, of course, a part of that,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As far as the Myanmar situation is concerned, social media is Facebook and Facebook is social media.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A colleague acknowledged that the service had helped people in the country communicate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Yanghee Lee, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, added: &quot;We know that the ultra-nationalist Buddhists have their own Facebooks and are really inciting a lot of violence and a lot of hatred against the Rohingya or other ethnic minorities.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm afraid that Facebook has now turned into a beast, and not what it originally intended.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interim report is based on more than 600 interviews with human rights abuse victims and witnesses, which were carried out in Bangladesh, Malaysia and Thailand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition the team has analysed satellite imagery, photographs and video footage taken within Myanmar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;People died from gunshot wounds, often due to indiscriminate shooting at fleeing villagers,&quot; the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Some were burned alive in their homes - often the elderly, disabled and young children. Others were hacked to death.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government of Myanmar has previously said the UN needs to provide &quot;clear evidence&quot; to support allegations of crimes against Rohingya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials have claimed that &quot;clearance operations&quot; against militants responsible for attacks on police stations ended in September, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-41566561&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;but that has been disputed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refugees and human rights organisations, including Amnesty International, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/03/myanmar-military-land-grab-as-security-forces-build-bases-on-torched-rohingya-villages/&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;have accused the military&lt;/a&gt; of carrying out executions, rapes and the burning and bulldozing of hundreds of villages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UN has said that the government has attempted to block its efforts to carry out an independent investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook has previously discussed the problems it has faced trying to tackle hate speech in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last July, it &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/06/hard-questions-hate-speech/&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;gave the example of policing use&lt;/a&gt; of the word &quot;kalar&quot;, which it said could be used both innocuously and as a slur against Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We looked at the way the word's use was evolving, and decided our policy should be to remove it as hate speech when used to attack a person or group, but not in the other harmless use cases,&quot; it explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We've had trouble enforcing this policy correctly recently, mainly due to the challenges of understanding the context; after further examination, we've been able to get it right. But we expect this to be a long-term challenge.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A final report from the UN team is due to be published in September.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Apple Plans to Use Its Own Chips in Macs from 2020, Replacing Intel</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-02/apple-plans-to-move-from-intel-to-own-mac-chips-from-2020</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-02/apple-plans-to-move-from-intel-to-own-mac-chips-from-2020</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAPL:US&quot; title=&quot;Relative value&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Apple Inc.&lt;/a&gt; is planning to use its own chips in Mac computers beginning as early as 2020, replacing processors from &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/INTC:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Profile&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Intel Corp&lt;/a&gt;., according to people familiar with the plans.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The initiative, code named Kalamata, is still in the early developmental stages, but comes as part of a larger strategy to make all of Apple’s devices -- including Macs, iPhones, and iPads -- work more similarly and seamlessly together, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. The project, which executives have approved, will likely result in a multi-step transition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The shift would be a blow to Intel, whose partnership helped revive Apple’s Mac success and linked the chipmaker to one of the leading brands in electronics. Apple provides Intel with about 5 percent of its annual revenue, according to Bloomberg &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/INTC:US&quot; title=&quot;Supply Chain analysis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;supply chain&lt;/a&gt; analysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Intel &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/INTC:US&quot; title=&quot;Graph inter-day price moves&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;shares&lt;/a&gt; dropped as much as 9.2 percent, the biggest intraday drop in more than two years, on the news. They were down 6.4 percent at $48.75 at 3:30 p.m. in New York.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Apple could still theoretically abandon or delay the switch. The company declined to comment. Intel said, “We don’t comment on speculation about our customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Apple, the change would be a defining moment. Intel chips remain some of the only major processor components designed by others inside Apple’s product portfolio. Currently, all iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, and Apple TVs use main processors designed by Apple and based on technology from Arm Holdings Plc. Moving to its own chips inside Macs would let Apple release new models on its own timelines, instead of relying on Intel’s processor roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We think that Apple is looking at ways to further integrate their hardware and software platforms, and they’ve clearly made some moves in this space, trying to integrate iOS and macOS,” said Shannon Cross, an analyst at Cross Research. “It makes sense that they’re going in this direction. If you look at incremental R&amp;amp;D spend, it’s gone into ways to try to vertically integrate their components so they can add more functionality for competitive differentiation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stand Out&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shift would also allow Cupertino, California-based Apple to more quickly bring new features to all of its products and stand out from the competition. Using its own main chips would make Apple the only major PC maker to use its own processors. Dell Technologies Inc., HP Inc., Lenovo Group Ltd., and Asustek Computer Inc. use Intel chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using its own chips, Apple would be able to more tightly integrate new hardware and software, potentially resulting in systems with better battery life -- similar to iPads, which use Apple chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the transition to Apple chips in hardware is planned to begin as early as 2020, the changes to the software side will begin even before that. Apple’s iPhones and iPads with custom chips use the iOS operating system, while Mac computers with Intel chips run on a different system called macOS. Apple has slowly been integrating user-facing features over the past several years, and more recently starting sharing lower-level features like a new file management system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‘Marzipan’ Platform&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the larger initiative to make Macs work more like iPhones, Apple is working on a &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/apple-is-said-to-have-plan-to-combine-iphone-ipad-and-mac-apps&quot; title=&quot;Apple Is Said to Have Plan to Combine IPhone, IPad, Mac Apps (1)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new software platform&lt;/a&gt;, internally dubbed Marzipan, for release as early as this year that would allow users to run iPhone and iPad apps on Macs, Bloomberg News reported last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has also previously released Macs with ARM-based co-processors, which run an iOS-like operating system, for specific functions like security. The latest MacBook Pro and iMac Pro include the co-processors. Apple plans to add that chip to a new version of its Mac Pro, to be released by next year, and new Mac laptops this year, according to a person familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel has dominated computing processors for more than a decade, taking market share from Advanced Micro Devices Inc., its only rival in the market. Intel also designs and builds modem chips for some iPhone models so that they can connect to cellular networks and make calls. While Apple is down the list of computer sellers by unit shipments, it’s third when measured by revenue last year, highlighting the premium status of its products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple’s decision to switch away from Intel in PC’s wouldn’t have a major impact on the chipmaker’s earnings because sales to the iPhone maker only constitute a small amount of its total, said Kevin Cassidy, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus &amp;amp; Co. A bigger concern would be if this represents part of a wider trend of big customers moving to designing their own components, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2005, Apple announced a move to Intel chips in its Macs, an initiative that put former Intel Chief Executive Officer &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/obituaries/paul-s-otellini-who-led-intel-and-saw-it-grow-even-more-dies-at-66.html&quot; title=&quot;Paul Otellini&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Paul Ottelini&lt;/a&gt; on stage with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. It was a partnership that shook up the PC industry and saw Apple shift away from chips co-developed by IBM and Motorola.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple’s current chip designs made their name in thin and light mobile devices. That would indicate Apple will start the transition with laptops before moving the designs into more demanding desktop models. Apple has to walk the fine line of moving away from Intel chips without sacrificing the speed and capabilities of its Macs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decision to go with ARM technology in computers might lend it credibility where it has failed to gain a foothold so far. &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/QCOM:US&quot; title=&quot;Stories on new products&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Qualcomm Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, the biggest mobile phone chip provider, is working with PC makers to introduce new thin and light laptops based on its chips in another attempt to steal share from Intel. Microsoft Corp. is supporting that effort by providing a version of its Windows operating system for ARM technology-based chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel’s dominance of the market has been based on its ability to use leading manufacturing technology to produce processors that are more powerful than those of its competitors. Its would-be rivals haven’t yet produced designs that have displaced Intel’s products when it comes to crunching data quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple’s custom processors have been recently manufactured principally by &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/2330:TT&quot; title=&quot;TSMC in the supply chain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd.&lt;/a&gt; Its decision may signal confidence that TSMC and other suppliers such as Samsung Electronics Co. have closed the gap on Intel’s manufacturing lead and can produce processors that are just as powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

- OpenBSD 6.3 RELEASED -------------------------------------------------

Apr 15, 2018.

We are pleased to announce the official release of OpenBSD 6.3.
This is our 44th release.  We remain proud of OpenBSD's record of more
than twenty years with only two remote holes in the default install.

As in our previous releases, 6.3 provides significant improvements,
including new features, in nearly all areas of the system:

 - Improved hardware support, including:
    o SMP support on OpenBSD/arm64 platforms.
    o VFP and NEON support on OpenBSD/armv7 platforms.

      touchpad controller.
    o New sxitwi(4) driver for two-wire bus found on several Allwinner
      SoCs.
    o New sypwr(4) driver for the Silergy SY8106A regulator.
    o Support for Rockchip RK3328 SoCs has been added to the dwge(4),
      rkgrf(4), rkclock(4) and rkpinctrl(4) drivers.
    o Support for Rockchip RK3288/RK3328 SoCs has been added to the
      rktemp(4) driver.
    o Support for Allwinner A10/A20, A23/A33, A80 and R40/V40 SoCs has
      been added to the sxiccmu(4) driver.
    o Support for Allwinner A33, GR8 and R40/V40 SoCs has been added to
      the sxipio(4) driver.
    o Support for SAS3.5 MegaRAIDs has been added to the mfii(4) driver.
    o Support for Intel Cannon Lake and Ice Lake integrated Ethernet has
      been added to the em(4) driver.
    o cnmac(4) ports are now assigned to different CPU cores for
      distributed interrupt processing.
    o The pms(4) driver now detects and handles reset announcements.
    o On amd64 Intel CPU microcode is loaded on boot and
      installed/updated by fw_update(1).
    o Support the sun4v hypervisor interrupt cookie API, adding support
      for SPARC T7-1/2/4 machines.
    o Hibernate support has been added for SD/MMC storage attached to
      sdhc(4) controllers.
    o clang(1) is now used as the system compiler on armv7, and it is
      also provided on sparc64.

 - vmm(4)/ vmd(8) improvements:
    o Add CD-ROM/DVD ISO support to vmd(8) via vioscsi(4).
    o vmd(8) no longer creates an underlying bridge interface for
      virtual switches defined in vm.conf(5).
    o vmd(8) receives switch information (rdomain, etc) from underlying
      switch interface in conjunction of settings in vm.conf(5).
    o Time Stamp Counter (TSC) support in guest VMs.
    o Support ukvm/Solo5 unikernels in vmm(4).
    o Handle valid (but uncommon) instruction encodings better.
    o Better PAE paging support for 32-bit Linux guest VMs.
    o vmd(8) now allows up to four network interfaces in each VM.
    o Add paused migration and snapshotting support to vmm(4) for AMD
      SVM/RVI hosts.
    o BREAK commands sent over a pty(4) are now understood by vmd(8).
    o Many fixes to vmctl(8) and vmd(8) error handling.

 - IEEE 802.11 wireless stack improvements:
    o The iwm(4) and iwn(4) drivers will automatically roam between
      access points which share an ESSID. Forcing a particular AP's MAC
      address with ifconfig's bssid command disables roaming.
    o Automatically clear configured WEP/WPA keys when a new network
      ESSID is configured.
    o Removed the ability for userland to read configured WEP/WPA keys
      back from the kernel.
    o The iwm(4) driver can now connect to networks with a hidden SSID.
    o USB devices supported by the athn(4) driver now use an open source
      firmware, and hostap mode now works with these devices.

 - Generic network stack improvements:
    o The network stack no longer runs with the KERNEL_LOCK() when IPsec
      is enabled.
    o Processing of incoming TCP/UDP packets is now done without
      KERNEL_LOCK().
    o The socket splicing task runs without KERNEL_LOCK().
    o Cleanup and removal of code in sys/netinet6 since
      autoconfiguration runs in userland now.
    o bridge(4) members can now be prevented to talk to each others with
      the new protected option.
    o The pf divert-packet feature has been simplified. The IP_DIVERTFL
      socket option has been removed from divert(4).
    o Various corner cases of pf divert-to and divert-reply are more
      consistent now.
    o Enforce in pf(4) that all neighbor discovery packets have 255 in
      their IPv6 header hop limit field.
    o New set syncookies option in pf.conf(5).
    o Support for GRE over IPv6.
    o New egre(4) driver for Ethernet over GRE tunnels.
    o Support for the optional GRE key header and GRE key entropy in
      gre(4) and egre(4).
    o New nvgre(4) driver for Network Virtualization using Generic
      Routing Encapsulation.
    o Support for configuring the Don't Fragment flag packets
      encapsulated by tunnel interfaces.

 - Installer improvements:
    o if install.site or upgrade.site fails, notify the user and error
      out after storing rand.seed.
    o allow CIDR notation when entering IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
    o repair selection of a HTTP mirror from the list of mirrors.
    o allow '-' in usernames.
    o ask a question at the end of the install/upgrade process so
      carriage return causes the appropriate action, e.g. reboot.
    o display the mode (install or upgrade) shell prompts as long as no
      hostname is known.
    o correctly detect which interface has the default route and if it
      was configured via DHCP.
    o ensure sets can be read from the prefetch area.
    o ensure URL redirection is effective for entire install/upgrade.
    o add the HTTP proxy used when fetching sets to rc.firsttime, where
      fw_update and syspatch can find and use it.
    o add logic to support RFC 7217 with SLAAC.
    o ensure that IPv6 is configured for dynamically created network
      interfaces like vlan(4).
    o create correct hostname when both domain-name and domain-search
      options are provided in the DHCP lease.

 - Routing daemons and other userland network improvements:
    o bgpctl(8) has a new ssv option which outputs rib entries as a
      single semicolon-separated like for selection before output.
    o slaacd(8) generates random but stable IPv6 stateless
      autoconfiguration addresses according to RFC 7217. These are
      enabled per default in accordance with RFC 8064.
    o slaacd(8) follows RFC 4862 by removing an artificial limitation on
      /64 sized prefixes using RFC 7217 (random but stable) and RFC 4941
      (privacy) style stateless autoconfiguration addresses.
    o ospfd(8) can now set the metric for a route depending on the
      status of an interface.
    o ifconfig(8) has a new staticarp option to make interfaces reply to
      ARP requests only.
    o ipsecctl(8) can now collapse flow outputs having the same source
      or destination.
    o The -n option in netstart(8) no longer messes with the default
      route. It is now documented as well.

 - Security improvements:
    o Use even more trap-sleds on various architectures.
    o More use of .rodata for constant variables in assembly source.
    o Stop using x86 &quot;repz ret&quot; in dusty corners of the tree.
    o Introduce &quot;execpromises&quot; in pledge(2).
    o The elfrdsetroot utility used to build ramdisks and the rebound(8)
      monitoring process now use pledge(2).
    o Prepare for the introduction of MAP_STACK to mmap(2) after 6.3.
    o Push a small piece of KARL-linked kernel text into the random
      number generator as entropy at startup.
    o Put a small random gap at the top of thread stacks, so that
      attackers have yet another calculation to perform for their ROP
      work.
    o Mitigation for Meltdown vulnerability for Intel brand amd64 CPUs.
    o OpenBSD/arm64 now uses kernel page table isolation to mitigate
      Spectre variant 3 (Meltdown) attacks.
    o OpenBSD/armv7 and OpenBSD/arm64 now flush the Branch Target Buffer
      (BTB) on processors that do speculative execution to mitigate
      Spectre variant 2 attacks.
    o pool_get(9) perturbs the order of items on newly allocated pages,
      making the kernel heap layout harder to predict.
    o The fktrace(2) system call was deleted.

 - dhclient(8) improvements:
    o Parsing dhclient.conf(5) no longer leaks SSID strings, strings
      that are too long for the parsing buffer or repeated string
      options and commands.
    o Storing leases in dhclient.conf(5) is no longer supported.
    o 'DENY' is no longer valid in dhclient.conf(5).
    o dhclient.conf(5) and dhclient.leases(5) parsing error messages
      have been simplified and clarified, with improved behaviour in the
      presence of unexpected semicolons.
    o More care is taken to only use configuration information that was
      successfully parsed.
    o '-n' has been added, which causes dhclient(8) to exit after
      parsing dhclient.conf(5).
    o Default routes in options classless-static-routes (121) and
      classless-ms-static-routes (249) are now correctly represented in
      dhclient.leases(5) files.
    o Overwrite the file specified with '-L' rather than appending to
      it.
    o Leases in dhclient.leases(5) now contain an 'epoch' attribute
      recording the time the lease was accepted, which is used to
      calculate correct renewal, rebinding and expiry times.
    o No longer nag about underscores in names violating RFC 952.
    o Unconditionally send host-name information when requesting a
      lease, eliminating the need for dhclient.conf(5) in the default
      installation.
    o Be quiet by default. '-q' has been removed and '-v' added to
      enable verbose logging.
    o Decline duplicate offers for the requested address.
    o Unconditionally go into the background after link-timeout seconds.
    o Significantly reduce logging when being quiet, but make '-v' log
      all debug information without needing to compile a custom
      executable.
    o Ignore 'interface' statements in dhclient.leases(5) and assume all
      leases in the file are for the interface being configured.
    o Display the source of the lease bound to the interface.
    o 'ignore', 'request' and 'require' declarations in dhclient.conf(5)
      now add the specified options to the relevant list rather than
      replacing the list.
    o Eliminate a startup race that could result in dhclient(8) exiting
      without configuring the interface.

 - Assorted improvements:
    o Code reorganization and other improvements to malloc(3) and
      friends to make them more efficient.
    o When performing suspend or hibernate operations, ensure all
      filesystems are properly synchronized and marked clean, or if they
      cannot be put into perfectly clean state on disk (due to
      open+unlinked files) then mark them dirty, so that a failed
      resume/unhibernate is guaranteed to perform fsck(8).
    o acme-client(1) autodetects the agreement URL and follows 30x HTTP
      redirects.
    o Added __cxa_thread_atexit() to support modern C++ tool chains.
    o Added EVFILT_DEVICE support to kqueue(2) for monitoring changes to
      drm(4) devices.
    o ldexp(3) now handles the sign of denormal numbers correctly on
      mips64.
    o New sincos(3) functions in libm.
    o fdisk(8) now ensures the validity of MBR partition offsets entered
      while editing.
    o fdisk(8) now ensures that default values lie within the valid
      range.
    o less(1) now splits only the environment variable LESS on '$'.
    o less(1) no longer creates a spurious file when encountering '$' in
      the initial command.
    o softraid(4) now validates the number of chunks when assembling a
      volume, ensuring the on-disk and in-memory metadata are in sync.
    o disklabel(8) now always offers to edit an FFS partition's fragment
      size before offering to edit the blocksize.
    o disklabel(8) now allows editing the cylinders/group (cpg)
      attribute whenever the partition blocksize can be edited.
    o disklabel(8) now detects ^D and invalid input during (R)esize
      commands.
    o disklabel(8) now detects underflows and overflows when -/+
      operators are used.
    o disklabel(8) now avoids an off-by-one when calculating the number
      of cylinders in a free chunk.
    o disklabel(8) now validates the requested partition size against
      the size of the largest free chunk instead of the total free
      space.
    o Support for dumping USB transfers via bpf(4).
    o tcpdump(8) can now understand dumps of USB transfers in the
      USBPcap format.
    o The default prompts of csh(1), ksh(1) and sh(1) now include the
      hostname.
    o Memory allocation in ksh(1) was switched from calloc(3) back to
      malloc(3), making it easier to recognize uninitialized memory. As
      a result, a history-related bug in emacs editing mode was
      discovered and fixed.
    o New script(1) -c option to run a command instead of a shell.
    o New grep(1) -m option to limit the number of matches.
    o New uniq(1) -i option for case-insensitive comparison.
    o The printf(3) format string is no longer validated when looking
      for % formats. Based on a commit by android and following most
      other operating systems.
    o Improved error checking in vfwprintf(3).
    o Many base programs have been audited and fixed for stale file
      descriptors, including cron(8), ftp(1), mandoc(1), openssl(1),
      ssh(1) and sshd(8).
    o Various bug fixes and improvements in jot(1):
       - Arbitrary length limits for the arguments for the -b, -s, -w
         options were removed.
       - The %F format specifier is now supported and a bug in the %D
         format was fixed.
       - Better code coverage in regression tests.
       - Several buffer overruns were fixed.
    o The patch(1) utility now copes better with git diffs that create
      or delete files.
    o pkg_add(1) now has improved support for HTTP(S) redirectors such
      as cdn.openbsd.org.
    o ftp(1) and pkg_add(1) now support HTTPS session resumption for
      improved speed.
    o mandoc(1) -T ps output file size reduced by more than 50%.
    o syslogd(8) logs if there were warnings during startup.
    o syslogd(8) stopped logging to files in a full filesystem. Now it
      writes a warning and continues after space has been made
      available.
    o vmt(4) now allows cloning and taking disk-only snapshots of
      running guests.

 - OpenSMTPD 6.0.4
    o Add spf walk option to smtpctl(8).
    o Assorted cleanups and improvements.
    o Numerous manual page fixes and improvements.

 - OpenSSH 7.7
    o New/changed features:
       - All: Add experimental support for PQC XMSS keys (Extended
         Hash- Based Signatures) based on the algorithm described in
         &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-xmss-hash-based-s&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-xmss-hash-based-s&lt;/a&gt;
         ignatures-12 The XMSS signature code is experimental and not
         compiled in by default.
       - sshd(8): Add a &quot;rdomain&quot; criteria for the sshd_config Match
         keyword to allow conditional configuration that depends on
         which routing domain a connection was received on (currently
         supported on OpenBSD and Linux).
       - sshd_config(5): Add an optional rdomain qualifier to the
         ListenAddress directive to allow listening on different
         routing domains. This is supported only on OpenBSD and Linux
         at present.
       - sshd_config(5): Add RDomain directive to allow the
         authenticated session to be placed in an explicit routing
         domain. This is only supported on OpenBSD at present.
       - sshd(8): Add &quot;expiry-time&quot; option for authorized_keys files
         to allow for expiring keys.
       - ssh(1): Add a BindInterface option to allow binding the
         outgoing connection to an interface's address (basically a
         more usable BindAddress).
       - ssh(1): Expose device allocated for tun/tap forwarding via a
         new %T expansion for LocalCommand. This allows LocalCommand
         to be used to prepare the interface.
       - sshd(8): Expose the device allocated for tun/tap forwarding
         via a new SSH_TUNNEL environment variable. This allows
         automatic setup of the interface and surrounding network
         configuration automatically on the server.
       - ssh(1)/scp(1)/sftp(1): Add URI support to ssh, sftp and scp,
         e.g. ssh://user@host or s&lt;a href=&quot;ftp://user@host/path&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ftp://user@host/path&lt;/a&gt;. Additional
         connection parameters described in
         draft-ietf-secsh-scp-sftp-ssh-uri-04 are not implemented
         since the ssh fingerprint format in the draft uses the
         deprecated MD5 hash with no way to specify the any other
         algorithm.
       - ssh-keygen(1): Allow certificate validity intervals that
         specify only a start or stop time (instead of both or
         neither).
       - sftp(1): Allow &quot;cd&quot; and &quot;lcd&quot; commands with no explicit path
         argument. lcd will change to the local user's home directory
         as usual. cd will change to the starting directory for
         session (because the protocol offers no way to obtain the
         remote user's home directory). bz#2760
       - sshd(8): When doing a config test with sshd -T, only require
         the attributes that are actually used in Match criteria
         rather than (an incomplete list of) all criteria.
    o The following significant bugs have been fixed in this release:
       - ssh(1)/sshd(8): More strictly check signature types during
         key exchange against what was negotiated. Prevents downgrade
         of RSA signatures made with SHA-256/512 to SHA-1.
       - sshd(8): Fix support for client that advertise a protocol
         version of &quot;1.99&quot; (indicating that they are prepared to
         accept both SSHv1 and SSHv2). This was broken in OpenSSH 7.6
         during the removal of SSHv1 support. bz#2810
       - ssh(1): Warn when the agent returns a ssh-rsa (SHA1)
         signature when a rsa-sha2-256/512 signature was requested.
         This condition is possible when an old or non-OpenSSH agent
         is in use. bz#2799
       - ssh-agent(1): Fix regression introduce in 7.6 that caused
         ssh-agent to fatally exit if presented an invalid signature
         request message.
       - sshd_config(5): Accept yes/no flag options
         case-insensitively, as has been the case in ssh_config(5) for
         a long time. bz#2664
       - ssh(1): Improve error reporting for failures during
         connection. Under some circumstances misleading errors were
         being shows. bz#2814
       - ssh-keyscan(1): Add -D option to allow printing of results
         directly in SSHFP format. bz#2821
       - regress tests: fix PuTTY interop test broken in last
         release's SSHv1 removal. bz#2823
       - ssh(1): Compatibility fix for some servers that erroneously
         drop the connection when the IUTF8 (RFC8160) option is sent.
       - scp(1): Disable RemoteCommand and RequestTTY in the ssh
         session started by scp (sftp was already doing this.)
       - ssh-keygen(1): Refuse to create a certificate with an
         unusable number of principals.
       - ssh-keygen(1): Fatally exit if ssh-keygen is unable to write
         all the public key during key generation. Previously it would
         silently ignore errors writing the comment and terminating
         newline.
       - ssh(1): Do not modify hostname arguments that are addresses
         by automatically forcing them to lower-case. Instead
         canonicalise them to resolve ambiguities (e.g. ::0001 =&amp;gt; ::1)
         before they are matched against known_hosts. bz#2763
       - ssh(1): Don't accept junk after &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; responses to
         hostkey prompts. bz#2803
       - sftp(1): Have sftp print a warning about shell cleanliness
         when decoding the first packet fails, which is usually caused
         by shells polluting stdout of non-interactive startups.
         bz#2800
       - ssh(1)/sshd(8): Switch timers in packet code from using
         wall-clock time to monotonic time, allowing the packet layer
         to better function over a clock step and avoiding possible
         integer overflows during steps.
       - Numerous manual page fixes and improvements.

 - LibreSSL 2.7.2
    o Added support for many OpenSSL 1.0.2 and 1.1 APIs, based on
      observations of real-world usage in applications. These are
      implemented in parallel with existing OpenSSL 1.0.1 APIs -
      visibility changes have not been made to existing structs,
      allowing code written for older OpenSSL APIs to continue working.
    o Extensive corrections, improvements, and additions to the API
      documentation, including new public APIs from OpenSSL that had no
      pre-existing documentation.
    o Added support for automatic library initialization in libcrypto,
      libssl, and libtls. Support for pthread_once or a compatible
      equivalent is now required of the target operating system. As a
      side-effect, minimum Windows support is Vista or higher.
    o Converted more packet handling methods to CBB, which improves
      resiliency when generating TLS messages.
    o Completed TLS extension handling rewrite, improving consistency of
      checks for malformed and duplicate extensions.
    o Rewrote ASN1_TYPE_{get,set}_octetstring() using templated ASN.1.
      This removes the last remaining use of the old M_ASN1_* macros
      (asn1_mac.h) from API that needs to continue to exist.
    o Added support for client-side session resumption in libtls. A
      libtls client can specify a session file descriptor (a regular
      file with appropriate ownership and permissions) and libtls will
      manage reading and writing of session data across TLS handshakes.
    o Improved support for strict alignment on ARMv7 architectures,
      conditionally enabling assembly in those cases.
    o Fixed a memory leak in libtls when reusing a tls_config.
    o Merged more DTLS support into the regular TLS code path, removing
      duplicated code.

developers of OpenBSD.  For information on OpenBSD mailing lists, please
see:

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.OpenBSD.org/mail.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.OpenBSD.org/mail.html&lt;/a&gt;

You are also encouraged to read the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) at:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
- DONATIONS ------------------------------------------------------------

The OpenBSD Project is volunteer-driven software group funded by
donations.  Besides OpenBSD itself, we also develop important software
like OpenSSH, LibreSSL, OpenNTPD, OpenSMTPD, the ubiquitous pf packet
filter, the quality work of our ports development process, and many
others.  This ecosystem is all handled under the same funding umbrella.

We hope our quality software will result in contributions that maintain
our build/development infrastructure, pay our electrical/internet costs,
and allow us to continue operating very productive developer hackathon
events.

All of our developers strongly urge you to donate and support our future
efforts.  Donations to the project are highly appreciated, and are
described in more detail at:

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.OpenBSD.org/donations.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.OpenBSD.org/donations.html&lt;/a&gt;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
- OPENBSD FOUNDATION ---------------------------------------------------

For those unable to make their contributions as straightforward gifts,
the OpenBSD Foundation (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openbsdfoundation.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.openbsdfoundation.org&lt;/a&gt;) is a Canadian
not-for-profit corporation that can accept larger contributions and
issue receipts.  In some situations, their receipt may qualify as a
business expense write-off, so this is certainly a consideration for
some organizations or businesses.

There may also be exposure benefits since the Foundation may be
interested in participating in press releases.  In turn, the Foundation
then uses these contributions to assist OpenBSD's infrastructure needs.
Contact the foundation directors at directors@openbsdfoundation.org for
more information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
- RELEASE SONGS --------------------------------------------------------

Every OpenBSD release is accompanied by artwork and a song.  A song may
be coming for the 6.3 release, but later.  If so, lyrics (and an
explanation) of the song may be found at:

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.OpenBSD.org/lyrics.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.OpenBSD.org/lyrics.html&lt;/a&gt;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
- HTTP/HTTPS INSTALLS --------------------------------------------------

OpenBSD can be easily installed via HTTP/HTTPS downloads.  Typically you
need a single small piece of boot media (e.g., a USB flash drive) and
then the rest of the files can be installed from a number of locations,
including directly off the Internet.  Follow this simple set of
instructions to ensure that you find all of the documentation you will
need while performing an install via HTTP/HTTPS.

1) Read either of the following two files for a list of HTTP/HTTPS
   mirrors which provide OpenBSD, then choose one near you:

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.OpenBSD.org/ftp.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.OpenBSD.org/ftp.html&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/ftplist&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/ftplist&lt;/a&gt;

   As of March 31, 2018, the following HTTP/HTTPS mirror sites have
   the 6.3 release:

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://ftp.eu.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/6.3/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://ftp.eu.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/6.3/&lt;/a&gt;     Stockholm, Sweden
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://ftp.hostserver.de/pub/OpenBSD/6.3/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://ftp.hostserver.de/pub/OpenBSD/6.3/&lt;/a&gt;      Frankfurt, Germany
        &lt;a href=&quot;http://ftp.bytemine.net/pub/OpenBSD/6.3/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://ftp.bytemine.net/pub/OpenBSD/6.3/&lt;/a&gt;        Oldenburg, Germany
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://ftp.fr.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/6.3/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://ftp.fr.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/6.3/&lt;/a&gt;     Paris, France
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/OpenBSD/6.3/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/OpenBSD/6.3/&lt;/a&gt;   Brisbane, Australia
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://ftp.usa.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/6.3/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://ftp.usa.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/6.3/&lt;/a&gt;    CO, USA
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://ftp5.usa.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/6.3/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://ftp5.usa.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/6.3/&lt;/a&gt;   CA, USA
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://mirror.esc7.net/pub/OpenBSD/6.3/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://mirror.esc7.net/pub/OpenBSD/6.3/&lt;/a&gt;        TX, USA
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbsd.cs.toronto.edu/pub/OpenBSD/6.3/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://openbsd.cs.toronto.edu/pub/OpenBSD/6.3/&lt;/a&gt; Toronto, Canada
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://fastly.cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/6.3/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://fastly.cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/6.3/&lt;/a&gt; Global

        The release is also available at the master site:

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/6.3/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/6.3/&lt;/a&gt;        Alberta, Canada

        However it is strongly suggested you use a mirror.

   Other mirror sites may take a day or two to update.

2) Connect to that HTTP/HTTPS mirror site and go into the directory
   pub/OpenBSD/6.3/ which contains these files and directories.
   This is a list of what you will see:

        ANNOUNCEMENT     arm64/           macppc/          src.tar.gz
        Changelogs/      armv7/           octeon/          sys.tar.gz
        README           hppa/            packages/        tools/
        SHA256           i386/            ports.tar.gz     xenocara.tar.gz
        SHA256.sig       landisk/         root.mail
        alpha/           loongson/        sgi/
        amd64/           luna88k/         sparc64/

   It is quite likely that you will want at LEAST the following
   files which apply to all the architectures OpenBSD supports.

        README          - generic README
        root.mail       - a copy of root's mail at initial login.
                          (This is really worthwhile reading).

3) Read the README file.  It is short, and a quick read will make
   sure you understand what else you need to fetch.

4) Next, go into the directory that applies to your architecture,
   for example, amd64.  This is a list of what you will see:

        BOOTIA32.EFI*   bsd*            floppy63.fs     pxeboot*
        BOOTX64.EFI*    bsd.mp*         game63.tgz      xbase63.tgz
        BUILDINFO       bsd.rd*         index.txt       xfont63.tgz
        INSTALL.amd64   cd63.iso        install63.fs    xserv63.tgz
        SHA256          cdboot*         install63.iso   xshare63.tgz
        SHA256.sig      cdbr*           man63.tgz
        base63.tgz      comp63.tgz      miniroot63.fs

   If you are new to OpenBSD, fetch _at least_ the file INSTALL.amd64
   and install63.iso.  The install63.iso file (roughly 346MB in size)
   is a one-step ISO-format install CD image which contains the various
   *.tgz files so you do not need to fetch them separately.

   If you prefer to use a USB flash drive, fetch install63.fs and
   follow the instructions in INSTALL.amd64.

5) If you are an expert, follow the instructions in the file called
   README; otherwise, use the more complete instructions in the
   file called INSTALL.amd64.  INSTALL.amd64 may tell you that you
   need to fetch other files.

6) Just in case, take a peek at:

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.OpenBSD.org/errata.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.OpenBSD.org/errata.html&lt;/a&gt;

   This is the page where we talk about the mistakes we made while
   creating the 6.3 release, or the significant bugs we fixed
   post-release which we think our users should have fixes for.
   Patches and workarounds are clearly described there.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
- X.ORG FOR MOST ARCHITECTURES -----------------------------------------

X.Org has been integrated more closely into the system.  This release
contains X.Org 7.7.  Most of our architectures ship with X.Org, including
amd64, sparc64 and macppc.  During installation, you can install X.Org
quite easily.  Be sure to try out xenodm(1), our new, simplified X11
display manager forked from xdm(1).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
- PACKAGES AND PORTS ---------------------------------------------------

Many third party software applications have been ported to OpenBSD and
can be installed as pre-compiled binary packages on the various OpenBSD
architectures.  Please see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq15.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq15.html&lt;/a&gt; for
more information on working with packages and ports.

Note: a few popular ports, e.g., NSD, Unbound, and several X
applications, come standard with OpenBSD and do not need to be installed
separately.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
- SYSTEM SOURCE CODE ---------------------------------------------------

The source code for all four subsystems can be found in the
pub/OpenBSD/6.3/ directory:

        xenocara.tar.gz     ports.tar.gz   src.tar.gz     sys.tar.gz

The README (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ftp.OpenBSD.org/pub/OpenBSD/6.3/README&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://ftp.OpenBSD.org/pub/OpenBSD/6.3/README&lt;/a&gt;) file
explains how to deal with these source files.

<title>Grindr Shares Personal Information With Third-Parties</title>

&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SVT and SINTEF conducted an experiment the 7th of February 2018 to analyse privacy leaks in the dating application Grindr. This was realised for the Sweedish TV program &quot;Plus granskar&quot;, that you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.svtplay.se/video/17267438/plus-granskar/plus-granskar-ditt-karleksliv-en-handelsvara&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;may watch online.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discovered that Grindr contains many trackers, and shares personal information with various third parties directly from the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Grindr Shares Personal Information With Third-Parties&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Grindr Shares Personal Information Including HIV Status With Apptimize And Localytics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unnecessary for Grindr to track its users HIV Status using third-parties services. Moreover, these third-parties are not necessarily certified to host medical data, and Grindr's users may not be aware that they are sharing such data with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Grindr Shares Personal Information Without Security&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal information is shared unencrypted, allowing people, companies, or governments to listen on a network to discover who is using Grindr, where they are precisely located during a day, how do they look, what do they like, what do they browse… By sharing such information in an unsafe way, Grindr is exposing its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Grindr Contains Trackers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By decompiling the Grindr Android source code, we discovered tracking software. Notably Facebook, Smatoop or Localytics. &lt;a href=&quot;https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/reports/5323/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This is also confirmed by the project Exodus.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Experiment Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We installed Grindr on a Samsung Galaxy running Android and on an iPhone running iOS. Two persons created a Grindr profile and started dating for a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analysed the Grindr network traffic by using a man-in-the-middle proxy recording HTTP and HTTPS exchanges, using a setup similar to the one described in the paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://techscience.org/a/2015103001/download.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;Who knows what about me? A survey of behind the scenes personal data sharing to third parties by mobile apps.&quot; (Zang, K., Dummit, J., Graves, P.L. and Latanya, S. - Technology Science (2015).&quot;&lt;/a&gt; We used Wireshark to monitor all TCP/IP traffic, Fiddler to capture HTTP and HTTPS traffic, and APKTool to decompile the Android application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Raw Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find this experiment's HTTP and HTTPS raw data in this repository.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Sinclair Made Dozens of Local News Anchors Recite the Same Script</title>

<description>&lt;p itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;How America's largest local TV owner turned its news anchors into soldiers in Trump's war on the media: &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/iLVtKRQycL&quot;&gt;https://t.co/iLVtKRQycL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/dMdSGellH3&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/dMdSGellH3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;So funny to watch Fake News Networks, among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with, criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased. Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC, which is a total joke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<og:title>Sinclair Made Dozens of Local News Anchors Recite the Same Script</og:title>
<og:description>Last month, anchors at local news stations across the country made identical comments about media bias. The script came from their owner, Sinclair Broadcast Group.</og:description>

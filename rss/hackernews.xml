<title>MacOS finally gains external GPU support</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/30/macos-finally-gains-external-gpu-support/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/30/macos-finally-gains-external-gpu-support/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The latest update to macOS provides support for external graphics card. &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/apple/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;apple&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; announced this would hit the OS last June at WWDC and now it’s finally here. The update allows Mac users to increase the graphical processing power through an external graphics card connected through Thunderbolt 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perviously users had to buy an eGPU dev kit from Apple or employ unofficial means to enable external graphics cards, which meant Apple wouldn’t bail them out if something happened. The additional horsepower isn’t needed for general use, but the added graphics cards supercharge Macs for VR rendering and gaming. Only a handful of eGPUs are compatible with macOS so choose carefully before adding one to your rig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feature comes from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1959?locale=en_US&quot;&gt;High Sierra 10.13.4 Combo Update&lt;/a&gt; which also adds Business Chat in Messages, a new iTunes and a super handy feature to Safari in which users can jump to the right-most open tab by using Command+9.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>NHL stunner: A 36-year-old accountant who has never played pro stars in win</title>
<link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/03/30/nhl-stunner-a-36-year-old-accountant-whos-never-played-pro-stars-in-blackhawks-win/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/03/30/nhl-stunner-a-36-year-old-accountant-whos-never-played-pro-stars-in-blackhawks-win/</guid>
<description>&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;1&quot;&gt;On Thursday night in the middle of a National Hockey League game between the Chicago Blackhawks and the Winnipeg Jets, an unfamiliar figure in a No. 90 Blackhawks jersey stepped onto the ice at the United Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;2&quot;&gt;“Hey, who’s this guy?” an announcer joked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;3&quot;&gt;That guy was Scott Foster, the team’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2018/03/29/emergency-g-pressed-into-action-in-blackhawks-win/33408007/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;emergency goalie&lt;/a&gt;, a 36-year-old accountant who hadn’t played in a high-stakes hockey game in more than 10 years. He played hockey for Western Michigan University &lt;a href=&quot;http://wmubroncos.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=308&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;from 2002 to 2005&lt;/a&gt; and plays in an amateur league, albeit a high-level one composed of former college and professional players. His venue most of the time is not the Blackhawks’ United Center, with a capacity of 23,000, but Johnny’s Ice House in Chicago’s elite league.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Foster has never played in the NHL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Less than 15 minutes after he took the ice, the Blackhawks came away with a 6-2 victory, and Foster emerged a hockey hero, delivering a performance that left everyone who watched it in awe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-elm-loc=&quot;6&quot; class=&quot;col-print-12&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;element element-oembed&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Scott Foster is officially somehow the most improbable, unlikely story in Chicago sports in March, knocking off Loyola's run to the Final Four. An accountant who plays in a beer league coming in and playing goalie and shutting down an actual NHL team for more than half a period.&lt;/p&gt;
— Matt Lindner (@mattlindner) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattlindner/status/979557089868697600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 30, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;7&quot;&gt;How did the father of two and amateur player end up trending on Twitter and stealing the spotlight from fellow Blackhawk Brent Seabrook, who &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/22960742/chicago-blackhawks-defenseman-brent-seabrook-plays-1000th-nhl-game&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;played&lt;/a&gt; his 1,000th-regular-season game that same night?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;8&quot;&gt;Foster is one of a small group of “emergency backup” goaltenders who are kept on hand, usually in the press box or the stands, in the highly unlikely event both regular goalies on the roster are hurt or otherwise unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;9&quot;&gt;“Among hockey’s great quirks,” as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thehockeynews.com/news/article/the-inside-story-on-the-oddity-that-is-the-emergency-backup-goalie-and-why-it-could-soon-change&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hockey News&lt;/a&gt; explained, “is that it’s the only pro sport with the potential for someone not on the roster to come out of the stands and actually play in the game.” But, “it takes a very rare set of circumstances to open that door.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;10&quot;&gt;Hours before the game, goaltender Anton Forsberg injured himself during a morning practice, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/hockey/blackhawks/ct-spt-blackhawks-collin-delia-debut-notes-20180329-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chicago Tribune.&lt;/a&gt; Down to one goalie, rookie Collin Delia, the Blackhawks &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NHLBlackhawks/status/979516399075905537&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; Foster as an emergency backup. Delia got hurt. Foster was told to put on his helmet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;11&quot;&gt;Here’s a sampler of the play-by-play that followed from the Blackhawks Twitter account:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div data-elm-loc=&quot;15&quot; class=&quot;col-print-12&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;element element-oembed&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;HORN! Emergency goaltender Scott Foster, everyone! &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/HAWKSWIN?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#HAWKSWIN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Chicago Blackhawks (@NHLBlackhawks) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NHLBlackhawks/status/979557417456488449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 30, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;16&quot;&gt;This isn’t the first time Foster has been tapped for the emergency backup role. In a postgame &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RB60iaSUIu0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;, he said he had been designated as the emergency goalie for 12 or 15 games this season, but his usual duties involved sitting in the press box and taking advantage of the free food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;17&quot;&gt;So imagine his surprise when he learned that Delia — in the midst of his own &lt;a href=&quot;https://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/from-the-echl-to-the-nhl-its-been-quite-a-season-for-blackhawks-collin-delia/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NHL debut&lt;/a&gt; — had suffered an injury in the third period, and he was needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;18&quot;&gt;“The initial shock happened when I had to dress, and then, I think, you just kind of black out after that,” Foster said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;19&quot;&gt;The cameras &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NHLBlackhawks/status/979553463603466241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fsports%2Fnhl%2F2018%2F03%2F29%2Femergency-g-pressed-into-action-in-blackhawks-win%2F33408007%2F&amp;amp;tfw_creator=usatoday&amp;amp;tfw_site=usatoday&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;trained&lt;/a&gt; on him as he made his way past a bemused Joel Quenneville, the Blackhawks’ coach, and other players. Despite wearing his hockey helmet, his eyes seemed to show bewilderment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;20&quot;&gt;When asked if he received any advice before his big moment, Foster said, “I don’t think I heard anything other than ‘Put your helmet on.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;21&quot;&gt;It turns out no advice was needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;22&quot;&gt;Foster was an impenetrable wall, stopping all seven of the shots he faced, the Chicago Sun-Times &lt;a href=&quot;https://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/dylan-sikura-alex-debrincat-blackhawks-debut-2018/amp/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;23&quot;&gt;In the 14 minutes and one second that Foster played, the Internet went wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;24&quot;&gt;His spotless performance stunned fans, with Sun-Times reporter Satchel Price &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SatchelPrice/status/979554775338496000&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tweeting&lt;/a&gt; an all-caps reminder that Foster had “NEVER PLAYED PRO HOCKEY.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;25&quot;&gt;His own recreational league chimed in, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/johnnysicehouse/status/979557036211015680&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tweeting&lt;/a&gt; their support for the burgeoning star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;27&quot;&gt;His feat even earned him the team belt, which is awarded to the player of the game, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wcvb.com/article/emergency-goalie-pressed-into-action-in-blackhawks-win/19637713&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WCVB.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;29&quot;&gt;“This is something that no one can ever take away from me,” Foster said. “It’s something that I can go home and tell my kids.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;30&quot;&gt;In an instant, Foster became an icon for adult recreational hockey players who imagine themselves playing in the NHL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;31&quot;&gt;On Twitter, a user &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JayDupes/status/979622200146911233&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Foster “is why we all keep plugging away in beer leagues and pick up games.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;32&quot;&gt;His story was even &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TFroehlig/status/979578688139382784&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;compared&lt;/a&gt; to other inspirational sports moments, like Daniel “Rudy” Ruettiger &lt;a href=&quot;http://bleacherreport.com/articles/328263-the-true-story-of-notre-dames-famous-walk-on-daniel-rudy-reutigger&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;taking&lt;/a&gt; the field with the Notre Dame Fighting Irish in 1975.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-elm-loc=&quot;33&quot; class=&quot;col-print-12&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;element element-oembed&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This Scott Foster story is incredible, once-in-a-lifetime stuff, like the movie &quot;Rudy.&quot; You've never played pro hockey. You're 36. Yet the stars aligned in spectacular fashion Thursday night. This is generational storytime stuff you can't make up. This happened, folks. It's nuts!&lt;/p&gt;
— Tim Froehlig (@TFroehlig) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TFroehlig/status/979578688139382784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 30, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;34&quot;&gt;Despite his newfound fame, Foster said he still has to go back to his day job, where he will trade his Blackhawks jersey for a button-down shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;35&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Who would have thought?” he said to reporters after the game. “You just keep grinding away in men’s league, and eventually you get your shot.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Giraffes Added to the Endangered Species List</title>
<link>https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/giraffes-silently-slip-endangered-species-list-180961372/#pjgVVUWGgDD6WdVV.01?no-ist</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/giraffes-silently-slip-endangered-species-list-180961372/#pjgVVUWGgDD6WdVV.01?no-ist</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;101.84623270118&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iucn.org/news/new-bird-species-and-giraffe-under-threat-%E2%80%93-iucn-red-list&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;International Union for the Conservation of Nature&lt;/a&gt;, the body that administers the world’s official endangered species list, announced yesterday that it was moving the giraffe from a species of Least Concern to Vulnerable status in its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iucnredlist.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Red List of Threatened Species report&lt;/a&gt;. That means the animal faces extinction in the wild in the medium-term future if nothing is done to minimize the threats to its life or habitat. The next steps are endangered, critically endangered, extinct in the wild and extinct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poaching of elephants and rhinoceros and the illegal trade in pangolins has overshadowed the problems with giraffes in the last decade. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/08/giraffe-red-list-vulnerable-species-extinction&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Damian Carrington at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports that giraffe numbers have dropped precipitously in the last 31 years, from 157,000 individuals in 1985 to 97,500 at last count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whilst giraffes are commonly seen on safari, in the media and in zoos, people—including conservationists—are unaware that these majestic animals are undergoing a silent extinction,” Julian Fennessy, the co-chair of the IUCN's Species Survival Commission's Giraffe and Okapi Specialist Group says in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iucn.org/news/new-bird-species-and-giraffe-under-threat-%E2%80%93-iucn-red-list&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. “With a decline of almost 40 percent in the last three decades alone, the world's tallest animal is under severe pressure in some of its core ranges across East, Central and West Africa. As one of the world's most iconic animals, it is timely that we stick our neck out for the giraffe before it is too late.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The giraffes face two main threats, encroachment from cities and towns into their habitat and poaching. Poaching has become increasingly problematic. Some food insecure villagers kill the animals for their meat, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/08/wildlife-giraffes-garamba-national-park-poaching-tails/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jani Actman at &lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports many giraffes are slaughtered just for their tails, which are considered a status symbol and have been used as a dowry when asking a bride’s father for his daughters hand in marriage in some cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/08/science/giraffe-extinction.html?_r=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Patrick Healy at &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports that red list divides the giraffe into nine subspecies. Five of those subspecies are decreasing in numbers while two populations are increasing and one is stable. West African giraffes, the smallest subspecies, have grown from 50 individuals in the 1990s to about 400 today. But that success took &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/extinction-countdown/nearly-extinct-giraffe-subspecies-enjoys-conservation-success/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a massive amount of effort from the government of Niger and conservation groups&lt;/a&gt;.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will take similar efforts throughout the giraffe's wide range to arrest its plummeting numbers. Derek Lee, founder of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wildnatureinstitute.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wild Nature Institute&lt;/a&gt; who contributed to the IUCN update tells Healy that both poaching and habitat encroachment need to be stopped to save the giraffe. “These are problems everywhere for giraffes,” he says. “You need to stop both threats.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While increasing funding for anti-poaching efforts can do some good, Lee thinks stopping habitat encroachment is a much more difficult prospect, since it would mean interfering with land development, mining and other economic activities and livelihoods.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem for giraffes, though, may be the lack of attention over the years. “I am absolutely amazed that no one has a clue,” Julian Fennessy, executive director of Giraffe Conservation Foundation tells &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/06/18/sir-david-attenborough-giraffes-are-facing-silent-extinction/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sarah Knapton at &lt;em&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This silent extinction. Some populations less than 400. That is more endangered than any gorilla, or almost any large mammal in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s a strong tendency to think that familiar species (such as giraffes, chimps, etc.) must be OK because they are familiar and we see them in zoos,” Duke University conservation biologist Stuart Pimm, tells the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/12/08/giraffe-extinction-list-threatened-endangered-species/95128734/&quot;&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, giraffes have silently been going extinct across Africa over the last century. The animal is already gone from seven countries, Burkina Faso, Eritrea, Guinea, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria and Senegal.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Mailchimp Is Shutting Down ICO and Blockchain-Related Emails</title>
<link>https://futurism.com/mailchimp-is-shutting-down-ico-and-blockchain-related-emails-and-people-are-freaking-out/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://futurism.com/mailchimp-is-shutting-down-ico-and-blockchain-related-emails-and-people-are-freaking-out/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Consider this a shot across the bow of the entire ICO and blockchain-related sector: email marketing service Mailchimp recently enacted a policy shutting off Blockchain and ICO related accounts. Now, the first victims of this policy are getting the news, and responding in kind by attempting to read the riot act to &lt;a href=&quot;https://mailchimp.com/about/brand-assets/&quot;&gt;a Twitter account whose avatar is a monkey with a hat.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mailchimp announced the policy by alerting its customers on Thursday over email. Its customers freaked out. Like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;500&quot; readability=&quot;8.8679245283019&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;So &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MailChimp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@MailChimp&lt;/a&gt; is closing the Week In Ethereum account in four weeks because they hate blockchains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Centralized capricious power is exactly why we need blockchains&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— Evan Van Ness (@evan_van_ness) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/evan_van_ness/status/979485548476710912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 29, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reached out to Mailchimp to see what the deal was. A rep for the company explained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re looking into this particular account, but if an account holder believes there’s been a mistake, they are encouraged to reach out to with the details, and MailChimp’s Legal team will take a closer look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company then reiterated its updated Acceptable Use Policy, which states that the company “does not allow businesses involved in any aspect of the sale, transaction, exchange, storage, marketing, or production of cryptocurrencies, virtual currencies, and any digital assets related to an Initial Coin Offering, to use MailChimp to facilitate or support any of those activities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words: If you’re making money on an ICO or blockchain, you won’t be doing it on Mailchimp. But talking about blockchain or ICOs? Totally fine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The promotion and exchange of cryptocurrencies is too frequently associated with scams, fraud, phishing, and potentially misleading business practices at this time. It’s important to note that this update to our policy does not prevent the discussion of related topics in messages sent through our platform. For example, journalists and publications may send cryptocurrency-related information as long as they’re not involved in the production, sale, exchange, storage, or marketing of cryptocurrencies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it’s not that they hate blockchain or your specific ICO, they just hate the con artists:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We recognize that blockchain technology is in its infancy and has tremendous potential. Nonetheless…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nonetheless&lt;/em&gt;, indeed! We asked a few more questions about how MailChimp can actually delineate between emails from people involved in the shilling and profiteering of blockchain and ICOs versus people having news-related discussions of blockchain and ICOs (because, LOL, in the current moment, most non-algorithmic &lt;em&gt;humans &lt;/em&gt;have a justifiably tough time distinguishing between the two). We’ll update here if they respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, it’ll be a hell of a lot of fun to watch (1) which companies follow MailChimp’s lead, (2) which companies capitalize off of the fact that they nixed this entire segment of people from their platform and go all in on blockchain, sweeping ’em up in Mailchimp’s place, and (3) watching all of blockchain and ICO Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=mailchimp%20censorship&amp;amp;src=typd&quot;&gt;collectively lose their minds&lt;/a&gt; about feeling censored and repressed. Confidential to everyone in crypto: Mailchimp isn’t the Democratic Republic of North Korea (which you don’t live in).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re not even the only email marketing company in the world! It’s just the only one with &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/298094/how-mailchimps-irresistible-serial-ad-became-the-years-biggest-marketing-win/&quot;&gt;adorable and ubiquitous podcast mid-roll ads&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll live another day, we swear.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Poor Grades Tied to Class Times That Don’t Match Our Biological Clocks</title>
<link>http://news.berkeley.edu/2018/03/29/social-jetlag/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://news.berkeley.edu/2018/03/29/social-jetlag/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It may be time to tailor students’ class schedules to their natural biological rhythms, according to a new study from UC Berkeley and Northeastern Illinois University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_67378&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SleepingStudent300.jpg&quot; data-rel=&quot;lightbox-0&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-67378&quot; src=&quot;https://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SleepingStudent300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; srcset=&quot;http://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SleepingStudent300.jpg 300w, http://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SleepingStudent300-150x150.jpg 150w, http://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SleepingStudent300-275x275.jpg 275w, http://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SleepingStudent300-32x32.jpg 32w, http://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SleepingStudent300-50x50.jpg 50w, http://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SleepingStudent300-64x64.jpg 64w, http://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SleepingStudent300-96x96.jpg 96w, http://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SleepingStudent300-128x128.jpg 128w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Students’ biological clocks often conflict with their class schedules, negatively impacting their academic performance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers tracked the personal daily online activity profiles of nearly 15,000 college students as they logged into campus servers. After sorting the students into “night owls,” “daytime finches” and “morning larks” — based on their activities on days they were not in class — researchers compared their class times to their academic outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their findings, published today in the journal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/srep/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, show that students whose circadian rhythms were out of sync with their class schedules – say, night owls taking early morning courses – received lower grades due to “social jet lag,” a condition in which peak alertness times are at odds with work, school or other demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We found that the majority of students were being jet-lagged by their class times, which correlated very strongly with decreased academic performance,” said study co-lead author Benjamin Smarr, a postdoctoral fellow who studies circadian rhythm disruptions in the lab of UC Berkeley psychology professor &lt;a href=&quot;https://psychology.berkeley.edu/people/lance-kriegsfeld&quot;&gt;Lance Kriegsfeld&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to learning deficits, social jet lag has been tied to obesity and excessive alcohol and tobacco use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a positive note: “Our research indicates that if a student can structure a consistent schedule in which class days resemble non-class days, they are more likely to achieve academic success,” said study co-lead author Aaron Schirmer, an associate professor of biology at Northeastern Illinois University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not only night owls at risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While students of all categories suffered from class-induced jet lag, the study found that night owls were especially vulnerable, many appearing so chronically jet-lagged that they were unable to perform optimally at any time of day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_67386&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SJL-2-400.jpg&quot; data-rel=&quot;lightbox-1&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-67386 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SJL-2-400.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; srcset=&quot;http://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SJL-2-400.jpg 400w, http://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SJL-2-400-150x150.jpg 150w, http://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SJL-2-400-275x275.jpg 275w, http://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SJL-2-400-32x32.jpg 32w, http://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SJL-2-400-50x50.jpg 50w, http://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SJL-2-400-64x64.jpg 64w, http://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SJL-2-400-96x96.jpg 96w, http://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SJL-2-400-128x128.jpg 128w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Owls performed worst of all the groups due to chronic social jet lag (Image courtesy of Benjamin Smarr).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s not as simple as students just staying up too late, Smarr said&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because owls are later and classes tend to be earlier, this mismatch hits owls the hardest, but we see larks and finches taking later classes and also suffering from the mismatch,” said Smarr. “Different people really do have biologically diverse timing, so there isn’t a one-time-fits-all solution for education.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what is thought to be the largest-ever survey of social jet lag using real-world data, Smarr and Schirmer analyzed the online activity of 14,894 Northeastern Illinois University students as they logged in and out of the campus’s learning management system over two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To separate the owls from the larks from the finches, and gain a more accurate alertness profile, the researchers tracked students’ activity levels on days that they did not attend a class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Majority out of sync with class times&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, they looked at how larks, finches and owls had scheduled their classes during four semesters from 2014 to 2016 and found that about 40 percent were mostly biologically in sync with their class times. As a result, they performed better in class and enjoyed higher GPAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_67385&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SJL-1-400.jpg&quot; data-rel=&quot;lightbox-2&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-67385&quot; src=&quot;https://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SJL-1-400.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; srcset=&quot;http://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SJL-1-400.jpg 400w, http://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SJL-1-400-314x275.jpg 314w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trajectory on left tracks performance (GPA) of students whose alertness peaks before class times while the right side tracks performance of students whose alertness peaks after class times. (Image courtesy of Benjamin Smarr)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, 50 percent of the students were taking classes before they were fully alert, and another 10 percent had already peaked by the time their classes started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have found that older people tend to be active earlier while young adults shift to a later sleep-wake cycle during puberty. Overall, men stay up later than women, and circadian rhythms shift with the seasons based on natural light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding these patterns reflected in students’ login data spurred researchers to investigate whether digital records might also reflect the biological rhythms underlying people’s behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that “rather than admonish late students to go to bed earlier, in conflict with their biological rhythms, we should work to individualize education so that learning and classes are structured to take advantage of knowing what time of day a given student will be most capable of learning,” Smarr said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;take-back-the-power-and-the-responsibilities&quot;&gt;Take back the power… and the responsibilities!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PeerTube isn’t a single video hosting platform with a single group of rules: it’s a network of dozens of interconnected hosting providers, and each provider is composed of different people and administrators. You don’t like some of the rules? You’re free to join the hosting provider of your choice, or even better, be your own hosting provider with your own rules!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-8 col-sm-push-4&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;take-control-of-your-content&quot;&gt;Take control of your content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PeerTube allows you to share all your videos. Being in direct contact with a human hosting provider (or becoming your own) allows you to choose how their broadcasting is done. Your videos will benefit from tools to fill description, categorization, choosing a preview image and marking videos as not safe for work. Tweaking the &lt;strong&gt;Support&lt;/strong&gt; button will allow you to show your audience how you want them to support your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re a person, not a product. PeerTube is a free/libre software financed by a French non-profit organization: &lt;a href=&quot;https://soutenir.framasoft.org/association&quot;&gt;Framasoft&lt;/a&gt;. All instances are created, animated, moderated and maintained independently. PeerTube isn’t submitted by any company monopole, doesn’t depend on ads and doesn’t track you. With PeerTube you’re not a product: PeerTube is at your service, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you watch a video with PeerTube, the WebTorrent technology allows you to be part of the broadcasting of this video with the viewers who are watching it at the same time. This video stream sharing allows a healthier distribution of exchanges on the network. Moreover, the federation protocol (ActivityPub) allows to publish the videos and comments on other platforms that support it, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://joinmastodon.org&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;! (experimental)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Internal Facebook posts of employees discussing leaked memo</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/30/17179100/facebook-memo-leaks-boz-andrew-bosworth</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/30/17179100/facebook-memo-leaks-boz-andrew-bosworth</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;pVGdKN&quot;&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanmac/growth-at-any-cost-top-facebook-executive-defended-data?utm_term=.ul2zGPzO8#.uy859R5vP&quot;&gt;publication of a June 2016 memo describing the consequences of Facebook’s growth-at-all-costs&lt;/a&gt; triggered an emotional conversation at the company today. An internal post reacting to the memo found employees angry and heartbroken that their teammates were sharing internal company discussions with the media. Many called on the company to step up its war on leakers and hire employees with more “integrity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;R61K2D&quot;&gt;On Thursday evening, &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt; published a memo from Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, a vice president at Facebook who currently leads its hardware efforts. In the memo, Bosworth says that the company’s core function is to connect people, despite consequences that he repeatedly called “ugly.” “That’s why all the work we do in growth is justified. All the questionable contact importing practices,” he wrote. “All the subtle language that helps people stay searchable by friends. All of the work we do to bring more communication in. The work we will likely have to do in China some day. All of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;SKf4p2&quot;&gt;Bosworth distanced himself from the memo, saying in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/boztank/status/979478961582325760&quot;&gt;a Twitter post&lt;/a&gt; that he hadn’t agreed with those words even when he wrote them. He was trying to galvanize a discussion around the company’s growth strategy, he said. CEO Mark Zuckerberg told &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt; that he had not agreed with the sentiments in the post at the time, and that growth should not be a means to an end in itself. “We recognize that connecting people isn’t enough by itself. We also need to work to bring people closer together,” Zuckerberg said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;lGqq73&quot;&gt;After publishing the memo, Bosworth deleted his original post. “While I won’t go quite as far as to call it a straw man, that post was definitely designed to provoke a response,” Bosworth wrote in a memo obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It served effectively as a call for people across the company to get involved in the debate about how we conduct ourselves amid the ever changing mores of the online community. The post was of no particular consequence in and of itself, it was the comments that were impressive. A conversation over the course of years that was alive and well even going into this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;k3Ic05&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I won’t be the one to bring it back for fear it will be misunderstood by a broader population that doesn’t have full context on who we are and how we work.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;uPXksb&quot;&gt;“That conversation is now gone,” Bosworth continued. “And I won’t be the one to bring it back for fear it will be misunderstood by a broader population that doesn’t have full context on who we are and how we work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yjQcdn&quot;&gt;Facebook and Bosworth declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;wcuJzn&quot;&gt;Nearly 3,000 employees had reacted to Bosworth’s memo when &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; viewed it, responding with a mixture of likes, “sad,” and and “angry” reactions. Many employees rallied to Bosworth’s side, praising him for sharing his feelings about sensitive company matters using blunt language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;l47PSS&quot;&gt;Others criticized Bosworth for deleting the post, saying it fueled a narrative about the company that it had something to hide. “Deleting things usually looks bad in retrospect,” one wrote. “Please don’t feed the fire by giving these individuals more fuel (eg, Facebook execs deleting internal communications”). If we are no longer open and transparent, and instead lock-down and delete, then our culture is also destroyed — but by our own hand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;gHuyp1&quot;&gt;Dozens of employees criticized the unknown leakers at the company. “Leakers, please resign instead of sabotaging the company,” one wrote in a comment under Bosworth’s post. Wrote another: “How fucking terrible that some irresponsible jerk decided he or she had some god complex that jeopardizes our inner culture and something that makes Facebook great?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;G0UoCB&quot;&gt;Several employees suggested Facebook attempt to screen employees for a high degree of “integrity” during the hiring process. “Although we all subconsciously look for signal on integrity in interviews, should we consider whether this needs to be formalized in the interview process?” one wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;Pshu1l&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is so disappointing, wonder if there is a way to hire for integrity.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;QpfNrj&quot;&gt;Wrote another: “This is so disappointing, wonder if there is a way to hire for integrity. We are probably focusing on the intelligence part and getting smart people here who lack a moral compass and loyalty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nWbXCA&quot;&gt;Other employees said it would be difficult to detect leakers before they acted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;sGio7F&quot;&gt;“I don’t think we’ve seen a huge internally leaked data breach, but I’ve always thought our ‘open but punitive’ stance was particularly vulnerable to suicide bombers,” one employee wrote “We would be foolish to think that we could adequately screen against them in a hiring process at our scale. … We have our representative share of sick people, drug addicts, wife beaters, and suicide bombers. Some of this cannot be mitigated by training. To me, this makes it just a matter of time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6hnJlL&quot;&gt;That employee followed up to say: “OMG, I just ran back to my ‘puter from a half-eaten lunch with food in my mouth. APOLOGIES to our brothers in sisters in the Austin Office for my insensitive choice of metaphors/words. I’m sorry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;JU5R2P&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have our representative share of sick people, drug addicts, wife beaters, and suicide bombers.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;qMSFka&quot;&gt;Another theory floated by multiple employees is that Facebook has been targeted by spies or state-level actors hoping to embarrass the company. “Keep in mind that leakers could be intentionally placed bad actors, not just employees making a one-off bad decision,” one wrote. “Thinking adversarially, if I wanted info from Facebook, the easiest path would be to get people hired into low-level employee or contract roles.” Another wrote: “Imagine that some percentage of leakers are spies for governments. A call to morals or problems of performance would be irrelevant in this case, because dissolution is the intent of those actors. If that’s our threat — and maybe it is, given the current political situation? — then is it even possible to build a system that defaults to open, but that is able to resist these bad actors (or do we need to redesign the system?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;hWYbo4&quot;&gt;Several employees shared concerns that the leaks had removed some of Facebook’s luster. The company is routinely cited as among the best places to work in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;zsykPj&quot;&gt;“If this leak #$%^ continues, we will become like every other company where people are hesitant to discuss broad-reaching, forward-looking ideas and thoughts, that only the very average ideas and thoughts get discussed and executed,” one employee wrote.” Making them average companies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2OHmOd&quot;&gt;Another employee responded: “Will become? Seems like we are there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;izuvl9&quot;&gt;The leaks also became cause for discussion about the company’s internal sharing tools. Facebook runs on its enterprise product, Facebook for Work. One employee wondered whether the critics of leakers had ignored incentives for sharing created by the product itself. It’s a nuanced thought worth sharing in full:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ZvmGI0&quot;&gt;“It’s interesting to note that this discussion is about leaks pushing us to be more cognizant of our sharing decisions. The result is that we are incentivized toward stricter audience management and awareness of how our past internal posts may look when re-surfaced today. We blame a few ill-intentioned employees for this change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cwlJAm&quot;&gt;“The non-employee Facebook user base is also experiencing a similar shift: the move toward ephemeral and direct sharing results from realizing that social media posts that were shared broadly and are searchable forever can become a huge liability today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;OQoXM5&quot;&gt;A key difference between the outside discussion and the internal discussion is that the outside blames the Facebook product for nudging people to make those broad sharing decisions years ago, whereas internally the focus is entirely on employees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;W0v30D&quot;&gt;Another employee made a similar plea for empathy. “Can we channel our outrage over the mishandling of our information into an empathy for our users’ situation? Can the deletion of a post help us better understand #deletefacebook? How we encourage ourselves to remain open while acknowledging a world that doesn’t always respect the audience and intention fo that information might just be the key to it all. Maybe we should be dogfooding that?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;GNItqO&quot;&gt;For his part, Bosworth promised employees he would continue sharing candid thoughts about Facebook, but said he would likely post less. “When posting comes with the risk that I’ll have to blow up my schedule and defend myself to the national press,” he wrote, “you can imagine it is an inhibitor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;HmGlac&quot;&gt;Here is Bosworth’s full memo to the company today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;27&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;dqigeH&quot;&gt;I’m feeling a little heartbroken tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8TCkxE&quot;&gt;I had multiple reporters reach out today with different stories containing leaks of internal information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;HnSNHJ&quot;&gt;In response to one of the leaks I have chosen to delete a post I made a couple of years ago about our mission to connect people and the ways we grow. While I won’t go quite as far as to call it a straw man, that post was definitely designed to provoke a response. It served effectively as a call for people across the company to get involved in the debate about how we conduct ourselves amid the ever changing mores of the online community. The post was of no particular consequence in and of itself, it was the comments that were impressive. A conversation over the course of years that was alive and well even going into this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0Ud2wt&quot;&gt;That conversation is now gone. And I won’t be the one to bring it back for fear it will be misunderstood by a broader population that doesn’t have full context on who we are and how we work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4wupYL&quot;&gt;This is the very real cost of leaks. We had a sensitive topic that we could engage on openly and explore even bad ideas, even if just to eliminate them. If we have to live in fear that even our bad ideas will be exposed then we won’t explore them or understand them as such, we won’t clearly label them as such, we run a much greater risk of stumbling on them later. Conversations go underground or don’t happen at all. And not only are we worse off for it, so are the people who use our products.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Forgotten Drink That Caffeinated North America for Centuries</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/what-is-yaupon-tea-cassina</guid>
<description>&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sipping on Cassina at the Department of Agriculture.&quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-53756&quot; data-src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/53756/image.jpg&quot;/&gt;Sipping on Cassina at the Department of Agriculture. &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/hec.32428/&quot;&gt;Library of Congress/LC-DIG-hec-32428&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;section-start-text&quot;&gt;Every morning, every day, 85&lt;/span&gt; percent of Americans alter their state of consciousness with a potent psychoactive drug: caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Their most common source is the roasted seeds of several species of African shrubs in the genus &lt;em&gt;Coffea&lt;/em&gt; (coffee), while other Americans use the dried leaves of a species of &lt;em&gt;Camellia&lt;/em&gt; plant from China (tea).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Americans love caffeine, but few realize just how ancient the North American craving for caffeine truly is. North Americans have been enthusiastically quaffing caffeinated beverages since before the Boston Tea Party, before the English founded Jamestown, and before Columbus landed in the Americas. That is to say: North Americans discovered caffeine long before Europeans “discovered” North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Cassina, or black drink, the caffeinated beverage of choice for indigenous North Americans, was brewed from a species of holly native to coastal areas from the Tidewater region of Virginia to the Gulf Coast of Texas. It was a valuable pre-Columbian commodity and widely traded. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/109/35/13944.full&quot;&gt;Recent analyses&lt;/a&gt; of residue left in shell cups from Cahokia, the monumental pre-Columbian city just outside modern-day St. Louis and far outside of cassina’s native range, indicate that it was being drunk there. The Spanish, French, and English all documented American Indians drinking cassina throughout the American South, and some early colonists drank it on a daily basis. They even exported it to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;As tea made from a species of caffeinated holly, cassina may sound unusual. But it has a familiar botanical cousin in yerba maté, a caffeine-bearing holly species from South America whose traditional use, preparation, and flavor is similar. The primary difference between cassina and maté is that while maté weathered the storm of European conquest, cassina has fallen into obscurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png&quot; alt=&quot;At a council, the chief sits at the place of honor surrounded by his advisors.

Cassina is prepared by women in the foreground. &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://fcit.usf.edu/florida/photos/native/lemoyne/lemoyne6/lemoy633.htm&quot;&gt;University of South Florida Libraries Special Collections/ Public Domain&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Today it’s better known as yaupon, and it’s mostly planted as an ornamental throughout the southeastern United States. Recent years have seen a handful of small-scale growers selling and promoting cassina for consumption, typically under the name yaupon tea. Cafes in a few scattered Southern locales are selling it and pushing for a revival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;This is not the first call for a reappraisal. For over a century, botanists, historians, and even the U.S. Department of Agriculture have periodically drawn attention to the absurdity of cassina’s disuse in its native land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;So why was a plant of such well documented potential, which seemingly should have developed into a domestic alternative to expensive tea and coffee imports, ignored for so long? What happened to cassina?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Over the years, cassina has gone by many names. But just one gave the tea a permanent black eye that diminished its commercial prospects for centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;The first Spanish colonists in Florida who, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=AVFbf08bIIEC&amp;amp;pg=PA150&amp;amp;lpg=PA150&amp;amp;dq=sturtevant+%22black+drink+and+other+caffeine%22&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=944nnUw5eD&amp;amp;sig=enmorfNguwo_UoGbfBbMuFnLZq0&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjBwuaUpIraAhWGc98KHRkRD14Q6AEILjAC#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=sturtevant%20%22black%20drink%20and%20other%20caffeine%22&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;one contemporary account&lt;/a&gt;, drank cassina “every day in the morning or evening,” knew it as &lt;em&gt;té del indio&lt;/em&gt; or “cacina”. The English in North Carolina called it &lt;em&gt;yaupon&lt;/em&gt;, a term borrowed from the Catawba language that is still the most common name for the plant itself. In South Carolina, “cassina” was the usual appellation, possibly derived from the long extinct Timucuan language. And colonists throughout the English-speaking colonies often settled simply for “black drink.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Upon export to Europe, cassina was marketed in England under the names “Carolina tea” and “South Sea tea,” and in France as “appalachina,” likely a reference to the Appalachee people.This confusing array of names emphasizes the practicality of the Linnaean classification system, which was still in its infancy when Europeans learned of cassina. William Aiton, an eminent British botanist and horticulturist, director of Kew Gardens, and “Gardener to His Majesty,” is credited with giving cassina the scientific name it bears to this day: &lt;em&gt;Ilex vomitoria&lt;/em&gt;. Ilex is the genus commonly known as holly. Vomitoria roughly translates to “makes you vomit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Timucua of what is now Northeast and North Central Florida and southeast Georgia, at a feast preparing and drinking cassina.&quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-53759&quot; data-src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/53759/image.jpg&quot;/&gt;The Timucua of what is now Northeast and North Central Florida and southeast Georgia, at a feast preparing and drinking cassina. &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-rc11024-timucua-indians-at-a-feast-drawing-possibly-by-le-moyne-de-140407770.html&quot;&gt;Paul Fearn/Alamy&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Cassina does not make you vomit. Both modern scientific analysis and centuries of regular use by Southerners confirms this. But several early European accounts of cassina mention vomiting. Cassina seems to have been used in elaborate purification rituals where men sat in a circle, sung or chanted, and took turns chugging and then throwing up hot cassina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Yet other detailed, first-hand accounts of indigenous people drinking cassina don’t mention vomiting at all. Anthropologist Charles M. Hudson and others have &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=AVFbf08bIIEC&amp;amp;pg=PA4&amp;amp;dq=hudson+black+drink+%22substances+other+than+yaupon%22&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjTvu2OxIDaAhWLjVkKHfpyAjYQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=hudson%20black%20drink%20%22substances%20other%20than%20yaupon%22&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;suggested that a plant with emetic properties&lt;/a&gt; may have been added to the cassina brew (unbeknownst to European observers) or that the black drink ceremony may not have involved cassina at all. Alternatively, if the ritual vomiting did, in fact, involve only cassina, the sheer volume of liquid consumed could explain the vomiting. So could the fact that vomiting was a common ritual practice for Southeastern indigenous people—participants may have trained themselves to throw up at will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Nevertheless, the association of cassina with vomiting persists: Sources such as the Oxford English Dictionary erroneously describe yaupon leaves as having emetic or purgative properties, keeping alive the myth that cassina makes you throw up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption image-outlined lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Ilex vomitoria Aiton&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; of the family &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Aquifoliaceae&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;.&quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-53761&quot; data-src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/53761/image.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ilex vomitoria Aiton&lt;/em&gt; of the family &lt;em&gt;Aquifoliaceae&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://plantgenera.org/species.php?id_species=550419&quot;&gt;Public Domain&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;baseline-grid-hr&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf section-break-graf&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;section-start-text&quot;&gt;William Aiton may have simply&lt;/span&gt; made a long-perpetuated mistake when he named cassina “Ilex vomitoria.” But there’s reason to believe he and other Europeans conspired against the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;As the royal gardener, Aiton knew some of the richest and most powerful people in the British Empire. One of the most profitable and influential forces in that empire was the East India Company, which held a virtual monopoly on the tea trade. Its officers may well have worried that cassina represented a potential replacement for a lucrative British commodity, especially as it grew abundantly within regions then under the control of Spain and France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;In his entry on Ilex vomitoria, Aiton listed “South-Sea Tea” as a common name for cassina, suggesting he was aware of its use as a beverage amongst the English. Further, Aiton chose the name vomitoria even though Carl Linnaeus, the founder of the modern taxonomic system, referenced cassina under the name &lt;em&gt;Ilex Cassine vera Floridanorum&lt;/em&gt; in 1753. (Ilex cassine is now the name for a close relative of cassina, the dahoon holly, which has significantly less caffeine.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;If Aiton’s sensational name choice was simply a mistake, it could have been corrected in the subsequent edition of his book &lt;em&gt;Hortus kewensis&lt;/em&gt;, which was published by his son in 1810. It’s hard to imagine both Aitons missing &lt;em&gt;Bartram’s Travels&lt;/em&gt; (the first English edition was published in the early 1790s) wherein Philadelphia botanist William Bartram describes southeastern American Indians and European traders drinking cassina and makes no mention of them throwing up. There’s no smoking gun, but given that the British Empire passed laws and went to war to maintain monopolies on goods such as sugar, tobacco, and opium, it’s possible Aiton engaged in scientific slander.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Either way, cassina never developed into a major English export or drink of choice. &lt;a href=&quot;https://biology.ufl.edu/2014/09/10/a-misleading-name-reduces-marketability-of-a-healthful-and-stimulating-natural-product/&quot;&gt;Recent research&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Florida suggests that the scientific name continues to make people “leery of buying” cassina despite preferring it over maté in a blind taste test. In the words of Charles M. Hudson, our insistence on associating cassina with vomiting &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=AVFbf08bIIEC&amp;amp;lpg=PA4&amp;amp;dq=hudson%20black%20drink%20%22emphasize%20the%20bizarre%22&amp;amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=hudson%20black%20drink%20%22emphasize%20the%20bizarre%22&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;may be because&lt;/a&gt; “we are all too ready to emphasize the bizarre and exotic in the cultural practices of the Indians.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;That’s not to say that cassina was never drunk widely after the colonization of the Americas. In the earliest days of the Southern colonies—when plantations were being carved out of woodland and luxury imports were rare—cassina drinking was widespread from slaves to plantation owners. But as plantations became larger and more profitable, the nouveau riche demonstrated their wealth by drinking expensive imported tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;“Cassina was so abundant on the coast,” writes Hudson in &lt;em&gt;Black Drink: A Native American Tea&lt;/em&gt;, “that it could be drunk by the poor; hence it became déclassé.” An 1883 encyclopedia entry on cassina summed up this new state of affairs when it &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=g6RHAQAAMAAJ&amp;amp;lpg=PA316&amp;amp;ots=CwEKURygM1&amp;amp;dq=Imperial%20Dictionary%20still%20used%20by%20the%20poorer%20classes&amp;amp;pg=PA316#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22still%20used%20as%20a%20beverage%22&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;stated that&lt;/a&gt; cassina is “still used as a beverage by the poorer classes in North Carolina.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;The Civil War reinforced this association of cassina with a hardscrabble lifestyle. When the South seceded, luxury imports became scarce, and both rich and poor turned to cassina. After the war, when coffee and tea became available again, cassina had acquired more negative associations: war, hunger, and defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;baseline-grid-hr&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf section-break-graf&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;section-start-text&quot;&gt;In the modern South, cassina,&lt;/span&gt; usually known by the name yaupon, is just a plant: a border shrub or small tree in residential developments. (Americans regularly walk by the caffeine-producing plant on their way into coffee shops that source beans from the other side of the globe.) Whether or not the ongoing cassina revival can reverse it ignominy and poor reputation remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;The extent to which coffee and tea are now being marketed as ethical, fair, and environmentally friendly, as well as the surging popularity of cassina’s cousin, yerba maté, would seem to indicate that cassina’s time has come. And yet, as the many calls for cassina’s rediscovery over the past century show, cassina has long been predicted as the next big thing. For it to succeed commercially, a change to its botanical name may be necessary: Like an acquitted suspect, no matter how many times cassina is proven innocent, an air of suspicion and nausea lingers from the original accusation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Novelty, which has replaced necessity as the driving force behind cassina consumption, can only take cassina so far. So what’s hopeful about the recent cassina revival is that it’s centered around cities such as Austin, Texas, and Asheville, North Carolina, which boast strong local food movements. The cities’ growers and cafe owners are touting the unique, richly herbaceous, complex flavor of cassina. It’s also recently become available for purchase by the bag and appeared in bottles in specialty food stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf item-body-last&quot;&gt;Because while explaining cassina calls for a trip into contentious history and unsettling nomenclature, taking a first sip of yaupon is revelatory: America’s rightful caffeinated drink simply tastes wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Wapp – a single-file web framework by the creator of SQLite</title>
<link>https://wapp.tcl.tk</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://wapp.tcl.tk</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;markdown&quot; readability=&quot;23.963788300836&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1.0 Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wapp is a new framework for writing web applications in TCL, with the following advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very small API → easy to learn and use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A complete application is contained in a single file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resistant to attacks and exploits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-platform → CGI, SCGI, or a built-in web server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The MVC design pattern is supported but not required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Wapp framework itself is a single-file TCL script that is &quot;source&quot;-ed, &quot;package require&quot;-ed, or even copy/pasted into the application TCL script&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2-clause BSD license&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2.0 Hello World&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a minimal web application written using Wapp:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;#!/usr/bin/tclsh
package require wapp
proc wapp-default {} {
  wapp-subst {&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Hello, World!&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;\n}
}
wapp-start $argv
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run this application using the built-in web-server, store the code above in a file (here we use the name &quot;hello.tcl&quot;) and do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;tclsh hello.tcl
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run the app using the built-in web-server bound to all TCP addresses and listening on port 8080, use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;tclsh hello.tcl --server 8080
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run the app as an SCGI server listening on port 9001:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;tclsh hello.tcl --scgi 9001
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run the application as CGI, make the hello.tcl file executable and move it into the appropriate directory of the web server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3.0 Further information&lt;/h2&gt;

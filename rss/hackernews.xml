<title>HTTP-over-QUIC will officially become HTTP/3</title>
<link>https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2018/11/11/http-3/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2018/11/11/http-3/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The protocol that's been called HTTP-over-QUIC for quite some time has now changed name and will officially become &lt;strong&gt;HTTP/3&lt;/strong&gt;. This was triggered by this &lt;a href=&quot;https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/quic/RLRs4nB1lwFCZ_7k0iuz0ZBa35s&quot;&gt;original suggestion&lt;/a&gt; by Mark Nottingham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The QUIC Working Group in the IETF works on creating the QUIC transport protocol. QUIC is a TCP replacement done over UDP. Originally, QUIC was started as an effort by Google and then more of a &quot;HTTP/2-encrypted-over-UDP&quot; protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the work took off in the IETF to standardize the protocol, it was split up in two layers: the transport and the HTTP parts. The idea being that this transport protocol can be used to transfer other data too and its not just done explicitly for HTTP or HTTP-like protocols. But the name was still QUIC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People in the community has referred to these different versions of the protocol using informal names such as iQUIC and gQUIC to separate the QUIC protocols from IETF and Google (since they differed quite a lot in the details). The protocol that sends HTTP over &quot;iQUIC&quot; was called &quot;hq&quot; (HTTP-over-QUIC) for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Bishop scared the room at the QUIC working group meeting in IETF 103 when he presented this slide with what could be thought of almost a logo...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot_2018-11-06-HTTP-QUIC-slides-103-httpbis-httpquic-00.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-11770&quot; src=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot_2018-11-06-HTTP-QUIC-slides-103-httpbis-httpquic-00-1200x705.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;474&quot; height=&quot;278&quot; srcset=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot_2018-11-06-HTTP-QUIC-slides-103-httpbis-httpquic-00-1200x705.png 1200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot_2018-11-06-HTTP-QUIC-slides-103-httpbis-httpquic-00-200x117.png 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot_2018-11-06-HTTP-QUIC-slides-103-httpbis-httpquic-00-450x264.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot_2018-11-06-HTTP-QUIC-slides-103-httpbis-httpquic-00-768x451.png 768w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot_2018-11-06-HTTP-QUIC-slides-103-httpbis-httpquic-00.png 1338w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 7, 2018 Dmitri of Litespeed &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dmitri_tikhonov/status/1059998989557395457&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that they and Facebook had successfully done the first interop ever between two HTTP/3 implementations. Mike Bihop's follow-up presentation in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVf_yyMfIPQ&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=4956&quot;&gt;HTTPbis session on the topic can be seen here&lt;/a&gt;. The consensus in the end of that meeting said the new name is HTTP/3!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more confusion. &lt;strong&gt;HTTP/3 is the coming new HTTP version that uses QUIC for transport!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Should you use www or not in your domain? (2017)</title>
<link>https://bjornjohansen.no/www-or-not</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://bjornjohansen.no/www-or-not</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;entry-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 20 years or so, there has been the debate over whether you should use www or not in your web site’s canonical hostname. So should you use www or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;entry-meta&quot;&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Published: &lt;time class=&quot;entry-date published&quot; datetime=&quot;2017-01-20T18:49:52+00:00&quot;&gt;January 20, 2017&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Some historical background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though people often use the terms “domain name” and “host name” interchangeably, there is a difference, and it’s not just about semantics. I will simplify this description a bit, to get a point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an IT administrator, your network would be your domain. It would make sense to give the domain a name, and DNS accommodated for this, so you would register a domain name, e.g. “example.com”. Now, under this domain you would have your hosts. Each network connected machine was considered a host. The machine for serving World Wide Web documents would naturally get the hostname “www” under your domain, and thus given the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) “www.example.com”. You would do the same for all the other hosts in your network, whether you had a web server or not. This is how you kept the hosts in your network organized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To go to the web server in the “example.com” domain, you would then go to the host with the name “www.example.com”. By the way: Back when the dinosaurs roamed the interwebs, there was no such thing as virtual hosts. All web servers served a single web site (at least per IP address). It really didn’t matter what hostname you used, as long as it pointed to the correct IP address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “naked domain name”, i.e. your domain name without “www” – like “example.com” is in DNS terms called “the origin”. As the World Wide Web grew popular in the mid 1990’s some administrators started pointing the origin to the same IP address as the www host. This would let website visitors type only “example.com” in their web browsers, instead of the full hostname “www.example.com”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Then came SEO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the origin, “example.com”, and the hostname, “www.example.com” can point to different IP-addresses – and since January 1997 to different web sites on the same IP-address – people knowledgeable of SEO started telling us that we had to choose a canonical hostname and that the other should point there (with a HTTP 301 response code).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it kind of made sense to choose one. But which one? For SEO it really doesn’t matter at all. As long as you choose one. But there are other concerns than SEO. Read on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Humans’ understanding of an URL&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I worked at a marketing agency just after the turn of the century, there was a real concern that people might not understand that it was a World Wide Web address if we left out the “www” part. I mean, we had just started to leave out “http://”. Also, because of the legacy, I personally preferred to go with the full “correct” hostname, i.e. “www.example.com”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I don’t think this is a matter at all. People will understand that is is a web address whether you have the www or not, if you have a commonly known top level domain. Since one version redirects to the other anyway, it doesn’t matter if your canonical hostname is “www.example.com” and you use just “example.com” in print advertising, since it looks better. Likeweise, if you have one of the thousands of new top level domains, like .beer, you might want to include the www for the same reasons as we had in marketing a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Non-www is prettier and easier&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit: “example.com” is shorter to type, easier to read out (how do you read out “www” on a single breath anyways?) and it simply takes less space. It is fully understandable that people started dropping the “www”-part and just went with the origin as the canonical hostname.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So why is www or not still an issue?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are we still debating this now? Can’t people just use what they prefer, and the rest of us leave them to it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you see, if you’re an administrator of a web site, you probably want to make an educated choice. Because as with most things on the internet, not everything was thought through when we started using them. Things like cookies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cookies are passed down to subdomains&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cookies set from a hostname, will also be sent to all subdomains. I.e. if the website on “example.com” sets a cookie, the browser will also send this cookie when visiting “www.example.com”. Sounds like a good thing, since it’s the same website anyway, right? But the cookie will also be sent to “cdn.example.com”, to “email.example.com”, to “intranet.example.com”, to thirdpartyservice.example.com and so on. And a lot of third party services let you use your domain exactly like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cookie set from “www.example.com” will *not* be sent to any “sibling” hosts like above. Your browser understands that they are not “subservices” but completly different services, and should not get access to your cookies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Unnecessary cookies hurts performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way HTTP and cookies work, is that they are sent from the browser for each and every request to the web server. This means that if your website sets a cookie for the origin (“example.com”) this cookie will also have to be sent to every request that you make to e.g. “email.example.com” or “intranet.example.com”. This slows down the communication and leaves your with a worse user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The cookies can be read by third parties&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if your web site is located at the origin (“example.com”) and have a login to a CMS, the CMS will issue a cookie to your browser to keep you logged in for at least the session. Then, when you visit “someinternalservice.example.com”, the administrator of that service can read that cookie, copy it and use it to login to the corporate CMS for “example.com” as you. The same thing applies to your email service vendor when you visit “email.example.com”, your CDN vendor when you visit “example.com” which loads assets from e.g. “static.example.com” and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re concerned about the security of whatever you have on “example.com”, make sure you slap a “www”- in front of it. If that doesn’t help you choosing whether you should use www or not, I’m not sure what will. Neither HTTPS nor 2FA will help you out, since that cookie is the magic token. Other security measures, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://bjornjohansen.no/restricting-access-to-wordpress-login-by-ip-address&quot;&gt;IP restrictions&lt;/a&gt; will however help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cookies from subdomains, can be shared – if you want to&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if you have a service on a subdomain, like “sso.example.com”, RFC 6265 allows you to set a cookie for the origin and making it shared with “example.com” or “www.example.com”. So avoiding the “bare domain” as a hostname, actually gives you more flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DNS origin can’t be a CNAME&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about flexibility, we have to circle back to talking about DNS again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a limitation in DNS which says that the origin, must be an A type record, which means it has to point to a fixed IP address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your site grows large and you move it to an hosted service, or wants to point it to an Web Application Firewall or a DDoS mitigator, you might want to use a CNAME type record, to point the hostname to another flexible hostname that the vendor manages depending on your traffic and needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if your website is hosted at the origin (“example.com”), you can’t do that. But there is no issue with the “www” hostname being a CNAME record. So if you want any scaling flexibility, now or in the future, you should go with the www hostname from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion: Go with www&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does matter if you use www or not. I agree that the origin domain name looks prettier, but that is just a practical matter in the address bar of the browser itself. You can use “www.example.com” as your canonical host name, but everywhere else, you can just use the bare domain. It will redirect the users to the correct place anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are important matters that says you should use the full hostname with the www: Perfomance-wise, security-wise and in terms of flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should end the “www or not”-debate once and for all: Go with www!&lt;/p&gt;

If so, check out the post “&lt;a href=&quot;https://bjornjohansen.no/move-wordpress-from-non-www-to-www&quot;&gt;Move your WordPress site from non-www to www domain&lt;/a&gt;” and follow the easy steps to moving your WordPress site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people routinely take nutritional supplements such as vitamin D and fish oil in the hopes of staving off major killers like cancer and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the evidence about the possible benefits of the supplements has been mixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, long-awaited government-funded research has produced some of the clearest evidence yet about the usefulness of taking the supplements. And the results — published in two papers — are mostly disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Both trials were negative,&quot; says Dr. Lawrence Fine, chief of the clinical application and prevention branch of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about&quot;&gt;National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute&lt;/a&gt;, a part of the National Institutes of Health, which funded the studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Overall, they showed that neither fish oil nor vitamin D actually lowered the incidence of heart disease or cancer,&quot; Fine says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were presented at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heart.org/&quot;&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; Scientific Sessions in Chicago and released online Saturday by &lt;em&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. One paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1809944&quot;&gt;focused on vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; supplementation, and the other &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1811403&quot;&gt;focused on fish oil.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trials involved nearly 26,000 healthy adults age 50 and older with no history of cancer or heart disease who took part in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vitalstudy.org/&quot;&gt;VITAL&lt;/a&gt; research project. Twenty percent of the participants were African-American.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the participants took either 1 gram of fish oil — which contains omega-3 fatty acids — plus 2,000 international units of vitamin D daily. Others consumed the same dose of vitamin D plus a placebo, while others ingested the same dose of fish oil plus a placebo. The last group took two placebos. After more than five years, researchers were unable to find any overall benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the overall results were disappointing, there appeared to be a beneficial effect when it came to one aspect of heart disease and fish oil: heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A secondary analysis showed taking fish oil lowered the risk of heart attack by about 28 percent, which is a &quot;statistically significant&quot; finding, says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/joann-manson/&quot;&gt;Dr. JoAnn Manson&lt;/a&gt;, who is chief of the division of preventive medicine at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. She led the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who appeared to benefit the most were people who didn't ordinarily eat much fish in their day-to-day diet, as well as African-Americans, Manson says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;African-Americans in the study experienced a 77 percent lower risk of heart attack compared with taking a placebo, which is a &quot;dramatic reduction,&quot; Manson says. Further research is needed to confirm these findings, she adds, but, &quot;in the meantime, it would be reasonable for African-Americans to talk with their health care providers about whether they may be candidates for taking fish oil supplements.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe1814933&quot;&gt;an editorial&lt;/a&gt; also published in the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, authors Dr. John F. Keaney and Dr. Clifford J. Rosen take issue with some of the analysis in the study and write that the positive findings about heart attacks and African-Americans and individuals who don't eat much fish need to be interpreted with caution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no serious side effects, such as bleeding, high blood calcium levels or gastrointestinal symptoms found with either supplement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manson and her colleagues plan to further analyze their data and look for possible links between vitamin D and fish oil and cognitive function, autoimmune disease, respiratory infections and depression. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/08/31/435264223/if-fish-is-brain-food-can-fish-oil-pills-boost-brains-too&quot;&gt;Earlier research&lt;/a&gt; suggests the supplements may have some benefit for these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, NIH official Lawrence Fine says, don't throw out your fish oil and vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;At this point, if one is thinking about supplementation, either omega-3s or vitamin D, talking to your physician or health care provider is the next step,&quot; Fine says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine and Manson stressed that vitamin D and the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil are important nutrients, but that the best way to get them is as part of a well-balanced diet. That includes eating fatty fish like sardines, tuna and salmon, and vitamin D-fortified cereals, milk and orange juice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another study presented at the same meeting examined whether a substance derived from a component of fish oil, known as icosapent ethyl, might reduce adverse events among people who already have cardiovascular risk factors, such as hardening of the arteries, diabetes or high blood fats known as triglycerides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1812792&quot;&gt;that study found&lt;/a&gt; there was a 25 percent risk reduction for patients taking the extract. These patients were less likely to die from heart disease, have a heart attack or stroke, be hospitalized for chest pain or need procedures such as angioplasty, stenting or bypass surgery, researchers reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are reporting a remarkable degree of risk reduction,&quot; says &lt;a href=&quot;https://physiciandirectory.brighamandwomens.org/details/416/deepak-bhatt-cardiovascular_medicine-boston&quot;&gt;Dr. Deepak Bhatt&lt;/a&gt;, who headed the study and is a cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, which was also a randomized clinical trial, tracked participants for an average of five years. The volunteers took icosapent ethyl, which is sold under the brand name Vascepa and was developed by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://investor.amarincorp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/reduce-ittm-cardiovascular-outcomes-study-vascepar-icosapent&quot;&gt;Amarin Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, which funded Bhatt's research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product is available by prescription only for patients with high triglycerides. But the company is expected to apply for FDA approval within the next year to expand treatment to include all high-risk cardiovascular patients.&lt;/p&gt;

Zig uses its own linker (LLD) combined with lazily building compiler-rt to provide out-of-the-box cross-compiling for all supported targets. Zig is intended to replace C. It provides high level features such as generics, compile time function execution, and partial evaluation, yet exposes low level LLVM IR features such as aliases. The Zig project believes that software can and should be perfect. Let the Zig Zen guide your spirit down the most optimal path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bio: Andrew is an open source programmer, interested in electronic music production and video game development. In the Fall 2013 batch he worked on a music player server and a 3D spaceship flight simulator. Andrew is a backend engineer at OkCupid, and working on open source software nights and weekends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About RC: The Recurse Center runs educational programming retreats in New York City. The retreats are free, self-directed, project based, and for anyone who wants to get dramatically better at programming.

<title>Librem5 Hardware Update</title>
<link>https://puri.sm/posts/librem5-2018-11-hardware-report/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://puri.sm/posts/librem5-2018-11-hardware-report/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago we published &lt;a href=&quot;https://puri.sm/posts/librem5-2018-09-hardware-report/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;an update&lt;/a&gt; about the forthcoming of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/&quot;&gt;Librem 5&lt;/a&gt; development kits when we ran into some issues which caused delays. Today we’re bringing you another update on the hardware fabrication process, as well as some pictures and a video. &lt;span id=&quot;more-61256&quot;/&gt;At the same time as the last update got posted, I was on my way to California, where we are fabricating our development kit and base boards (we are bringing everything to life there, and shipping from that same facility).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of fabricating the entire devkit hardware from the ground-up included crossing paths with a couple of storms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Florence&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Hurricane Florence&lt;/a&gt; caused some shipping delays for component parts, and one of our packages also got lost in Memphis—maybe it enjoyed the music and drinks a bit too much? We don’t know because we never heard back from it again. So we had to procure additional parts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/2018-09-07-tropical-storm-typhoon-mangkhut-guam-asia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;typhoon in south east China&lt;/a&gt; caused a week of factory shutdowns, which included our PCB design prototypes!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost right after that was a Chinese holiday, the Golden Week, which is in practice a two week holiday. Luckily we could expedite the PCBs at a fab in Los Angeles and courier ship to us!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all, we had a setback of about three weeks before we were able to make the first prototypes of the boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So once the PCBs finally arrived, on the same day we set up all the machines and worked until 5 a.m. to make the first 10 “golden sample” prototypes of the development base boards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you compare the produced boards with the 3D renders from KiCad (yes, the design of the base board is done in &lt;a href=&quot;http://kicad-pcb.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;KiCad&lt;/a&gt;, and we will be releasing it under a free license once we are finished), you can see the beautiful similarity of the actual outcome. Here we have from left to right: the back side 3D render, the freshly made real board’s back side; the 3D rendered front and real board’s front:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, our team has been furiously and restlessly working on “bringing up” the board, i.e. getting software up and running at least “as far as to be able to test all the peripherals” so that we can verify the base board design before we order the final 300+ boards for series production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-61262 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dev-kit-workbench.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot; srcset=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dev-kit-workbench.jpg 1024w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dev-kit-workbench-300x200.jpg 300w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dev-kit-workbench-768x512.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we base all our work on current mainline Linux kernel 4.18+, this work also involves quite a lot of forward porting of drivers, bug fixing and walking uncharted territory since the i.MX 8M is still very new. So far we have been able to verify the following (which also gives you an impression of the complexity of this task):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Validated Hardware Subsystems&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Charge Controller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USB-C&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serial Downloader (loading u-boot via USB)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eMMC boot (boot mode switch in the “up” position)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SoM (pinout mostly validated, SoC, eMMC, and PMIC working)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UART Debug&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Powering from 18650 battery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charge controller’s thermistor&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Audio Codec&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mini-HDMI&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;WWAN hardware kill switch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GNSS (UART interface &amp;amp; antenna)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USB Hub &amp;amp; SD controller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RedPine WiFi/BT M.2 module on SDIO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RTC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Haptic motor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;push buttons (power button, reset button, volume up, &amp;amp; volume down)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User LED&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power indicator LEDs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;headphones detect (HP_DET)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display’s LED backlight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SPI NOR Flash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earpiece speaker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;External microphone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Headphone speakers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smart card reader &amp;amp; smart card slot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Partially Validated Hardware Subsystems&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;IMU (accelerometer, gyro &amp;amp; magnetometer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proximity / ambient light sensor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WLAN/BT antennae&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On-board microphone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Headset microphone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hardware kill switches for WiFi / BT and microphone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Subsystems Left To Validate&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;MIPI DSI LCD panel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Touch controller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safely charging an 18650 battery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USB-C role switching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microphone select IC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bluetooth (UART4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Camera (MIPI CSI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WWAN I2S interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JTAG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bluetooth I2S interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_Serial_Interface&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;MIPI DSI&lt;/a&gt; display interface is of extremely important, and we can not order the final batch of PCBs before we know that the display (and touch controller) work perfectly. By doing the verification we also indeed discovered some problems, minor things that did not behave as expected and which we are now able to fix. Some other issues are simply mechanical issues that are hard to evaluate just from all the datasheets. And then other things happen, like parts not conforming to standards (like the M.2 WiFi/BT card, of which we got samples just a few days after doing the prototype order). For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;M.2&lt;/a&gt; card has some pretty thick components on the bottom layer and thus can not lay flush on the PCB (which had been an assumption we had when we designed the board), so we need to change the connector for the final boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how the fully equipped current devkit prototypes look like, WiFi/BT card is read in the lower right corner of the back side:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-61271 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/devk-full-back.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot; srcset=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/devk-full-back.jpg 1024w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/devk-full-back-300x200.jpg 300w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/devk-full-back-768x512.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-61272 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/devk-full-front.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot; srcset=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/devk-full-front.jpg 1024w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/devk-full-front-300x200.jpg 300w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/devk-full-front-768x512.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All parts for the final production of the dev kits are procured and still waiting in the magazines on the machines to be placed on the final boards. The kernel team is making amazing progress on &lt;a href=&quot;https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/linux-emcraft&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;mainline Linux 4.18+&lt;/a&gt;, we are in intense communication with other Linux i.MX 8M mainlining partners. The kernel, the GPU drivers and MESA will see quite some i.MX 8M patches from us—and yes, &lt;em&gt;upstream first&lt;/em&gt; was and is our motto, everything we do is and will be pushed upstream!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all this, I am reluctant to give a new timeline for shipping the dev kits… What we know is that our new PCB fabrication here in the USA will be 11 business days. We will make over 300 of these boards, which are pretty complex—we have over 160 different parts and more than 500 components in total per board. This takes some time, even with the amazing SMT machines placing tiny parts (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-mount_technology#Rectangular_passive_components&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;0201 SMD types&lt;/a&gt;). I wouldn’t be able to place these by hand!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From testing the prototypes, it will probably take another week (probably two) until we can give the green light for PCB fabrication to begin, then about two weeks for them to be fabricated, and another week for production, assembly, testing and shipping. As you can see, with all that, we will likely roll into December. With that said however, we are doing our very best to ship out all boards in the early part of December, so that all backers should get their new toys well before the end of the year (given the shipping carriers don’t cause delays).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for all the active community development and tremendous support! See our video below on how these boards are being put together. Oh and by the way, we have a little &lt;strong&gt;survey&lt;/strong&gt; for you, &lt;strong&gt;check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://puri.sm/enterprise/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;enterprise&lt;/a&gt; page&lt;/strong&gt; if you’d like to help!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Sweden&amp;#039;s cashless society is no longer a utopia</title>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;85.900497512438&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Swedish retail payment market is rapidly moving away from using cash. The outstanding value of cash in circulation has dropped to 1% of Swedish GDP. This development raises some crucial issues regarding the state’s role in the payment market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;41&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For hundreds of years, the public has been offered central bank notes and coins. If cash stopped working, it would leave all individuals to rely on the private sector for access to money and payment methods. It would be a historical change without precedence. The central bank of Sweden, the Riksbank, is therefore investigating the potential consequences of this change, including how to design a central bank digital currency, called the e-krona. But what is the e-krona exactly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;40&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's begin at the beginning. Swedish legislation makes it possible for retailers, restaurants and other companies to refuse to accept cash, for instance by putting up a sign at the entrance or by the till. Together with banks that stop offering cash services, refusal of cash is an increasingly widespread phenomenon. Furthermore, Swedes on average are happy to adapt to new technologies, so cards are widespread and the instant payment app Swish has been downloaded by more than half of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By connecting a bank account in any bank with a mobile phone number, Swish has become a popular way to share a restaurant bill, distribute pocket money to children, collect money for a birthday gift at the office and to pay for goods at street markets. Settlement takes place with the help of the Riksbank’s real time gross settlement system. To “swish” money has even become a verb in the Swedish language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;The outstanding value of cash transactions in Sweden is only 1%. &quot; src=&quot;https://assets.weforum.org/editor/ZI6RxNzmjL6R-p3SoJW55b3WH7g0sGkNpkZNiPIYjas.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outstanding value of cash transactions in Sweden is only 1%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image: Unsplash&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a few years, if the current trend in cash usage continues, Swedes could therefore find themselves in a situation where cash is no longer generally accepted as a means of payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;40&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development raises some crucial issues regarding the state’s role in the payment market. For hundreds of years, the public has been offered central bank notes and coins. If cash stops working, it would leave all individuals to rely on the private sector alone to get access to money and payment methods. This would be a historical change without precedence. Norway is seeing a similar trend, and the two central banks are cooperating in this area. In the Eurozone, cash is still used to a high degree. The value of the outstanding amount of cash is equivalent to 10% of the Eurozone GDP, versus the Swedish equivalent of only 1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;26.103225806452&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some time, the Swedish central bank has been analysing this gradual transition of emphasis in our economy – our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.riksbank.se/en-gb/press-and-published/notices-and-press-releases/notices/2018/next-step-a-technical-solution-for-the-e-krona/&quot;&gt;most recent report can be found here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--heading&quot;&gt;Introducing the e-krona&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming years, some hard choices will be required. One option is to do nothing, meaning we accept that the general public no longer has access to central bank money. Such a future would imply a changed scope for the public sector. The payment market would have to be regulated and supervised in new ways to meet fulfil the objective to have a safe, efficient and inclusive payment market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second alternative is to issue central bank money in a digital form, as a complement to cash and the money held in bank accounts. We call the concept “e-krona” – after the Swedish currency, krona. Bank-issued digital currency is a new and relatively unexplored possibility, but it is attracting growing interest from a number of central banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;The value of Swedish cash in circulation over the last 25 years. &quot; src=&quot;https://assets.weforum.org/editor/60_EuKU60DspFKAiilzxYid7fhpDHjda_sz4OHZGIuM.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value of Swedish cash in circulation over the last 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image: Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic concept for e-krona is as follows: it would be digital, and have a 1-to-1 conversion with an ordinary krona held in an account at the Riksbank or stored locally, for example on a card or in a mobile phone app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the individual’s perspective, e-krona could be held either in a value-based form like a card or an app, or in an account-based structure. For the payment industry, the Riksbank would provide an infrastructure for e-krona transactions to which payment service providers can connect and in which they can build payment services for end users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;40&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the scope, and on design choices, there could be different consequences. Its impact on the financial system depends on how large the demand for the e-krona is in different circumstances. Whether it will earn interest or not is another key question. If the e-krona offers zero interest, which makes it equivalent to cash in this regard, it could have negative effects for conducting expansionary monetary policy if interest rates in the economy are low. On the other hand, an e-krona with interest could become a new policy tool for the central bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology to build a functioning e-krona is already available today. It is not dependent on using distributed ledger technology and it is not to be confused with cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to build a prototype that could be issued under the current legal mandate of the Riksbank. The knowledge we acquire along the way will give us room for manoeuvre in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;42&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For hundreds of years, the private sector and the public sector have interacted on how to provide money that works as a store of value and as an efficient medium of exchange. In 2018, the Riksbank is celebrating its 350th anniversary, and looking back at its origins in the 1660s, when bulky and heavy copper coins were exchanged for efficient paper notes. But as technology improves, people’s preferences also change – in our case away from cash. Therefore, we are looking ahead, to see how we can continue to provide society with a safe and efficient payment system for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

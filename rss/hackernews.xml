<title>Carbon Removal Technologies</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;content visible&quot; id=&quot;tab-bio-energy&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BECCS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind BECCS is to capture carbon with trees; burn trees for energy; capture carbon at the smokestack; and bury carbon underground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deployment of BECCS is controversial, among other things, because of the large land area required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot; id=&quot;tab-dac&quot; readability=&quot;45&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Direct Air Capture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind Direct Air Capture is to take CO2 from the air and pump it through a plant that transforms it into valuable resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, one of the companies in the space, Carbon Engineering plans to use CO2 as an input to make synthetic fuels that can substitute for diesel, gasoline, or jet fuel. Other companies plan on creating carbon nanotubes which are useful for batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current issues with DAC are costs ($94/ton of CO2), and a scalable path to large scale CO2 removal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot; id=&quot;tab-biochar&quot; readability=&quot;40&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Biochar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of biochar is to burn organic waste in oxygen-free chambers - and then bury it or use it for agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One researcher contends that burning and burying 10 percent of the world's biomass waste would sequester nearly 5 Gton of CO2 annually. The logistics of actually converting 10 percent or more of the world's organic waste into biochar and burying the result are, at this point at least, incredibly daunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot; id=&quot;tab-srm&quot; readability=&quot;43&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solar Radiation Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SRM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of SRM is to reflect a small amount of inbound sunlight back out into space. Multiple approaches have been proposed: Space-Based Options (satellites in space), Stratosphere-Based Options (injection of sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere), Cloud-Based Options (making them more reflective), and Surface-Based Options (whitening roofs or reflective crops).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SRM is hugely controversial presenting environmental risks, possibility of weaponization, and create regional winners because of unequal deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe somebody will think why is it so and what can we do to avoid it in the future to improve web experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;cee5&quot; id=&quot;cee5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;The new USDC stablecoin is fully collateralized by US dollars and supported by Coinbase and Circle as co-founding members of the CENTRE Consortium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;1484&quot; id=&quot;1484&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Starting today, Coinbase customers in supported jurisdictions can buy, sell, send and receive the USD Coin stablecoin (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coinbase.com/price/usdc?utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_campaign=usdc_announce&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.coinbase.com/price/usdc?utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_campaign=usdc_announce&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;USDC&lt;/a&gt;) at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coinbase.com/?utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_campaign=usdc_announce&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.coinbase.com/?utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_campaign=usdc_announce&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Coinbase.com&lt;/a&gt; and in the Coinbase &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coinbase-bitcoin-wallet/id886427730?mt=8&quot; data-href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coinbase-bitcoin-wallet/id886427730?mt=8&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinbase.android&quot; data-href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinbase.android&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; apps. US customers outside New York state can buy and sell, and customers around the world can send and receive. More geographies will be available in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fc7f&quot; id=&quot;fc7f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This is the first time Coinbase has supported a stablecoin, which is fundamentally different from other cryptocurrencies. Unlike bitcoin or ether, a USDC is meant to represent a single US dollar (USD) that does not move up or down relative to its reference currency. One USDC is a 1:1 representation of a US dollar on the Ethereum blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1780&quot; id=&quot;1780&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Each USDC is 100% collateralized by a corresponding USD held in accounts subject to regular public reporting of reserves. The underlying technology behind the USDC was developed collaboratively between Coinbase and Circle, in our capacity as partners and co-founders of the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://centre.io&quot; data-href=&quot;http://centre.io&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CENTRE Consortium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4e41&quot; id=&quot;4e41&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The advantage of a blockchain-based digital dollar like USDC is easier to program with, to send quickly, to use in dApps, and to store locally than traditional bank account-based dollars. That’s why we think of it as an important step towards a more open financial system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a0f1&quot; id=&quot;a0f1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Use cases for USDC today include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;d3a0&quot; id=&quot;d3a0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Improved send and receive.&lt;/strong&gt; Two Ethereum wallets can quickly send and receive any amount of USDC at any time of day. Large transfers for business purposes become as easy as small e-commerce payments. Consumers can use the Coinbase app to send USDC to someone, while remaining confident the value is stable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;10e3&quot; id=&quot;10e3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Use in dApps and exchanges.&lt;/strong&gt; There is a burgeoning ecosystem of crypto dApps, exchanges, and blockchain-based games. A USDC follows the ERC20 standard, which means it can be used with any app that accepts tokens based on that standard. The USDC can thus be used as a stable digital dollar to buy items in the crypto ecosystem, from Cryptokitties to tickets for blockchain-based games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;096e&quot; id=&quot;096e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;A programmable dollar.&lt;/strong&gt; For developers and fintech companies, a digital dollar like USDC is easier to program with. For example, given the private keys for USDC, a program can easily send and receive them back and forth using the public Ethereum blockchain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;06f1&quot; id=&quot;06f1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Today’s launch is made possible by the collaboration between Coinbase and Circle, as co-founders of the new CENTRE Consortium. Both Coinbase and Circle operate with a compliance-first approach and a track record of security. That’s why we believe CENTRE is uniquely positioned to offer USDC to people who want to take advantage of the benefits of stablecoins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0463&quot; id=&quot;0463&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;USDC will be coming to Coinbase Pro in the coming weeks, and is already supported on Coinbase Wallet, a user-controlled wallet where people can store ERC20 tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/10/pixel-3-xl-review-great-software-but-google-just-isnt-a-hardware-leader/4/&quot;&gt;Google's Pixel 3 smartphone&lt;/a&gt; is shipping out to the masses, and people hoping to take advantage of the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/09/how-qi-wireless-charging-works-and-why-it-hasnt-taken-over-yet/&quot;&gt;Qi wireless charging&lt;/a&gt; capabilities have run into a big surprise. For some unexplained reason, Google is locking out third-party Qi chargers from reaching the highest charging speeds on the Pixel 3. Third-party chargers are capped to a pokey 5W charging speed. If you want 10 watts of wireless charging, Google hopes you will invest in its outrageously priced Pixel Stand, which is $79.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/22/google-limits-pixel-3-wireless-charging-rate-standard-5w-third-party-charging-pads/&quot;&gt;Android Police&lt;/a&gt; reports that a reader purchased an Anker wireless charger for their Pixel 3, and, after noticing the slow charging speed, this person contacted the company. Anker confirmed that something screwy was going on with Google's charging support, saying &quot;Pixel sets a limitation for third-party charging accessories and we are afraid that even our fast wireless charger can only provide 5W for these 2x devices.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Normally we would chalk this up to some kind of bug, but apparently Google told Android Police that this was &lt;em&gt;on purpose&lt;/em&gt;. The site doesn't have a direct quote, but it writes that, after reaching out to Google PR, it was &quot;told that the Pixel 3 would charge at 10W on the Pixel Stand [and that] due to a 'secure handshake' being established that third-party chargers would indeed be limited to 5W.&quot; We've asked Google &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it is doing this and will update this article if we hear back, but it's hard to imagine a justification for this.
&lt;p&gt;Regular 10W wireless chargers can be had for around $15-$25, so Google's $79 Pixel Stand comes at a hefty markup. Qi is a standard, and a phone should strive to work with every charger. Some Samsung phones already support 15W wireless charging under the Qi standard, so there doesn't seem to be any reason for Google's 5W limit. The $79 Pixel Stand uses the &quot;secure handshake&quot; to provide a bit of security for the phone's ambient display mode, which can do things like display a photo slideshow while charging. That's not an excuse for limiting the charging speed, though. Another oddity is that the Pixel 3 displays &quot;Charging rapidly&quot; while on a 5W or 10W wireless charger, which is not correct, especially when the wired charger is 18W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very disappointing given that the Pixel 3 made a big sacrifice to make wireless charging work: it switched from metal to a fragile glass back. To now limit faster wireless charging to its own charger is probably going to ruffle some feathers. It's another strange hardware decision on a phone full of strange hardware decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Motorola and iFixit partner to sell phone repair kits</title>
<link>https://ifixit.org/blog/11644/motorola-ifixit-partnership/</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Motorola was founded in the tiny Chicago suburb of Schaumburg, Illinois in 1928. With just $565 to their name, brothers Paul and Joseph Galvin purchased business plans from a bankrupt tech company, rented out a tiny corner of an office building, and hired just five employees to embark on what would soon become&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.motorola.com/us/home&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Motorola, Inc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The company’s first products were&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_eliminator&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;battery eliminators&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, devices that hooked up battery-powered radios to household electricity. But radio technology soon advanced, and, like all technology does at some point, battery eliminators became obsolete. However, Paul Galvin already had his eye on the next target: car radios. He enlisted his engineers to invent a radio receiver that could be embedded in most vehicles for a reasonable price. They were successful, and Galvin was able to sell enough orders to keep Motorola in business.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_DynaTAC&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It wasn’t until sixty years later, in 1983, that Motorola manufactured the world’s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_DynaTAC&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;first commercial cell phone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. In 2005, they transformed the mobile phone game with the brightly colored&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmGP86bmAnE&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Razr flip phone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. In 2011, the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Motorola+Droid+Bionic+Teardown/6449&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Motorola Droid Bionic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;became the most repairable smartphone we’d ever disassembled, scoring a 9 out of 10 on our&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/smartphone-repairability&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;repairability scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. And today, Motorola continues their dedication to putting consumers first—they’re the first smartphone manufacturer ever to supply OEM parts to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/Motorola&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;iFixit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like Motorola, iFixit started out small. Our founders, college roommates&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/User/2/Kyle+Wiens&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kyle Wiens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/User/4/Luke+Soules&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Luke Soules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, opened iFixit out of their dorm room in 2003 when they couldn’t find a repair manual for Kyle’s broken laptop. And even as we’ve expanded to supply&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/store&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;replacement parts and tools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;to consumers and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://pro.ifixit.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;repair businesses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;around the world, we’ve made the conscious choice to stay small.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some folks mistake our size and mission for meaning that we don’t want to work with larger manufacturers. That’s not true. In fact, most manufacturers don’t want to work with us. But not Motorola—they’re the first major smartphone manufacturer in support of what we stand for. And they’re a pioneer of the mobile phone and serve tens of millions of customers around the world, to boot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For fixers like us, this partnership is representative of a broader movement in support of our Right to Repair. It’s proof that OEM manufacturers and independent repair can co-exist. Big business and social responsibility, and innovation and sustainability, don’t need to be mutually exclusive. Motorola is setting an industry-leading example of a company that’s looking forward—not just six months ahead to next quarter’s margins, but decades ahead when devices are damned for the landfill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the landfill is where many devices end up in a manufacturer-dominated repair market: E-waste is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.unu.edu/media/unu.edu/news/52624/UNU-1stGlobal-E-Waste-Monitor-2014-small.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;50 million ton&lt;/a&gt; global problem. The batteries smartphone-makers are stubbornly gluing into their phones contributed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/09/11/explosive-problem-with-recycling-ipads-iphones-other-gadgets-they-literally-catch-fire/?noredirect=on&amp;amp;utm_term=.5dac125446cf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;40 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the past two years’ e-waste recycling fires in California. We simply &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-climate-report-2040.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;don’t have time&lt;/a&gt; to carry on with this throwaway culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like the Galvin brothers’ battery-eliminators, no tech lives forever. But we&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;can&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;make sure it lives longer. And that’s exactly what Motorola is doing. By giving consumers easier access to parts, people are better equipped to fix their broken devices—and more fixing means less e-waste.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;7.2903225806452&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/ALAX5PyCWnHePaJV.huge&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;623&quot; height=&quot;467&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;It’s official—Motorola is the first major smartphone manufacturer to supply OEM parts to iFixit. Pictured: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Motorola+Moto+Z+Play+Screen+Replacement/98353&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Moto Z Play&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We can’t fix the system alone. We need our community of fixers to spread the word online and in their local communities. We need legislators to make fair repair laws that hold manufacturers responsible. And most of all, we need manufacturers to make integral changes to their business models to put people and the planet before profit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Motorola is setting an example for major manufacturers to embrace a more open attitude towards repair. If you’re a Motorola customer, you can now either send in your broken device directly to &lt;a href=&quot;https://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/app/mcp/service/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Motorola&lt;/a&gt; for repair—or you can fix it yourself with the highest quality parts and tools, plus a free step-by-step guide, all included in our official &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/Search?query=motorola%20fix%20kits&amp;amp;doctype=products&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Motorola OEM Fix Kits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/IjykgCZ361iE3IjE&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;529&quot; height=&quot;529&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;The selection of tools included in each Motorola OEM Fix Kit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s a model worth replicating, and we couldn’t be more thrilled to consider Motorola a repair ally.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Mars likely to have enough oxygen to support life: study</title>
<link>https://phys.org/news/2018-10-mars-oxygen-life.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://phys.org/news/2018-10-mars-oxygen-life.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;first-block&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-block-ins&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;lightbox&quot; href=&quot;https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/2018/thenewresear.jpg&quot; title=&quot;The new research was made possible by the discovery by NASA's Curiosity Mars rover of manganese oxides&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/csz/news/800/2018/thenewresear.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The new research was made possible by the discovery by NASA's Curiosity Mars rover of manganese oxides&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The new research was made possible by the discovery by NASA's Curiosity Mars rover of manganese oxides
&lt;p&gt;Modern-day Mars may be more hospitable to oxygen-breathing life than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;article-banner first-banner&quot;&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests that salty water at or near the surface of the red planet could contain enough dissolved O2 to support oxygen-breathing microbes, and even more complex organisms such as sponges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nobody thought of Mars as a place where aerobic respiration would work because there is so little oxygen in the atmosphere,&quot; said Vlada Stamenkovic an Earth and planetary scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory who led the work. &quot;What we're saying is it is possible that this planet that is so different from Earth could have given aerobic life a chance.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the report, Stamenkovic and his coauthors also identified which regions of Mars are most likely to contain brines with the greatest amounts of dissolved oxygen. This could help NASA and other space agencies plan where to send landers on future missions, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work was published Monday in &lt;em&gt;Nature Geoscience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On its surface, the planet Mars is not what you would consider a hospitable place for most Earthlings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here on Earth, 21 percent of our atmosphere is made up of oxygen—thanks to the abundance of plants and other organisms that create oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Martian atmosphere, on the other hand, is made up of just .145 percent oxygen, according to data collected by the Mars rovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With no plants to make O2, the minuscule amount of oxygen on Mars is created when radiation from the sun interacts with CO2 in the planet's atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Mars' atmosphere is extremely thin—160 times thinner than Earth's atmosphere. In addition, the temperature at the surface frequently drops to minus 100, making it extremely difficult for liquid water to exist on the planet's surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pure liquid water would either freeze or evaporate away on Mars, but salty water, or brines, could remain in a liquid state at or just below the surface of the planet, the authors said. That's because water mixed with salts has a lower freezing temperature than plain water. (That's why those unfortunate people who live in cold climates use salt to melt the ice on their sidewalks.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first part of the paper, the authors use computer models to show that water mixed with salts already present on Mars could be stable in a liquid state at or near the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the authors were convinced that these liquid brines could exist, their next step was to determine how much dissolved oxygen they could absorb from the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If there are brines on Mars, then the oxygen would have no choice but to infiltrate them,&quot; said Woody Fischer, a geobiologist at Caltech who worked on the study. &quot;The oxygen would make it everywhere.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To calculate how much oxygen the brines might absorb, the researchers had to consider their chemistry, as well as the temperature and air pressure at the Martian surface. Brines will absorb more oxygen when the temperature is lower and the air pressure is higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their results showed that modern Mars could support liquid environments with enough dissolved O2 to support oxygen-breathing microbes across the planet. They also found that the oxygen concentrations would be especially high in brines found at the polar regions, where temperatures are cooler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, this work has been done through computer modeling. But experts still said that the study looks robust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The best studies that rely on models for their results conduct a thorough review of the possible variables that can influence the model output,&quot; said Kathleen Mandt, a planetary biologist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. &quot;This study does a good job at exploring a range of possible outcomes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the study doesn't do, however, is prove that there are indeed brines on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What we know is that theoretically there should be brines on Mars, and that they would be able to dissolve enough oxygen to be biologically useful,&quot; Stamenkovic said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step, he said, is two-fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He hopes that researchers here on Earth will do experiments to put oxygen-breathing microbes in the brines that could occur on Mars to find out what type of chemistry they do and whether they can thrive. The other step would be to send a lander to Mars that can look for brines from the shallow to the deep subsurface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Amazing work has been done by NASA to look for evidence of past habitable environments,&quot; he said. &quot;I am a big promoter of looking for current habitable environments, and we can do that by starting to explore if there is liquid water on Mars.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, Stamenkovic is working to develop a new tool, no bigger than a shoe box, that could be used to find water on Mars and determine its salinity, no digging necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He calls it TH2OR.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>World&amp;#039;s oldest intact shipwreck discovered in Black Sea</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/23/oldest-intact-shipwreck-thought-to-be-ancient-greek-discovered-at-bottom-of-black-sea</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/23/oldest-intact-shipwreck-thought-to-be-ancient-greek-discovered-at-bottom-of-black-sea</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists have found what they believe to be the world’s oldest intact shipwreck at the bottom of the Black Sea where it appears to have lain undisturbed for more than 2,400 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 23-metre (75ft) vessel, thought to be ancient Greek, was discovered with its mast, rudders and rowing benches all present and correct just over a mile below the surface. A lack of oxygen at that depth preserved it, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A ship surviving intact from the classical world, lying in over 2km of water, is something I would never have believed possible,” said Professor Jon Adams, the principal investigator with the Black Sea Maritime &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/archaeology&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Archaeology&lt;/a&gt; Project (MAP), the team that made the find. “This will change our understanding of shipbuilding and seafaring in the ancient world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ship is believed to have been a trading vessel of a type that researchers say has only previously been seen “on the side of ancient Greek pottery such as the ‘Siren Vase’ in the British Museum”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;The ‘Siren Vase’ in the British Museum: the shipwreck is believed to be a vessel similar to that shown bearing Odysseus.&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23314dfe6cd0f62c08338e5128b1ac3a155fd8e0/0_0_3543_2650/master/3543.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=01a3e0af3757a198ea98f2e038bcdb56&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That work, which dates from about the same period, depicts a similar vessel bearing Odysseus past the sirens, with the Homeric hero lashed to the mast to resist their songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team reportedly said they intended to leave the vessel where it was found, but added that a small piece had been carbon dated by the University of Southampton and claimed the results “confirmed [it] as the oldest intact shipwreck known to mankind”. The team said the data would be published at the Black Sea MAP conference at the Wellcome Collection in London later this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/oct/2018-10-23T01:01:04.html&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;locator&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was among more than 60 shipwrecks found by the international team of maritime archaeologists, scientists and marine surveyors, which has been on a three-year mission to explore the depths of the Black Sea to gain a greater understanding of the impact of prehistoric sea-level changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They said the finds varied in age from a “17th-century Cossack raiding fleet, through Roman trading vessels, complete with amphorae, to a complete ship from the classical period”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentary team made a two-hour film that is due to be shown at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.britishmuseum.org/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;British Museum&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>iPhones are hard to use</title>
<link>https://blog.fawny.org/2018/10/22/hardtouse/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.fawny.org/2018/10/22/hardtouse/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I once wrote a user manual for a handheld engine-diagnostics module for Daewoo cars. I know “hard to use” when I see it. iPhones are hard to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;15.950538687561&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On two occasions on the same bus route, I couldn’t stand to watch late-middle-aged persons (eyeglasses perched on forehead in one case) struggle to read their iPhones. I took hold of their phones for a moment each (I got permission) and brought up the well-hidden screen for text-size selection. They picked the bigger fonts they’d needed all along. They were so grateful it was embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same thing later happened, though not on a bus, with an 85-year-old who was also struggling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another senior knows he can send a text message to a certain phone number containing the ID number of a bus stop, but had no idea that was the worst possible way to get a transit prediction, nor that transit predictions could work everywhere, nor what to do if he were in an unfamiliar place and/or could not find the number of a bus stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(How did this senior learn to use his iPhone? He asked his wife how to do things. He also thought he had to use the Gmail app to read his Gmail.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2.2688172043011&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My almost-blind friend upgraded from an iTouch to an iPhone 8, then couldn’t check his voicemail for weeks because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/joeclark/sets/72157696848140930&quot; title=&quot;Flickr set&quot;&gt;iPhone keyboards and keypads randomly change or invert their colours&lt;/a&gt; and he simply could not see or locate the number buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;TiOS_diallingvoicemail_850h.png-img&quot; class=&quot;splorpist&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://fawny.org/blogimages2017/iOS_diallingvoicemail_850h.png&quot; alt=&quot;Light keypad, then dark keypad with Voicemail title&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before and after calling voicemail&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was obviously an itinerant Filipina nanny or maid on the way to a temp gig stopped me to ask where a well-hidden street with a hard-to-pronounce name was. “Huh?” I said. She opened her iPhone X (which had then just been released) and showed me its map. She had no idea she could ask the phone for directions. (And only after I saw the map did I understand the name she mispronounced.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;UPDATE&lt;/span&gt;) A full day after publishing this posting, I remembered that even at the time even I forgot one could ask the iPhone for directions. People just blank on things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to tell someone who uses his Apple Watch for notifications and daily fitness tracking that his watch could give him directions &lt;em&gt;and that his phone had a Health app&lt;/em&gt;. I had to explain to him how to search for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;w33&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very advanced, very tuned-in people learn about, and learn how to use, new Apple features by watching them being demonstrated onstage during Apple keynote events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s everybody else. &lt;span id=&quot;more-7565&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don Norman told us several times several years ago (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-apples-products-so-confusing-ignore-design-don-norman/&quot; title=&quot;Why are Apple’s products so confusing? They ignore design principles&quot;&gt;Ⅰ&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/apples_products_are.html&quot; title=&quot; Apple’s products are getting harder to use because they ignore principles of design&quot;&gt;Ⅱ&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/3053406/how-apple-is-giving-design-a-bad-name&quot; title=&quot;How Apple is giving design a bad name&quot;&gt;Ⅲ&lt;/a&gt;) that iPhones hide their functions. Apple never admits it makes mistakes. The next time you hear Tim Cook or somebody recounting a tale of a guy who crashed his car and was able to call a paramedic using his Apple Watch, think instead of millions of people who cannot use their phones for basic &lt;em&gt;or truly serious&lt;/em&gt; needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an alleged one billion “iOS devices” in use over a decade, Apple’s mistakes are the butterfly effect writ large. Anything that people could get wrong, or simply not know about, will be gotten wrong or will go unknown by tens of millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;street_201810hardtouse&quot;&gt;It’s a 1½-way street&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the iPhone context there are things you should reasonably expect are possible without any reflection (my iPhone has a calculator). There are things that should have been obvious in retrospect (my iPhone can give me directions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet sometimes people just need to learn the basics. There are people who Google “Facebook” to go to Facebook. (They don’t know what a browser address bar is despite its having stared them in the face for a decade, and also don’t know about bookmarks.) There are people who know what address bars are but not search bars, so they go to &lt;code&gt;google.com&lt;/code&gt; for every search. (&lt;abbr title=&quot;Compare&quot;&gt;Cf.&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fawny.org/browserfind/&quot; title=&quot;In the archives: The browser Find command&quot;&gt;the browser Find command&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shouldn’t be afraid of your phone. You shouldn’t feel inhibited from just trying things out. But we are. Me, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;necess_201810hardtouse&quot;&gt;Two absolute necessities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they’re both hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;textsize_201810hardtouse&quot;&gt;Text size&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://fawny.org/blogimages2017/textsize_650h.png&quot; alt=&quot;Larger text screen with third-to-last option selected&quot; class=&quot;alignright outdent10&quot; /&gt; If Apple actually cared about accessibility (it does not), on the setup screen for every iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch would be a step you could not skip wherein you have to choose your preferred text size. And it would state explicitly that if you have to pick a size that seems a bit too big or one that’s a bit too small, go bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function relates to blindness less than you might expect. Blind people don’t all need things blown up huge. My blind friend mentioned above needs normal-sized type. This issue relates to hundreds of millions of middle-aged people with presbyopia, the aging-related inability to focus that got its name three centuries ago. (It’s &lt;em&gt;inability&lt;/em&gt; to focus. &lt;em&gt;Nothing&lt;/em&gt; you can do will bring the object into focus without moving it or adding a lens.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If – further – Apple were committed to diversity (it is not), middle-aged persons would be involved in product and software development and would be present to kick up a fuss when they themselves cannot read the products they created. (Or their complaints would actually be heeded.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;wifi_201810hardtouse&quot;&gt;Constant intrusive reminders of wifi networks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even just yesterday I saw the hundredth or thousandth person instantly and reflexively and uncomprehendingly dismiss the alert box that jumps up whenever you &lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt; near a wifi signal you’ve logged into while there are &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; networks to choose from. (I stood next to a friend once and took the phone out of his hand to &lt;a href=&quot;http://osxdaily.com/2012/04/07/stop-iphone-looking-for-wifi-networks/&quot; title=&quot;How-to article&quot;&gt;turn this function off&lt;/a&gt;. I did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; get permission but I did it anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anything in the Apple “ecosystem” reeks of the kind of Windows autism that repels Macintosh supremacists, it is every iPhone’s insistence on interrupting you just because you passed by a wifi router.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try this experiment. Take any kind of ride through an urban setting passing coffeeshops or dense residences like high-rises and condos. (Or just businesses. &lt;em&gt;Everybody&lt;/em&gt; has wireless Internet.) Hold your phone and pretend to do something with it. You’ll be interrupted endlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say again: Everyone dismisses this dialogue instantly, with no knowledge of what they’re doing &lt;em&gt;or what &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; was doing&lt;/em&gt;, and with no memory of having done it. It’s a special kind of annoyance akin to dissociative anæsthesia, in that you may not know what just happened but you sure as shit don’t want to relive it. Yet you will: It’s on by default. (And it’s too maddening for a screenshot here.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;security&quot;&gt;Security (of the person)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;36.458333333333&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;pass_201810hardtouse&quot; readability=&quot;10.639024390244&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Apple calls its passwords pass&lt;em&gt;codes&lt;/em&gt;, nobody has any clue at all that you can use an alphanumeric pass&lt;em&gt;word&lt;/em&gt; instead of a string of six digits. (Like &lt;kbd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2018/10/11/kanye-change-your-iphone-passcode-now-using-000000-bad-idea/1606983002/&quot; title=&quot;‘USA Today’ coverage&quot;&gt;000000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/kbd&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terminology is painful across the board. “Numeric passcode” and “password” and “alphanumeric passphrase” and “alphanumeric” are all terms we shouldn’t have to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interface biases you almost irrevocably toward a numeric pass&lt;em&gt;code&lt;/em&gt; instead of a pass&lt;em&gt;word&lt;/em&gt;. My blind friend had no idea what was going on one day when my login screen came up showing a keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that pass&lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt; are so unusual &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/09/apple-fixes-a-pair-of-lockscreen-bugs-with-ios-7-0-2-update/&quot; title=&quot;iOS 7.0.2&quot;&gt;there was a time when you couldn’t log into your phone if you were Greek and used one&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, it stands to reason that pass&lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt; don’t have to use the characters on an American computer keyboard. Even Apple did not know that for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;MedicalID_201810hardtouse&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seniors love iPads, but seniors and unhealthy people in general have a serious pressing need to fill out the Medical ID section (not obvious) in the Health app (also not obvious). Exactly the people who need this function are the least likely to use it. We cannot, and should not, rely on these seniors’ grandkids or caregivers to do it for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fill out these fields and not only could a paramedic, or just a bystander, learn what medical conditions you have if you’re unconscious, &lt;em&gt;they can phone your emergency contacts&lt;/em&gt; (and also call an ambulance via 911 or local equivalent). Somebody &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; steal your phone while you’re lying half-dead on a sidewalk, but &lt;em&gt;somebody else&lt;/em&gt; could give you a serious headstart on getting your emergency taken care of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;directions_201810hardtouse&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few know that Siri and Maps can give you spoken and written directions. Even explaining it that way is too dry and abstract. I’ve had to say the following to people who visibly do not understand when I tell them their phone can give them directions: “If you ever get lost, hold the button down and say ‘Get me home.’ You can also hold the button down and say ‘Where am I?’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; have had to use both of those features. Within broad limits, there is no need to get lost ever again if you have an iPhone. Now specify for me how many people know that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;contactcard_201810hardtouse&quot; readability=&quot;4.9603174603175&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You really need to tell the phone, &lt;a href=&quot;http://osxdaily.com/2018/03/08/set-my-information-siri-ios/&quot; title=&quot;How to Set Your Personal Info with Siri on iPhone and iPad&quot;&gt;and/or Siri&lt;/a&gt;, who you are and who your family members are. This involves creating a contact card (what’s that?) &lt;em&gt;for yourself&lt;/em&gt; and linking to it. Then all your family members need their own cards, and you have to laboriously specify their relationships to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I insist this is not an optional or nice-to-have feature. If you have chest pain, you have to be able to hold the button down and say “Call Charlie” or “Call my wife.” (God help us if Siri asks which Charlie to call.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another friend really did have chest pain in a foreign country and it never occurred to him to call anybody. So in fact, Apple, a trillion-dollar corporation, has to put considerably greater resources into telling people how to set up their phones for emergencies so they will actually use those phones then. Again, this means &lt;em&gt;forcing people to do it upon setup&lt;/em&gt; and making it exceedingly clear, in writing and in video, what their phones can do for them when they need their phones the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a simple example any non-autist could have figured out over the last half-decade of iPhone development, say the following to Siri: “I’m in trouble.” Or try “I need help.” Shouldn’t those do something useful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, if you set up a contact card and identify yourself as the owner, anyone can ask Siri “Whose phone is this?” if they find your lost phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;VIP_201810hardtouse&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, almost nobody knows you can designate some correspondents as “VIP,” so that their messages and E‑mails really get in your face. It’s also so hard to do that I have to Google it every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seriously advanced security features like two-factor authentication (which kind? Apple offers two) are exactly the sort of thing only experts who don’t need them will ever set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;basic_201810hardtouse&quot;&gt;“Basic” features few understand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observing what are dismissively called “normal people” (or “users”) for more than a decade, the one thing iPhone owners are proud they know how to do is force-quit apps. They also know how to set a ringtone and choose atrocious wallpaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt;. But they aren’t to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;10.942949407966&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;swipe_201810hardtouse&quot; readability=&quot;3.6483516483516&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People kind of don’t know that they can swipe up or down from top or bottom of screen. As an example, I certainly almost never see anybody turn wifi on or off that way (it’s almost always through Settings). They certainly don’t know what Control Center and Notification Center are by name. (They also &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/08/22/iphone-6-plus-camera&quot; title=&quot;e.g., Gruber&quot;&gt;don’t know what their iSight camera is&lt;/a&gt;. They don’t know what Springboard is, and shouldn’t have to. But do they know what the home screen is?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;swipeLR_201810hardtouse&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swiping from left and right edges is barely known as being equivalent to Back and Forward commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;manip_201810hardtouse&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can directly manipulate almost anything on the lock screen. (They don’t know it’s a “lock screen.” They don’t know what they’ve done to their phone is “lock” it. They know they haven’t turned it off, exactly, except for the minority who completely power down their phones every single time they stop using them. Again, my blind friend was one of those people at the outset – because he believed what a Windows/Android user had told him about “battery life.”) They don’t know that those aren’t pictures on their screen but objects that can be manipulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exception: Music or podcasts, because the play/pause icons are self-explanatory. But try getting someone to clear a meeting reminder, or respond to a message, right from the lock screen. Only experts know that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;pressandhold_201810hardtouse&quot; readability=&quot;1.86741102582&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press-and-hold is completely undiscoverable &lt;em&gt;except by accident&lt;/em&gt;. (But &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT207213&quot; title=&quot;Apple Support page for creating mailboxes&quot;&gt;is that “3D Touch” or is it “press and hold” or might it be “press deeply”&lt;/a&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can press-and-hold do that people don’t know about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;12.407483552632&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directly move a scrollbar. (Fails most of the time due to tiny narrow hotspots you’re expected to hit on the first go.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show a magnified absolute-centred duplicate of nearly anything onscreen you cannot actually manipulate, like whatever is in the title bar. (Try pressing and holding on the battery icon.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reader Mode in Safari, hugely useful in and of itself and nearly unknown. (Tap to activate; hold to customize.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy and paste. I insist that few know this function exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;keyboard_2018.10.23update&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;UPDATE&lt;/span&gt;) I forgot to mention that you can hold down on the keyboard to turn that keyboard into a trackpad manqué. So hard to use (and, of course, completely undiscoverable) that, while demonstrating it to my blind friend, I had to Google a raft of articles to figure out how it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;move_201810hardtouse&quot; readability=&quot;3.8758620689655&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Move apps around. Creating a folder by dropping one app onto another is the second-worst interface feature of iOS. (Nº 1 with a bullet is undo; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fawny.org/2018/10/22/hardtouse/#undo_201810hardtouse&quot; title=&quot;Gold standard of hidden features&quot;&gt;see below&lt;/a&gt;.) Pressing and holding on apps is what people do by accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, pressing and holding happens &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; by accident for non-experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know drag-and-drop exists on iPhones? I do. I can’t get it to work half the time. It requires a lighter press than 3D Touch but more than a tap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HONOURABLE MENTION&lt;/span&gt;: If somebody told you your Home button was going to wear out, hence you turned on AssistiveTouch, you were lied to. (That lie will have been expressed in Chinese. I have never seen a disabled person with AssistiveTouch turned on. &lt;em&gt;Only&lt;/em&gt; people with broken screens and ethnic Chinese use it, in my direct observation and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/Why-do-so-many-people-in-Beijing-use-assistive-touch-on-their-iPhones&quot; title=&quot;Quora article&quot;&gt;according to popular lore&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;diabolical_201810hardtouse&quot;&gt;Diabolical interfaces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;7.6544600938967&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;callwaiting&quot; readability=&quot;2.5475409836066&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/joeclark/31667103476/&quot; title=&quot;Flickr photo&quot;&gt;user interface for call waiting&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/joeclark/14106135654/&quot; title=&quot;Second Flickr photo&quot;&gt;another example&lt;/a&gt;) not only is confusing on its face, it’s impossible to use &lt;em&gt;while you’re talking on the phone&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;after you realize there’s another call coming in&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;while you’re trying not to miss that call&lt;/em&gt; (or are annoyed because your phone interrupted you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;search_2018.10.22&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can search your iPhone. Whole categories of items cannot be found (e.g., photos with real filenames), but you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; search. You just have to know the following sequence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find a spot in Springboard (what’s that?) with no apps or folders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pull down. (Not from the top of the screen.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type your search term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out you can swipe left (in most languages) from the home screen and Search appears there, too – but, due to banner blindness, it’s functionally invisible with the avalanche of coloured and vibrant items below it. I know it’s there and I basically never see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;photo_URL_201810hardtouse&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two hardest things to get onto or off of an iPhone: A photo or an URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;onesong_201810hardtouse&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest task that is functionally impossible to do (also on Macintosh): Play exactly one song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;experts_201810hardtouse&quot;&gt;If experts who get paid to cover Apple do not know a feature exists, it does not&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most advanced Apple experts – &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/2018/10/icloud_photo_library_start_over&quot; title=&quot;Gruber&quot;&gt;one, actually&lt;/a&gt; – had no idea the following was possible. And, as with so many features, the right way to demonstrate them is via video, not a written explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; select lots and lots of photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;2.8837209302326&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;6.6744186046512&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albums in the Photos app are opaque and basically go unused; that’s why Camera Roll &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2014/10/16/camera-roll-ios-81/&quot; title=&quot;In iOS 8.1&quot;&gt;had to be reinstated&lt;/a&gt; after it was removed for our own good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, go into any album. (Except shared ones, and except a few other kinds.) Hit the &lt;kbd&gt;Select&lt;/kbd&gt; button. Tap the first photo. Touch and &lt;em&gt;don’t lift your finger from&lt;/em&gt; the next photo, then drag immediately to the end of the row. Keep dragging straight down through rows to select more rows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;TSelectAll_Citroen-911_850h.png-img&quot; class=&quot;splorpist&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://fawny.org/blogimages2017/SelectAll_Citroen-911_850h.png&quot; alt=&quot;Selecting many photos (11 with checkmarks)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Need to deselect a few? You can. Just tap them again (and you can drag through them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now you see with Adobe Lightroom has a select-all checkbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;TLightroom_selectall.png-img&quot; class=&quot;splorpist&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://fawny.org/blogimages2017/Lightroom_selectall.png&quot; alt=&quot;Lightroom with Select checkbox&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Apple does know, at a preconscious level, that selecting many or all pictures is an issue: In the Recently Deleted album, whose location changed in iOS 12 such that I couldn’t find it, you can Delete All in two presses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Fun fact: You can drag and drop photos in some albums, which I discovered by getting the sequence wrong that I just listed above.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remove the suggestion bar on your keyboard, which (again, after a decade) I have seen actually used &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; in Chinese and Japanese keyboards where you have no choice in the matter. (People can see it. They just do not use it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remove “apps” from Messages (that row of icons just below your text-entry field – nobody knows what they’re called, and few use or want them).&lt;/p&gt;

You discover this by accident as you get up from a restaurant table with your phone in your hand, only to be greeted with an &lt;samp&gt;Undo Typing&lt;/samp&gt; dialogue box. Unless you are an expert, you have no idea what just happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you really want and need the Undo feature, turn it on with AssistiveTouch. But AssistiveTouch itself has a diabolical user interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Yes, I have a Home button in my AssistiveTouch, as there are weird force-quit scenarios (yes, I force-quit apps) where it’s the only thing that works.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;Siri_201810hardtouse&quot;&gt;Siri is hard to use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like you, I can’t get Siri to set something up correctly on the first go more than three-quarters of the time. You shouldn’t have to talk a certain way to a virtual assistant. After this many years, he should understand you; he does not. (Siri is an Australian male.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set up an appointment with Fred tomorrow at two&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;“Which Fred?”&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;If it’s near midnight, he’ll ask you which day you mean&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;If you aren’t a savage and are using a 24-hour clock, he &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; get the time right no matter what you say&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;“Let me know if you want to make any changes.” “What does that mean?” “Sorry for being obtuse”&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;It turns out you can laboriously change any part of an item: “Change the time to 2:35”; “Change the title to ‘Late lunch’ ”&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;ul readability=&quot;6.4037037037037&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have your phone say out loud who’s calling you. This one is so pressing even David Pogue &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pogues-basics-have-your-iphone-announce-your-calls-212108695.html&quot; title=&quot;Pogue’s Basics: Have your iPhone announce your calls&quot;&gt;wrote about it&lt;/a&gt;. (Settings ☞ Phone ☞ Announce Calls.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change how Messages depicts the name of your contacts. Generally you just want first name or nickname, yes, not first name plus last initial? (Settings ☞ Contacts ☞ Short Name.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only people who need their screen to “lock” within only a few seconds are those in high-security jobs (and wary teenagers). Almost everybody else can function better with a lag time of several minutes. (Settings ☞ Display &amp;amp; Brightness ☞ Auto-Lock.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;scrolltotop&quot; readability=&quot;-21&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scroll to the top by tapping the clock. (Who would possibly discover that by accident? Somebody had to tell me about it.) Of course there’s no system-wide way to scroll to the bottom, because obviously that will never come up, because obviously no Apple software engineer has had to get to the very end of a list of 250 wedding guests in a hurry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;manual_201810hardtouse&quot;&gt;Did you know there’s a user manual?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the iBooks (or is it Books?) Store you can download an &lt;cite&gt;iPhone User Guide&lt;/cite&gt; for each major software version. There are usually iPad and sometimes iPod Touch user guides, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you do that (you won’t), you’ll find that almost nothing I have described here is covered. It &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; mention the ability to announce who’s calling you, but buries text size in the accessibility gulag, recapitulating the entire problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;w33&quot; /&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;stewed_201810hardtouse&quot;&gt;I sat and stewed about this posting for months. If nothing else, I need to keep it from becoming a script for a YouTube video about “hidden features” in iOS.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution</title>
<link>https://www.starterstory.com/blog/building-apps-for-shopify-fall-in-love-with-the-problem-not-the-solution</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.starterstory.com/blog/building-apps-for-shopify-fall-in-love-with-the-problem-not-the-solution</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the best pieces of advice I was given was to &lt;em&gt;Fall in love with the problem, not the solution&lt;/em&gt;. And it wasn’t until I came across a big problem that I realized how perfect this advice is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Ahmad Iqbal and I’m currently running two online businesses. I am both an Ecommerce Merchant as well as an Ecommerce App Developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first of the two is my online store where I &lt;a href=&quot;https://getnadeef.com/&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;sell hand-held bidets&lt;/a&gt;. The later business, borne of the need to increase bidet sales, guided me to designing and developing apps for other merchants, like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I want to illustrate how I made the leap from selling bidets online, to building an app design and development team. It’s strange for me to say it out loud, &quot;how does one go from selling butt cleaning appliances to building and marketing apps?&quot; So when Pat from Starter Story reached out to do a follow-up piece to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.starterstory.com/nadeef&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;my original post&lt;/a&gt; I was happy to try and put my experiences into words. Not just for others to read, but for myself in documenting my journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the title hasn’t already given it away, this will be about my relationship with Problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to start at the middle (quiting my job) and then go to 2015 when this 'starter story' actually started, followed by the meat and potatos of the frameworks we use in our app development model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.ctfassets.net/t0pm5m7uku03/LKwJRTkOw8y8icK0C4mI0/f3b095e49cb430d8309f2a7e87013581/Scout_Raven_Shopify_Apps__1_.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Scout Raven Shopify Apps (1)&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quitting my Job &amp;amp; Making Money through Shopify Apps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2015 to 2017 I was working full-time at a global Big Four firm as a Senior Technology Consultant. My job was to help Fortune 1000 companies get their products to market faster. During my time growing my bidet store, I was starting to become more and more immersed in growth marketing. So much so, that I spun out a marketing framework I used for myself and called it the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/ahmiq/agile-marketing-framework&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;&quot;Agile Marketing Framework&quot;&lt;/a&gt; for the firm. Everything I was learning on my own time for growing my own business, was helping me be better for my big clients at my job. But even though doing well at work felt great, it was WAY more fun helping small businesses. In 2017 I had decided the world needs better small businesses, not bigger big businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in order to quit my job (my Nadeef bidet sales were taking a hit with my attention now diverted between my demanding full-time job, app design/development, and supporting Scout merchants) I needed to figure out if building apps on Shopify would be a viable business model. Was it even possible to earn a living selling apps full time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed like a tough proposition. I would need thousands of merchants paying at least $20/month to create a successful business. I didn’t think it would be possible, until I came across the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.shopify.com/partners/shappify&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Bold Commerce&lt;/a&gt; story. This four person team in Winnipeg, Manitoba, had almost the same story as us. Merchants first, identified gaps in the app store, and deciding to build apps on Shopify. Bold Commerce now employs almost 300 people, with no outside funding to date, and with their growth solely on the Shopify platform. This case study was enough to convince us to take the leap, I wanted us to be like Bold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having decided it was in fact possible to build positive cash flows through app subscriptions on Shopify, next thing we had to do was get our financing organized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to take three months to prepare and think about if this problem was something we wanted to dedicate the next several years of our lives to. This three month period was my time to save as much money as I could, and test my own conviction. This time was a constant decision making cycle, where I continually asked myself if the market was big enough, if the problem was widespread enough, and if I had the right pieces in place. It was an important lesson from my first startup attempt almost seven years earlier. In my first startup we picked the wrong market, at the wrong time, with no experience or resources, and the result was a four year uphill campaign that left us in pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So before quitting my job, every dollar of income was saved, Bitcoins were cashed, plans to move out of my parent’s basement were halted, and I started creating a partner network across the ecommerce ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had enough to focus on building our apps for 36 months without worrying about money or raising venture capital. Today we’re on month 12 out of 36.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Let's Talk About the Failure First&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of jupming straight into Scout (the first app we built and the main subject of this post) let me first tell you about one of our apps that did not do well. Our &quot;hand-written&quot; notes app was attempted after the initial success of Scout, but it was a wake up call to stay focused on the problem, not the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After quitting my job, and landing on the bigger problem of customer experience as our company mandate (more on this later), we decided to offer hand-written note services. We figured customers would love getting a handwritten note from merchants, so with little else research, or testing, we went ahead and started building out this crazy printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-permalink=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/Bmi48moBWGG/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_medium=loading&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;12&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app would connect to your Shopify backend, identify your VIP customers, and then convert that customer information into a special Adobe Illustrator script that would feed into the printer. The printer then would proceed to start writing the notes in a handwritten style font (both the letter copy and the addresses on the envelope).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rolled this app out as an added skill to &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.shopify.com/scout-cart-recovery&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Scout&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, when Scout would alert you about the previous days’ VIP customers, it now offered an additional button labeled &quot;Send Handwrote Card&quot; which when pressed would instigate our printer. When the card was printed, I’d just have to put the postage stamp on it and drop it off at the post office which was across the street from our co-working space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe this idea failed because &lt;em&gt;I fell in love with the solution&lt;/em&gt; (cool looking robotic handwriting printer) rather than the problem it was designed to solve. I still believe there is value in this idea, but by overbuilding the solution first, we lost track of what was most important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to do it again I would have done a few things differently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Manually write and fulfill the cards myself while doing the merchant discovery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because there exists an intimate relationship between selling the service, and having to manually having to fulfill the service. It gives you more appreciation for the process and what’s important to do it successfully. Like with Scout, where I called my customers up manually through finding their details myself, and only after seeing how to do it well proceeded to systemize it with an app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Personally talk to each merchant who wanted cards written&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would have been the best (only?) way to validate the value of the service. How important is this service for merchants? What else do they wish they could give as 'thank you's? What price would they be willing to pay on high volume handwritten cards? How much does it bother them that the cards are not personally written by the brand, and hence not authentic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Write 0 lines of new code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why divert precious development time and resources on something if A) it’s possible to do manually, and B) there is no guarantee that it’s a lucrative idea?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking back, this idea was destined to fail for several reasons. Writing notes is very time consuming, there isn’t enough volume in the merchants who wanted to use it, the authenticity of the cards dies if customers figure out it’s not actually written by a person (even though it fooled almost anyone who looked at it). Even if we had done this the lean way and manually tested first, I still think we would have stopped offering the solution. But if I had just followed my four step Identify, Test, Build, Measure framework we would have saved the $4,000 we ended up spending designing and developing the software, and sourcing this printer and it’s parts. I would have found out in the Test section of the cycle that this is way too time consuming and merchants have too many questions about it to feel comfortable signing off on handwritten notes on high volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The handwritten note printer is now a piece of decoration at our office, but hey, at least it makes for a good conversation! And it taught me what I'm about to share with you today...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Identifying a Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rewind back to 2015, a few months after opening my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getnadeef.com&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Nadeef hand-held bidet&lt;/a&gt; store on Shopify I found myself tackling the abandoned checkout problem, something every merchants probably faces. For every three potential customers that reached the final stage of checkout, one wasn’t pulling out their credit card. The way I saw it, I was leaking 33% of my sales in the final, most crucial, &quot;moment of truth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was new to this field, I didn’t know the jargon or the best practices, all I knew was I needed to plug this hole. I went down a rabbit hole of recommendations, blog posts, forum threads, apps and YouTube videos. I tried many tactics, with varying degrees of &quot;success&quot; but later I realized I was asking myself the wrong question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of asking &quot;How can I recovery these sales?&quot; I should have been asking “Why are customer abandoning their checkout?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I tried to extrapolate why they abandoned through the default go-to answers most blog posts claim are the reasons, like shipping timeframes, pricing, return policies, etc. But I knew these weren’t the real issues causing the abandoned cart because I would address them in my auto-recovery emails, exit-popups, Facebook retargeting campaigns, or all the other ways I would try to reduce abandons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As simple as those recovery tactics may seem, I now know I was overthinking it. There was only one thing I could do to figure out why someone abandoned their checkout. Pick up the phone, and ask them one-on-one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I go on, I should state that my recovery rate at this point was around 10%. And Shopify’s dashboard told me this was a good thing. I just didn’t think that was good at all. It meant that for every 10 people who reached the final stage of their checkout only one person actually returned to buy? Sure it's better than $0, but what about the other 90% who aren't returning? Surely we could do better than 1/10...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and I wanted to talk to those nine people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling my abandoned checkout customers changed everything. It changed my whole perspective about how to do business, and it continues to change it even now. At first, there was hesitation to call up a customer out of the blue, but the desire to figure out the problem far outweighed any &quot;worst-case&quot; awkward conversation. Not to mention, they weren’t cold leads, these were highly interested customer who reached the final steps of making a purchase. In my head I kept telling myself this was exactly as if someone walked into a store, grabbed some items, placed them on the checkout counter, but just as they were about to pull out their wallet, they turned around and walked out the door. Wouldn’t the store owner ask what’s up? So I just smiled and dialled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were tremendous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went from recovering 10% of my abandoned checkouts from auto-emails, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@ahmadiqbal/the-evidence-scout-chatbot-lead-to-55-abandoned-cart-recovery-a18d84f5a8b7&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;to recovering 55% when I got them on the phone&lt;/a&gt;. Not only that but by gathering feedback and identifying holes in my offering the percentage of abandons slowly decreased as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve outlined my learnings from calling customers into the below diagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-permalink=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/Bmv3snuBUgD/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_medium=loading&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;12&quot;/&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Creating a Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw my process was working, but now I needed to systemize it so I could maintain consistency in my call backs. I quickly learned that the longer I waited to call the abandoned customer back the less likely I would be able to recovery the sale. I really just needed an alert app, one that would push notify me as soon as someone abandoned, tell me what products they left, and their phone number. There was nothing in the app store that provided this function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, there were tonnes of cart recovery apps available. The top results, the &quot;Top 10&quot; lists, all relied on exit-popups, and auto-emails. I didn’t want an app to take an auto-action by auto-sending an email, or auto-sending a Facebook message. I wanted to be told, so I could take action on it personally. I needed this because I learned how important the one-on-one relationship with my own customer was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I called up one of my friends, who was also the developer on my first start-up, and one weekend later Scout was born. It was stupid simple. 20 minutes after an abandoned checkout, Scout would email me with the key details I needed. When I got this email all I had to do was tap the phone number in the email and my phone would automatically start dialling. It wasn’t an exciting or sexy process. It wasn’t even very hard. There was no user interface to design, there was no website to develop, it was just a hacked prototype with one simple, useful, function. &lt;em&gt;If&lt;/em&gt; an abandoned checkout, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; email me. And it just took a weekend to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used this prototype of Scout for my own needs for several months. It was easier to manage because I was push notified when I needed to take an action. It maintained my high recovery rate. And most importantly, it was fun to know when an abandon happened in real-time, it made my site feel more alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having used it for a few months and not seeing any slowdown in its utility for my store, we decided this was a tactic every merchant should have in their sales strategy. We iterated on the first version of the email-only alert channel and made it a Facebook Messenger bot, sort of like a customer relationship focused personal assistant. Scout's job would be to alert merchants when a customer abandoned their checkout, and give you their checkout details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we published the free app in the Shopify App Store and &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.shopify.com/scout-cart-recovery#reviews&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;one review at a time&lt;/a&gt;, we realized it was as useful for many others as it was for us. Merchants were sending thank you emails to us, and it was here we felt we had found our first glimmer of that ever illusive &quot;Product-Market Fit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to remember, during this time both my friend and I had full-time jobs, and I was also running my bidet store. Scout was in no way near something resembling a business. And we didn’t approach it at all to be its own business. We just wanted to put something out into the world that would have an impact. Plain and simple. Our first few installs came organically from the Shopify App Store, and a few weeks later we had a small spike as a result of Felix Thea’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shopify.ca/blog/nadeef-bidet-abandoned-carts&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Shopify Masters Podcast&lt;/a&gt; where, as a guest I spoke about Nadeef and mentioned Scout. We didn’t do any marketing for it until we reached about 1,000 merchants through organic search, which took over a year to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It felt good making an impact for so many entrepreneurs, but we didn’t feel we had anything to quit our jobs for, yet…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is &quot;Product-Market Fit&quot;?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding product-market fit is a term used very frequently in the startup or entrepreneurial circles. If you’ve found product-market fit, it means you’ve figured out how to consistently deliver value to a group of people (and get paid as a result).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two components in this equation are &lt;em&gt;Product&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Market&lt;/em&gt;. In my experience, the key is to start with the market. It’s important to start with the market because that’s the big immovable environment you’re in. It’s uncertain, it’s changing, there are producers and consumers operating in it already. One can’t create a market, one can only play in it, and so the market is the &quot;hard part.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product side of the equation is the easy part. These days if you can dream it, you can figure out how to make it, or get it made. For example, if you want to build a skateboard that can be converted into a surfboard, you could probably figure that out. Let's assume you've done that, it looks great, and has tonnes of cool features like an intergrated smartphone app! Awesome, great work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now that it's built, who’s going to buy it? Where do they live, what's the population of all the surf-friendly cities? Who suffers badly enough from carrying two boards? How big is the problem? How much are people willing to pay for this? How often do they need to buy parts/replace their boards?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is, if you confident in your answers to the above questions and your ability to establish a distribution and marketing strategy to your ideal target market, then it makes sense to start product developerment. The same rules apply for app development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will clarify that I didn’t think Scout had enough of a product-market fit at the time. I thought we had found some fit, but we still had (have) a long way to go. After all, it is a free app and no one pays for it, so we don’t really have a way to measure if it valuable enough that people pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way this went down for us was simple. We were trying to solve my problem first. Being one of the participants in the &quot;market&quot; that had a problem with online sales, I slowly learned what I needed. And when I saw it helped/worked/was awesome, I had de-risked the product enough to feel comfortable going to market with it. In my case, it was as simple as publishing Scout to the app store AFTER knowing it was working for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-permalink=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BmgdhG7hpqh/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_medium=loading&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;12&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is again, why the advice of falling in love with the problem, is so great. Because it forces you to &lt;em&gt;think about the market, and its needs, first&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Iterating the Product&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward about a year after using Scout. I was looking through my list of customers, ordered from highest Lifetime Value (LTV) to lowest, and noticed something really fascinating. Eight out of my top 10 customers had originally abandoned their checkout and were individuals I had personally reached out over the phone. This means that by calling my abandoned checkout customers I was not only recovering the sale, but as a result they were turning into VIP customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a huge wake up call because it helped me understand the real problem in my online sales strategy. If calling my abandoned checkout customers resulted in them becoming loyal customers, what if I also called those who bought without abandoning? If the one-on-one phone call is the common denominator for the high retention rate, why not apply it to more customers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking back to the phone conversations over the previous 12 months I realized the most valuable bi-product of asking for feedback was not the sale itself. Rather, it was the lasting brand impression that a friendly, pre-sale service call had on my customer. Suddenly my high recovery rate made so much sense. The phone call earned trust with my customers and they were happy to come back and do business with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this realization came clarity about our app focus. Creating customer conversations. Customer relationships are today's small business competitive advantage. And so Scout had its first major iteration, the opportunity we've decided to pursue is to enable customer relationships. We decided Scout’s job for each and every merchant that installs it, is to identify these relationship building opportunities and turn them into one-on-one conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the below diagram (as opposed to the one earlier above) for explaining the concept in more detail because it outlines another key step, which is to test your hypothesis. Once you’ve identifying a new problem you want to solve, next thing you should do is run a test to see if your solution will work. If you can solve it, then you should build something to systemize it. If you can’t at least prove your hypothesis is true even a little bit, then I wouldn’t recommend investing more time in building a systemized solution (the product).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-permalink=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BmtVRiFh-a2/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_medium=loading&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;12&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve gone through the loop at least once, you should have identified opportunities for improvements, and this is where Scout is today. Currently we feel we’re on the Learn phase in our third loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who are interested in the math of our second &quot;Measure&quot; step as it related to my store’s results after 12 months using using Scout:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My top 10 customers had spent at least $600 on my store, through an average of 3 or more purchases. My top three had spent at least $1,000 in 5+ orders. As a comparison, the average customer LTV is $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eight out of my top 10 overall customers were originally abandoned checkouts that I had called and recovered. They went on to be way more likely to become returning and word-of-mouth customers. Based on this, it was safe to say I needed to focus on getting more people on the phone, regardless of whether they abandoned first or not. This was the most recent learning which fueled the next round of product iterations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Generating Installs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shopify App Store is pretty saturated today. There are so many apps on there already, many popular apps even have dozens of copycats. This makes it hard to market apps to merchants, because there is so much noise that’s keeping them from finding your app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I had some secret formula we used to grow our installs. What I will say is that the vast majority of installs come straight from app store ranking, which I believe is mostly dependant on the number of 5 star reviews and your usable of the right keywords. I’ve added a screenshot of our first 9 months below to show you what the growth looked like in the early days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.ctfassets.net/t0pm5m7uku03/1NbjcAuXlqqi0s0E8IKwe0/c6e04f177ac27710a1e03c1ffc6c24c8/first_9_months_installs&quot; alt=&quot;first 9 months installs&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that for the first 4 months, we only generated 20 installs. And three of those were from my own store and a couple friends’. The other 17 I believe probably came from the Shopify Master Podcast that I was featured on. To be fair, remember that at this time we were not focused on Scout at all. I had my full-time job, as well as my bidet store, so there were no marketing efforts put into Scout whatsoever. So how did the growth suddenly pick up in January 2017?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe it had a lot to do with positive merchant reviews of the app. I think the app store’s algorithms started picking up the reviews we were generating and this caused a sort of upward cycle. Based on this, my advice would be, in order to grow your app installs, focus on your merchant support. Offer the best customer support you possibly can, and keep providing this level of support. It’s worked for us in the past, and it continues to work for us. Every few weeks when we generate several positive reviews in quick succession we watch our installs over the next few days, and it is noticeably larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like the theme of our apps, of enabling merchants to provide great customer experience, we do the same for our service. We are an app development merchant to business owners. We saw it working in terms of making product sales online, why wouldn’t it work for app companies trying to sell to other businesses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far the story checks out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Customer Experience is Important (because it’s hard)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my research around ecommerce success stories, I came across Zappos. Their business model was so on point I had to create some content around it in the form of several vlogs. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scout-merchant-home.webflow.io/&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Our series of vlogs&lt;/a&gt; talks about several topics around small businesses, especially the advantage that we have as small businesses. Hint: it has a lot to do with our ability to provide a superior customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get back to Zappos, Zappos is an online shoe store based in Las Vegas, Nevada, that was eventually acquired by Amazon for $1.2 billion. It just sold shoes, the same shoes you’d find in any regular store, but it did so with a militant focus on the customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They do this so well that their business has a 75% repurchase rate. Even though it's an online retail business model, I strongly feel the same principles apply to all sorts of models, including SaaS, consulting, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how did Zappos do this? They did this by reinvesting a portion of each sale’s revenue, back into the customer’s experience. So instead of taking $20 from $100 sale and giving it to Facebook or Google ads in the hope of acquiring a new customer, they would use that $20 to upgrade their shipping to overnight, send a free pizza, or offer unlimited free returns. This not only made sure they retained the customer (repurchasing customers spent more and bought more frequently), but they also created free word-of-mouth customers through the advocate marketing as a result of the great experience. Tony Hsieh, the CEO of Zappos went on to write a book called &lt;em&gt;Delivering Happiness&lt;/em&gt; about this idea, which I would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Delivering-Happiness-Profits-Passion-Purpose/dp/0446576220/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1534191569&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=delivering+happiness&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;highly reccommend&lt;/a&gt; for all merchants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of great books, another book also further opened my eyes to the lost opportunities at businesses who don’t focus on the customer experience. Joey Coleman’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Never-Lose-Customer-Again-Lifelong/dp/0735220034&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Never Lose a Customer Again&lt;/a&gt; opening chapter highlights an interesting ratio of 43:1. For every 43 books about sales or marketing, there is only one book about customer service, experience, or retention. That means the education around creating a customer far outweighs the education around keeping the customer. But why? It's a known fact retention provides more profitability than new acqusitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about why this is, I believe it has less to do with the difficulty of creating &quot;wow&quot; customer experiences, and more to do with how ridiculously easy it is to automate ads and marketing campaigns. I don’t think we’re against doing hard things, but when presented with the easy option, that’s what merchants will take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-permalink=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BaFgvoblF44/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_medium=loading&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;12&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the &quot;orthodox&quot; marketing tactics can be automated (and they can), you should also incorporate the unorthodox campaigns. Things like sending a free pizza and handwritten thank you notes, will close the loop for a complete marketing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re marketing physical goods, or SaaS apps, or even professional services, it’s easy to want to automate everything. Automating Facebook and Google ads, automating email campaigns, automating chatbots, automating discounts, popups, and special offers, automating dropshipping; it’s really easy to do this, and the app stores are overflowing with apps that automate. It’s clear automation is the future, but there is no competitive advantage here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so in order to stand out, I’ve learned you can’t automate the hard things. You should try to do the important hard things personally, because it’s in those moments that you will build brand reputation and value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More than One Solution (to the Problem)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went from running a Shopify store earning several thousand dollars per month, to developing a suite of apps used by over 10,000 merchants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on Scout, and seeing the success from it, we started ideating other ways of getting customers on the phone. Why does only an abandoned checkout need to result in the phone call? What if a customer is interested in purchasing but hasn’t clicked &quot;add to cart&quot; yet? To capture these unrealized leads we developed the callback app called &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.shopify.com/raven&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Raven Callback&lt;/a&gt;. Raven turns website visits into qualified sales calls. It helped tremendously on my store, because it started to capture more leads due to its lightweight nature. I didn't think the contact/email form was working for me because it’s too much stuff for customers to type, and they perceive replies would take up to 48 hours, so why bother? Same with the livechat, since majority of &lt;strong&gt;small businesses&lt;/strong&gt; don’t reply immediately. The “immediate” callback did wonders and customers continuously commented it was the best customer service they’ve experienced. So, we ran with Raven as well, based on the success I had with my own store we published it on the Shopify App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raven only has a few dozen merchants on our paid plans, but just those merchants have directly generated over $500,000 for themselves in sales over the past 3 months since we launched. Again, we’re seeing the phone channel as a great medium to close sales, and it works really well for certain products and services. I think any store that wants to have one-on-one conversations with customers, especially those who sell products over $200, should seriously consider the phone as a sales channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s Next&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we’re working on publishing our third app, again, inspired from running my bidet store. It’s not phone related, but it is related to customer experience and building a relationship with your VIP customers. The app is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getpizzaparty.com&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Pizza Party&lt;/a&gt;, and it sends free pizzas to those VIP customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the learnings from the &quot;failed&quot; hand-written note product, this time, I'm focusing on more customer conversations about it before going ahead and publishing the app. We're not sure yet when we'll officially launch it, it's about half-way done, but I'm happy to chat with anyone who wants to use it for their store. It’s really fun and easy to use. When merchants install it they just outline the parameters of a &quot;great&quot; customer, like order value, lifetime value or order frequency, and then confirm which customers to send to. For example, if you consider any customer who spends at least $200 per order on your store as a “VIP” customer, then Pizza Party will send a free “thank you” pizza to that customer on your behalf. The merchant pays for the pizza, and we take a small percentage, but it’s super easy to get started and really fun to use. The feedback I was getting from my bidet customers who I sent free pizzas was just too awesome to pass up on this app idea. I sent free large cheese pizzas to customers who bought a few hundred dollars worth of bidets last winter and that small token of my appreciation turned into a few hundred dollars in more revenue; it was triple digit ROI. Customers said it was the best customer service they’ve ever had, ended up sharing the story with their friends, which then resulted in word-of-mouth sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve read this far you’ve probably put together the pattern here. I tried a marketing experiment for my Nadeef Bidet store, and if it worked really well I tried to systemize it. By focusing on solving our own problems first, we now have 3 apps, 3 more in private beta, and plans to roll out for several other platforms very soon. And thanks for reading!

<title>AWS CEO Jassy follows Apple in calling for retraction of Chinese spy chip story</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/22/aws-ceo-jassy-follows-apple-calls-for-spy-chip-story-retraction.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy Jassy, the CEO of &lt;a class=&quot;inline_quotes&quot; data-gdsid=&quot;9399&quot; data-inline-quote-symbol=&quot;AMZN&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AMZN&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; Web Services, followed Apple's lead in calling the for the retraction of Bloomberg's story about spy chips being embedded in servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They offered no proof, story kept changing, and showed no interest in our answers unless we could validate their theories,&quot; Jassy wrote in a tweet on Monday. &quot;Reporters got played or took liberties. Bloomberg should retract.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;embed-container twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ajassy/status/1054401346827243520?s=21&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple CEO &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/tim-cook/&quot;&gt;Tim Cook&lt;/a&gt; told Buzzfeed on Friday that the scenario Bloomberg reported never happened and that the October story in Bloomberg Businessweek &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/19/apples-tim-cook-calls-for-retraction-on-chinese-spy-chip-story.html&quot;&gt;should be retracted&lt;/a&gt;. Bloomberg &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/04/chinese-spy-chips-are-said-to-be-found-in-hardware-used-by-apple-amazon-apple-denies-the-bloomberg-businessweek-report.html&quot;&gt;alleged data center hardware&lt;/a&gt; used by Apple and AWS, and provided by server company &lt;a class=&quot;inline_quotes&quot; data-gdsid=&quot;56045&quot; data-inline-quote-symbol=&quot;SMCI&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=SMCI&quot;&gt;Super Micro&lt;/a&gt;, was under surveillance by the Chinese government, even though almost all the companies named in the report denied Bloomberg's claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg published a denial from AWS alongside its own report, and AWS refuted the report in a more strongly worded six-paragraph &lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/setting-the-record-straight-on-bloomberg-businessweeks-erroneous-article/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; entitled &quot;Setting the Record Straight on Bloomberg Businessweek's Erroneous Article.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg story said that servers from Super Micro in AWS Beijing data centers contained malicious chips, which were also found in servers from Elemental Technologies, a company AWS acquired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There are so many inaccuracies in ‎this article as it relates to Amazon that they're hard to count,&quot; Steve Schmidt, chief information security officer at AWS, wrote in the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also on Monday, Super Micro told shareholders that it sent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/22/super-micro-to-review-chips-in-light-of-media-report-on-hacking.html&quot;&gt;a letter to customers&lt;/a&gt; informing them that it's conducting a &quot;complicated and time-consuming review to further address the article&quot; even as it lacks proof of the sort of malicious chips that Bloomberg had described.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WATCH: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/10/09/super-micro-plunges-on-new-report-of-hacked-hardware-in-us.html&quot;&gt;Super Micro plunges on new report of hacked hardware in US&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

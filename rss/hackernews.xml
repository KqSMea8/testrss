<title>Medium is a poor choice for blogging</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn&quot; readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;afc0&quot; id=&quot;afc0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Many people choose Medium lately as their go-to platform to blog. Kind of like Blogger a while back, it just seems what everybody has been doing (unless you are really nit-picky and care enough to host your own thing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8904&quot; id=&quot;8904&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;And kind of like Blogger, Medium is a terrible thing for publishing. If you think about publishing an article, starting a blog or even just sharing a short rant on Medium, please consider what you’ll be putting your readers through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;641f&quot; id=&quot;641f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Every Medium article will greet &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;each&lt;/em&gt; person who opens your link with a huge full-page banner &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;every time&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*6Mu_U4dUXP5uzebamoUYaw.png&quot; data-width=&quot;2560&quot; data-height=&quot;1554&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*6Mu_U4dUXP5uzebamoUYaw.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*6Mu_U4dUXP5uzebamoUYaw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn&quot; readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6aca&quot; id=&quot;6aca&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;If they open your link on a phone, Medium will really, really, really insist on installing an app. I guess reading text from a webpage is too old-school:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*YydCukQpUYFjrbGw1sW0BQ@2x.png&quot; data-width=&quot;750&quot; data-height=&quot;1334&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*YydCukQpUYFjrbGw1sW0BQ@2x.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*YydCukQpUYFjrbGw1sW0BQ@2x.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fe89&quot; id=&quot;fe89&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Medium is advertising itself as a reader-oriented experience. At the same time, most of Medium articles look and read &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; than just plaintext HTML. If you get through banners and set down to read anything, you will be surrounded by HUGE sticky header, sticky footer and sticky social media controls:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*PEEiieiArEeemd4IY-9F6A.png&quot; data-width=&quot;2318&quot; data-height=&quot;1300&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*PEEiieiArEeemd4IY-9F6A.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*PEEiieiArEeemd4IY-9F6A.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c9bf&quot; id=&quot;c9bf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;No, those do not go away as you scroll. They literally (yes, literally) take up 25% of your vertical space (and vertical space is very valuable, especially for text columns and horizontal screens):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*s-ov4Rl0RfrPRnpzE6n3Tw.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1159&quot; data-height=&quot;650&quot; data-is-featured=&quot;true&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*s-ov4Rl0RfrPRnpzE6n3Tw.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*s-ov4Rl0RfrPRnpzE6n3Tw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Are you sure I have to look at this 2-storey 100px header ALL THE TIME?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c526&quot; id=&quot;c526&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;For contrast, this is how it could’ve look like without Medium styling: nice and pleasant to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*M6lZhKNYvdAoaDDOcqGUlw.png&quot; data-width=&quot;2314&quot; data-height=&quot;1304&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*M6lZhKNYvdAoaDDOcqGUlw.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*M6lZhKNYvdAoaDDOcqGUlw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cdd6&quot; id=&quot;cdd6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I mean, you don’t have to do &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; special with text, it was designed to look fine by default. You had one job: don’t mess it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6212&quot; id=&quot;6212&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Every time you select text an annoying popup shows up. And if you accidentally click it (which is really easy to do because it pops up right under your cursor) you’ll be redirected to the login page (and lose your reading position) because God forbids unauthenticated users would try to do &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; with their &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;platform&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*LC5yoqj1ZGHKxSE0th8cyQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;261&quot; data-height=&quot;140&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*LC5yoqj1ZGHKxSE0th8cyQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ccee&quot; id=&quot;ccee&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;So scroll, but do not touch. In spite of the fact that it’s a plain freaking text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;69fc&quot; id=&quot;69fc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But maybe that popup is useful? I don’t know. Take me, for example. I’m perfectly capable of posting links and quotes on Twitter without any popup menus (and without converting them into an image first). In fact, popup menu makes it &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;harder&lt;/em&gt; for me because I can’t safely select text and adjust selection anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*i7jmGKpx7rb_YBlyg7Z_6A@2x.png&quot; data-width=&quot;800&quot; data-height=&quot;442&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*i7jmGKpx7rb_YBlyg7Z_6A@2x.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*i7jmGKpx7rb_YBlyg7Z_6A@2x.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9785&quot; id=&quot;9785&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;And yes, it does attach an image of you selecting a text on Medium instead of just quoting the text. What a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*B2kMLAaHHEoqRinAPSeF4Q.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1196&quot; data-height=&quot;821&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*B2kMLAaHHEoqRinAPSeF4Q.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*B2kMLAaHHEoqRinAPSeF4Q.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
This is an image attached here, not a text quote
&lt;p name=&quot;cad2&quot; id=&quot;cad2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;But the misadventures do not end here. If anyone decides to blog on Medium regularly, there’s no way to follow them through RSS. I mean Medium does serve RSS, but they serve it with replies and it turns the whole idea into a non-usable mess. You just get random phrases with no context in your feed instead of articles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*PurGFcNPJIiHObKGnwZ2Hg.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1976&quot; data-height=&quot;676&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*PurGFcNPJIiHObKGnwZ2Hg.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*PurGFcNPJIiHObKGnwZ2Hg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6e42&quot; id=&quot;6e42&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;You can always follow people on Medium, you would say. Sort of, but Medium does not have a non-algorithmic (linear, that is) feed. Look at this mess:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*d0Vw7y0UwE2uS4S6phng3A.png&quot; data-width=&quot;2562&quot; data-height=&quot;1556&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*d0Vw7y0UwE2uS4S6phng3A.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*d0Vw7y0UwE2uS4S6phng3A.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;635d&quot; id=&quot;635d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Look how dates are all over the place. What happened here? And I only get to access the 15 latest publications? At least I hope they are latest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8227&quot; id=&quot;8227&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Another interesting point is that they are really eager to block embeds that do not respect Do Not Track header but do not respect DNT themselves. Yes, Medium will collect your profile even if you are not a registered user and explicitly ask them not to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*_P71qxrtmdnc_4kJVj1wDw.png&quot; data-width=&quot;2316&quot; data-height=&quot;1306&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*_P71qxrtmdnc_4kJVj1wDw.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*_P71qxrtmdnc_4kJVj1wDw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;96c1&quot; id=&quot;96c1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Putting letters on a webpage is “impossible” without collecting your profile. Or so they say. Static HTML is not disruptive enough, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*pW4p1Fh6LLtsFAXXFyRiBg.png&quot; data-width=&quot;2258&quot; data-height=&quot;222&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*pW4p1Fh6LLtsFAXXFyRiBg.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*pW4p1Fh6LLtsFAXXFyRiBg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn&quot; readability=&quot;30&quot;&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1fba&quot; id=&quot;1fba&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;And it has been a common theme with them. Instead of becoming nice citizens and do what other websites do, they turned themselves into a closed silo that’s either all or nothing. No RSS. Bad reading experience, and I want to highlight it: it’s bad. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Bad&lt;/strong&gt;. Really bad. It’s not good, for &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; meaning of good you can imagine. There’s no person on Earth who could honestly call it at even partially good. Banners all over the place. Aggressive tracking and profiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e22f&quot; id=&quot;e22f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;UPD: Cookie banner. Really slow UI for replies/discussions. Other people highlights that interrupt your reading flow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;babd&quot; id=&quot;babd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Each one of your readers&lt;/em&gt; will have to go through &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;ALL&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;THAT&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;EACH&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;TIME&lt;/em&gt; just to occasionally read a couple of paragraphs of text. It’s fascinating, really, how they managed to make plain text so complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;547d&quot; id=&quot;547d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Sure, Medium editor is nice. Typography is good (for English, other languages are not supported). Publishing is free. So the ones who pay for all that are your readers. Basically, you’re selling readers to aggressive Medium self-advertising so that Medium could make laughably small money from a miserable fraction of them. And annoy the hell out of everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*Tj3mtf12OrwzelbTIwV_bQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;2560&quot; data-height=&quot;1554&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*Tj3mtf12OrwzelbTIwV_bQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Tj3mtf12OrwzelbTIwV_bQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
hear, hear&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2ba8&quot; id=&quot;2ba8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing&quot;&gt;Next time you think of publishing anything on the web, please, please, PLEASE consider something else.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Internet Vulnerability Takes Down Google</title>
<link>https://blog.thousandeyes.com/internet-vulnerability-takes-down-google/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.thousandeyes.com/internet-vulnerability-takes-down-google/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;On November 12th, 2018, between 1:00 PM and 2:23 PM PST, ThousandEyes noticed issues connecting to G Suite, a critical application for our organization. Reviewing ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent stats, we noticed this was impacting all users at the ThousandEyes office. The outage not only affected G Suite, but also Google Search as well as Google Analytics. What caught our attention was that traffic to Google was getting dropped at China Telecom. Why would traffic from a San Francisco office traversing to Google go all the way to China? We also noticed a Russian ISP in the traffic path, which definitely sparked some concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.thousandeyes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Figure-1-Endpoint-agent-path-visualization-China.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 1: Traffic from ThousandEyes users in San Francisco getting dropped in China.&quot; title=&quot;Figure 1: Traffic from ThousandEyes users in San Francisco getting dropped in China.&quot; width=&quot;1058&quot; height=&quot;850&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-5015&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure 1: Traffic from ThousandEyes users in San Francisco getting dropped in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon further investigation, we saw that several ThousandEyes vantage points around the globe were reporting similar unusual traffic routing, all terminating at China Telecom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.thousandeyes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Figure-2-Google-path-visualization-blackholed.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 2: Traffic from multiple locations to Google getting black-holed at China Telecom.&quot; title=&quot;Figure 2: Traffic from multiple locations to Google getting black-holed at China Telecom.&quot; width=&quot;1035&quot; height=&quot;741&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-5016&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure 2: Traffic from multiple locations to Google getting black-holed at China Telecom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThousandEyes BGP Route Visualization painted an interesting picture. Traffic from Paris to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Google&quot;&gt;www.google.com&lt;/a&gt; resolved to 216.58.204.132. While Google announces many /24 prefixes to cover its IP address range, this address was not covered by a /24 prefix. Instead, it was covered by a /19 prefix. We saw a suspicious announcement for 216.58.192.0/19 appear after about 12:45 pm PST with a convoluted AS path that included TransTelecom (AS 20485) in Russia, China Telecom (AS 4809) in China and MainOne (AS 37282), a small ISP in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.thousandeyes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Figure-3-BGP-route-visualization-best-path-to-Google-via-Russia-China-Nigeria.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 3: Suspicious announcement for 216.58.192.0/19.&quot; title=&quot;Figure 3: Suspicious announcement for 216.58.192.0/19 showing the best path to Google via Russia, China and Nigeria.&quot; width=&quot;969&quot; height=&quot;504&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-5014&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure 3: Suspicious announcement for 216.58.192.0/19 showing the best path to Google via Russia, China and Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traffic paths we saw mirrored the BGP AS Path, except all the traffic slammed into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.thousandeyes.com/deconstructing-great-firewall-china/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Deconstructing the Great Firewall of China&quot;&gt;great firewall&lt;/a&gt;, terminating at China Telecom edge router.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incident at a minimum caused a massive denial of service to G Suite and Google Search. However, this also put valuable Google traffic in the hands of ISPs in countries with a long history of Internet surveillance. Overall ThousandEyes detected over 180 prefixes affected by this route leak, which covers a vast scope of Google services. Our analysis indicates that the origin of this leak was the BGP peering relationship between MainOne, the Nigerian provider, and China Telecom. MainOne has a peering relationship with Google via IXPN in Lagos and has direct routes to Google, which leaked into China Telecom. While we don’t know if this was a misconfiguration or a malicious act, these leaked routes propagated from China Telecom, via TransTelecom to NTT and other transit ISPs. We also noticed that this leak was primarily propagated by business-grade transit providers and did not impact consumer ISP networks as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incident further underscores one of the fundamental weaknesses in the fabric of the Internet. BGP was designed to be a chain of trust between well-meaning ISPs and universities that blindly believe the information they receive. It hasn’t evolved to reflect the complex commercial and geopolitical relationships that exist between ISPs and nations today. While verification methods like ROA exist, few ISPs use them. Even corporations like Google with massive resources at their disposal are not immune from such BGP hijacks and leaks. Google took nearly two hours to resolve the issue. Most enterprises may not be able to resolve the issue as quickly, which can significantly impact business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BGP-related incidents have been on the rise. In April 2018 we saw a brazen &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.thousandeyes.com/amazon-route-53-dns-and-bgp-hijack/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Anatomy of a BGP Hijack on Amazon's Route 53 DNS Service&quot;&gt;cryptocurrency heist&lt;/a&gt; involving the hijack of an entire DNS provider (Route 53). Just a year before that, in April 2017, we saw the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.thousandeyes.com/rostelecom-route-leak-targets-ecommerce-services/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Rostelecom Route Leak Targets E-Commerce Services&quot;&gt;Rostelecom BGP route leak&lt;/a&gt; which affected a large number of e-commerce and financial services websites. While the ISP community recognizes the scope of the problem, and solutions such as ROA and IRR filtering exist, none of them are silver bullets and implementing them risks breaking the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of guarantees, enterprises need to continuously monitor their BGP routes and detect such incidents quickly in order to mitigate any service impacts to their business. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thousandeyes.com/resources/detecting-hijacks-and-leaks-webinar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Detecting Hijacks and Leaks&quot;&gt;Learn more&lt;/a&gt; about how you can use ThousandEyes to detect BGP hijacks and leaks. &lt;a class=&quot;inline-subscribe-textlink&quot; title=&quot;Subscribe&quot; data-subscribe-modal=&quot;on&quot;&gt;Subscribe to the ThousandEyes blog&lt;/a&gt; to stay up to date on outage analyses like these and best practices on delivering a reliable Internet experience.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Cadbury ‘pushing orangutans towards extinction by wrecking habitat for palm oil’</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;The maker of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/cadbury&quot;&gt;Cadbury&lt;/a&gt; chocolate bars, Oreo biscuits and Ritz crackers is accused of destroying tens of thousands of hectares of orangutan habitat in just two years for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/palm-oil&quot;&gt;palm oil&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppliers to food giant &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/mondelez&quot;&gt;Mondelez&lt;/a&gt; have destroyed 70,000 hectares since 2016, analysis by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Greenpeace&quot;&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt; International claims, pushing the primate further towards extinction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The areas razed to the ground include 25,000 hectares of habitations in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Indonesia&quot;&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; that are home to the critically endangered orangutan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-block inline-related align-left item-count-4&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;box-title&quot;&gt;Read more&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mondelez, which is one of the world’s biggest buyers of palm oil, uses it in many of its most popular products, including Cadbury and Roses chocolates, Oreos and Ritz crackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new investigation, carried out through mapping Indonesia, discovered that between 2015 and 2017, 22 of the company’s palm oil suppliers cleared at least 70,000 hectares of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Rainforest&quot;&gt;rainforest&lt;/a&gt; – an area bigger than the City of Chicago, where Mondelez is based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 31-page report detailing the supply chains of the main brands the charity says are responsible for destruction, Greenpeace points the finger largely at the producer of some of Britain’s favourite chocolates and snacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report says that although Mondelez claims to have been purchasing entirely responsible palm oil since 2013, “in practice almost 95 per cent of the palm oil it buys is covered by ‘book-and-claim’ certificates – by far the weakest of the certification models offered by the main palm oil industry body, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO)”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orangutans are literally dying for a biscuit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Greenpeace’s Kiki Taufik
&lt;p&gt;“This means that the plantations and producer groups from which the overwhelming majority of the palm oil that Mondelez purchases is sourced are not governed by any sustainability initiatives,” the study claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace’s campaign against destructive palm oil hit the headlines over the weekend when a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/iceland-christmas-advert-2018-deforestation-palm-oil-greenpeace-emma-thompson-political-a8625381.html&quot;&gt;video that Iceland repurposed for a Christmas advert&lt;/a&gt; was banned from television for being “political”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaigners have warned “it’s now or never” for Indonesia’s critically endangered orangutans, which are being killed at a rate of 25 a day as natural vegetation is bulldozed to make way for palm plantations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rang-tan: Iceland’s banned TV Christmas advert protests palm oil industry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September this year Greenpeace International published Final Countdown, a report that showed Mondelez was sourcing palm oil from 22 of 25 destructive producer groups. “Alarmingly, these are just the cases that Greenpeace was able to identify – Mondelez sources from hundreds of palm oil companies and this destruction is likely just the tip of the iceberg,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orangutans are critically endangered (&lt;span class=&quot;scayt-misspell-word&quot; data-scayt-word=&quot;istock&quot; data-wsc-lang=&quot;en_GB&quot;&gt;istock&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiki Taufik, head of Greenpeace Southeast Asia’s Indonesia forests campaign, said: “It’s outrageous that despite promising to clean up its palm oil almost 10 years ago, Mondelez is still trading with forest destroyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Palm oil can be made without destroying forests, yet our investigation discovered that Mondelez suppliers are still trashing forests and wrecking orangutan habitat, pushing these beautiful and intelligent creatures to the brink of extinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re literally dying for a biscuit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bornean &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/orangutans&quot;&gt;orangutan&lt;/a&gt; numbers have halved in 16 years, studies show, and both the Sumatran and newly discovered Tapanuli orangutan lost more than half their habitat between 1985 and 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three species are classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as critically endangered, along with the Sumatran tiger and Sumatran rhino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Mondelez International told &lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt; the company was committed to eradicating deforestation in the palm oil supply and it was actively working with suppliers to ensure palm oil was fully traceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re calling on our suppliers to further map and monitor the plantations where oil is grown so we can drive further traceability. We’re excluding 12 upstream suppliers from our supply chain who have not met our standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For many years we have been calling for 100 per cent sustainable and we’re making good progress on our palm oil action plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This includes actionable steps to ensure the palm oil we buy is produced on legally held land, does not lead to deforestation or loss of peat land, respects human rights and does not use forced or child labour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At the end of 2017, 96 per cent of our palm oil was traceable back to mill and 99 per cent was from suppliers with policies aligned to ours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She added that Mondelez was calling on suppliers to improve practices and to engage third-party suppliers to ensure production was fully sustainable and traceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will continue to prioritise suppliers that meet our principles, and exclude those that don’t,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

      withheld information about potential hazards associated with a new flight-control feature suspected of playing a role in last month’s fatal Lion Air jet crash, according to safety experts involved in the investigation, as well as midlevel FAA officials and airline pilots.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;div class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The automated stall-prevention system on Boeing 737 MAX 8 and MAX 9 models—intended to help cockpit crews avoid mistakenly raising a plane’s nose dangerously high—under unusual conditions can push it down unexpectedly and so strongly that flight crews can’t pull it back up. Such a scenario, Boeing told airlines in a world-wide safety bulletin roughly a week after the accident, can result in a steep dive or crash—even if pilots are manually flying the jetliner and don’t expect flight-control computers to kick in.&lt;/p&gt;




      




      &lt;p&gt;That warning came as a surprise to many pilots who fly the latest models for U.S carriers. Safety experts involved in and tracking the investigation said that at U.S. carriers, neither airline managers nor pilots had been told such a system had been added to the latest 737 variant—and therefore aviators typically weren’t prepared to cope with the possible risks.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;“It’s pretty asinine for them to put a system on an airplane and not tell the pilots who are operating the airplane, especially when it deals with flight controls,” said Capt. Mike Michaelis,  chairman of the safety committee for the Allied Pilots Association, which represents about 15,000

    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt; 




      &lt;p&gt;One Federal Aviation Administration manager familiar with the details said the new flight-control systems weren’t highlighted in any training materials or during lengthy discussions between carriers and regulators about phasing in the latest 737 derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Boeing declined to immediately answer specific questions Monday. “We are taking every measure to fully understand all aspects of this incident, working closely with the investigating team and all regulatory authorities involved,” the company said in a statement. “We are confident in the safety of the 737 MAX.”&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;On Monday, an FAA statement reiterated that the agency had mandated flight manual changes to emphasize proper pilot responses to the new flight-control systems. “The FAA will take further action if findings from the accident investigation warrant,” the statement noted, but declined to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Boeing marketed the MAX 8 partly by telling customers it wouldn’t need pilots to undergo additional simulator training beyond that already required for older versions, according to industry and government officials. One high-ranking Boeing official said the company had decided against disclosing more details to cockpit crews due to concerns about inundating average pilots with too much information—and significantly more technical data—than they needed or could digest. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt; Minutes after takeoff from Jakarta in good weather, Lion Air Flight 610 experienced problems with airspeed indicators and a related system that feeds data to computers about the angle of the nose. The crash killed all 189 people on board.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Investigators haven’t described the precise sequence of events that caused the twin-engine jet to plummet into the Java Sea at a steep angle and high speed. But Indonesian authorities already have called for stepped-up pilot training and suggested they are delving into design issues. In the U.S. at least, substantial training changes will have to wait until new flight simulators are delivered to carriers.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;The focus of the probe is shifting away from its early emphasis on individual system malfunctions and suspected pilot mistakes, according to people tracking developments. &lt;/p&gt;




      




      &lt;p&gt;Instead, these people said, U.S. and Indonesian crash investigators increasingly are delving into the way the MAX 8’s automated flight-control systems interact with each other, and how rigorously the FAA and Boeing analyzed potential hazards in the event some of them malfunction and feed incorrect or unreliable data to the plane’s computers. Swiftly turning off the automated feature is the solution in such cases. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Earlier 737 versions have different stall-protection systems, that don’t automatically drive down the nose even when other functions of the plane’s autopilot are turned off. Yet operation of those older systems was highlighted in training over the years, and pilots had to memorize steps to counteract potentially dangerous unintended consequences. MAX 8 training materials don’t include a requirement to memorize the steps to turn off the stall-protection system.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Stepped-up scrutiny of the latest 737 MAX features applies to more than 200 of the models that have been delivered to customers around the world, including






            &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/LUV&quot;&gt;Southwest Airlines&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;


      American Airlines and United Airlines. Boeing’s 737 factory near Seattle currently churns out 52 planes a month.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;“We’re pissed that Boeing didn’t tell the companies and the pilots didn’t get notice obviously, as well,” said Capt. Jon Weaks,  president of Southwest Airlines Co.’s pilot union. “But what we need now is...to make sure there is nothing else Boeing has not told the companies or the pilots.”&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Like Mr. Weaks, some FAA managers and industry officials aren’t satisfied with what they contend is Boeing’s belated candor.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Boeing is working on a software fix, according to industry and government officials, that would likely mitigate risks. On Saturday, the company went further than before in spelling out dangers pilots can face if they misinterpret or respond too slowly to counter automated commands.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;In a message sent to all 737 operators, and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, the Chicago plane maker explained in painstaking detail the engineering principles and operational parameters behind the latest automation.&lt;/p&gt;






      &lt;div data-layout=&quot;wrap&amp;#10;              &quot; data-layout-mobile=&quot;inline&quot; class=&quot;&amp;#10;        media-object&amp;#10;        type-InsetNewsletterSignup&amp;#10;          wrap&amp;#10;    scope-web|mobileapps&amp;#10;  article__inset&amp;#10;        article__inset--type-InsetNewsletterSignup&amp;#10;            article__inset--wrap&amp;#10;  &quot;&gt;
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
          &lt;div class=&quot;strap-container&quot;&gt;
      &lt;h4 class=&quot;strap&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Newsletter Sign-up&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    

      
      
      &lt;/div&gt; 




      &lt;p&gt;That message was more detailed than the bulletin Boeing voluntarily issued earlier, alerting pilots about the potential hazard—and touching off debate over the stall-prevention system’s design. Within hours, the FAA followed up with its emergency directive mandating changes in flight manuals.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Such interim efforts “are very appropriate in the near term to increase pilot awareness,” said John Cox,  a former 737 pilot and ex-crash investigator for North America’s largest pilots union who now consults on safety for carriers and business aviation.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Boeing’s latest communications with airlines prompted American’s union to alert its members. “This is the first description you, as 737 pilots, have seen,” the union pointedly told pilots in a memo, referring to the 737 MAX stall-prevention system. Noting the system wasn’t mentioned in American Airlines’ or Boeing manuals, the union memo added: “It will be soon.”&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;The ultimate way to counteract dangerous automated nose-down commands is basically the same for old and new systems, though checklists and procedures for the 737 MAX 8 entail more steps and take more time. Investigators and safety experts are convinced that as the emergency worsened, the Lion Air crew had barely seconds in which they could have diagnosed the problem and taken action to save the aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Shortly before the plane crashed, according to local Indonesian media reports, one of the pilots told air-traffic controllers about difficulties controlling the plane.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Write to &lt;/strong&gt;Andy Pasztor at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:andy.pasztor@wsj.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon &quot;&gt;andy.pasztor@wsj.com&lt;/a&gt; and Andrew Tangel at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:Andrew.Tangel@wsj.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon &quot;&gt;Andrew.Tangel@wsj.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;/div&gt;



  &lt;/div&gt;

<title>The Dangerous Fetishization of ‘Hustle Porn’</title>
<link>https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/rise-grind-and-ruin-the-dangerous-fetishization-of-hustle-porn</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/rise-grind-and-ruin-the-dangerous-fetishization-of-hustle-porn</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a video I receive on WhatsApp every so often from relatives who want to help “get me out of my state of sleep” regarding my work life. On YouTube, it’s titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nShlloNgM2E&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;“The Greatest Speech Ever,”&lt;/a&gt; and it has more than two million views. Set to the sounds of a string orchestra, a voice tells me that “millennials spend too much time valuing themselves on Twitter” and “want everything… but so many of them, they don’t know how to hustle. They don’t know how to work on weekends.” The man in the video goes on to say that for anyone to “build an empire” they need to project positivity. “You want to be the guy that wants to build the biggest building in town, not tear down other people’s buildings,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;568&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nShlloNgM2E?feature=oembed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guy hoping to help me &lt;a href=&quot;https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/pulling-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps-is-actually-impossible&quot;&gt;pick myself up by my bootstraps&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/garyvee&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;Gary Vaynerchuk&lt;/a&gt;, an entrepreneur known for investing in tech companies like Facebook, Twitter and Venmo and amassing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wealthygorilla.com/gary-vaynerchuk-net-worth/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;$50 million&lt;/a&gt; fortune in the process. But it’s unlikely that you know him as a successful businessman. More likely, you’ll recognize him being plastered all over your social media feeds as an “inspirational speaker” and internet personality who gives lectures on how to hack your life in such a way that you become “more productive” and “more successful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Jay Shetty, a former management consultant who now calls himself an &lt;a href=&quot;https://jayshetty.me/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;“urban monk,”&lt;/a&gt; earns millions of views every month by making videos about waking up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLoDa3d6rCk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;before dawn&lt;/a&gt; to work long before your job actually starts, preaching the benefits of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9F5kMUfFKk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;speed reading&lt;/a&gt; seven books a week and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzn_QLV0a5Y&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;not sweating it if you haven’t gotten rich by your 30s or 40s&lt;/a&gt; because Mark Cuban and Richard Branson didn’t make their millions until then either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;568&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TLoDa3d6rCk?feature=oembed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These popular “inspirational” videos are monetizable offline too. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://startwithwhy.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;Simon Sinek&lt;/a&gt;, the motivational speaker notorious for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ygBXbTnNv0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;the viral “Millennials in the Workplace” video&lt;/a&gt;, in which he claimed that young people are unable to work in offices because they’re so used to earning &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ygBXbTnNv0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;“participation trophies&lt;/a&gt;,” got hired to be a “motivational consultant” for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ice.gov/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;ICE&lt;/a&gt; (yes, that ICE).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;568&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ygBXbTnNv0?feature=oembed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no surprise that such content has found popularity among the tech community, as so many of these inspirational gurus openly admire — and more or less copy — the style of tycoons like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptD0T-ZcF2M&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJp5Aur5uWs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sxpKhIbr0E&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;Scott Geller&lt;/a&gt;. After all, it was in Silicon Valley where “life-hacking” culture &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenewstack.io/dark-side-life-silicon-valley-hacker-house/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;took off&lt;/a&gt;, and companies attributed their success not just by profits but by how much their employees &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2016/04/what-makes-some-silicon-valley-companies-so-successful&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;personally cared about them&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, as a term, the concept of “life hacking” was coined at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://conferences.oreilly.com/etech&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;O’Reilly Emerging Technology Conference&lt;/a&gt; in San Diego back in 2004, mainly referring to the technical tricks and shortcuts computer programmers were employing to get more work done. Nowadays, though, there’s a “life hack” for everything, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3_f8HoLo5g&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;cleaning your teeth&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECxYJcnvyMw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;working out in seven minutes&lt;/a&gt; to turning &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSnIB_ab1LU&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;a box of Tic Tacs into a USB key holder.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;568&quot; height=&quot;426&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/WSnIB_ab1LU?feature=oembed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the most contemporary “life hacks” tend to be more associated with how individuals hack themselves — i.e., their own bodies — in order to enhance their job performance. But along with inspiration, this attempt at being as productive as humanly possible has also come under a fair amount of criticism. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grazia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grazia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, journalist &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/victoria_spratt?lang=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;Vicky Spratt&lt;/a&gt; argues that “hustle porn” is “making us miserable” and that social media has turned working into a “lifestyle brand,” which dismisses the generational decline of wealth and material production in the economy. “Our generation was told that we could be, that we could do anything, and we have entered the working world to find that it’s just not true yet. Things have improved but there are still huge obstacles to overcome and pursuing perfection along the way will only make that harder to do,” she writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spratt goes on to argue that hustle porn culture can often serve as a smokescreen for real, structural problems in the modern workplace. “No amount of grifting or endless working” will help alleviate the gender pay gap, which, according to the World Economic Forum, won’t close for another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/01/gender-pay-gap-217-years-to-close-world-economic-forum&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;200 years&lt;/a&gt;, or the fact that nearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/real-life/metoo-hasn-t-changed-the-day-to-day-reality-of-being-a-woman/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;a quarter of all women in the American workforce&lt;/a&gt; are afraid of reporting on-the-job sexual harassment. Furthermore, last year, the American Association for Cancer Research found that those working long, night-shift jobs were 19 percent more likely to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theweek.co.uk/97635/how-hustle-porn-puts-tech-workers-health-at-risk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;get some form of cancer&lt;/a&gt;, while Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor at Stanford Business School, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/workplace-killing-people-nobody-cares&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;says that work-stress-related deaths are among the top five causes of death in the U.S. today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian &lt;a href=&quot;http://uk.businessinsider.com/reddit-alexis-ohanian-hustle-porn-toxic-dangerous-thing-in-tech-2018-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;called bullshit&lt;/a&gt; on this culture, too. “Hustle Porn is one of the most toxic, dangerous things in tech right now. This idea that unless you are suffering, grinding working every hour of every day, you’re not working hard enough.” Ohanian, a product of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ycombinator.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;Y-Combinator&lt;/a&gt;, a California based start-up hub, argued that Silicon Valley has for too long encouraged its employees to work extremely long hours under the guise that it would lead to both a better product and them becoming better people. “It has deleterious effects not just on your business but on your well-being,” he added, referencing the death of his mother that occurred while he was building Reddit. “As entrepreneurs, we are all so busy ‘crushing it’ that physical health, let alone mental health, is an afterthought for most founders. It took me years to realize that the way I was feeling — when working on Reddit was the only therapy I had — was depression.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along those same lines, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@nateliason/no-more-struggle-porn-202153a01108&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;in a Medium post last month&lt;/a&gt;, Nat Eliason, founder of another startup hub, Growth Machine, wrote, “Struggle porn has normalized sustained failure. It’s made it acceptable to fly to Bali and burn through your life savings trying to launch an Amazon dropshipping business. Made it reasonable to keep living on your parents money for years after graduation while you try to become #instafamous. Made LinkedIn into a depressingly hilarious &lt;a href=&quot;https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/a-circular-history-of-circle-jerks&quot;&gt;circle jerk&lt;/a&gt; for people who look way too excited to be having their headshot taken.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliason adds that the most dangerous part of this culture is how it lauds the lack of progress as a sign of success, and in so doing, considers “quitting” weak and a sign of failure. “When you believe the normal state of affairs is to feel like you’re struggling to make progress, you’ll be less likely to quit something that isn’t going anywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All the hustle porn, work harder and be better shit, it basically ruined my life,” says Jamie King, a 30-year-old tech consultant in London. King explains that he was “a sucker for all the motivational stuff you see on YouTube, all the epic videos where guys play [American] football in the rain, or where they’re climbing mountains and stuff.” He turned to these videos after years of trying to figure out how to overcome procrastination, a problem he says has led to missed deadlines and jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For King, these videos were a quick way to stay on track, to push himself into thinking that “if there were guys that spent months losing weight by running up hills everyday without fail, I could push myself a couple of hours to finish a report or a project I was working on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the short-term, the strategy worked. But because the YouTube algorithm kept recommending more and more of these videos, they ended up severely impacting his sense of self-worth. “The more videos you watch, the more you end up feeling like you aren’t doing enough,” he explains. “For example, there were videos I watched that basically said that buying your lunch was a form of weakness, because more efficient people meal prepped beforehand. Or there was this short period of time last year when I tried to wake up at 4:30 a.m. every morning because there were all these videos saying that the most successful people do that so they can start their days before everyone else. I was able to wake up, but I ended up just being tired and miserable all day. There were months where I wouldn’t speak to anyone at work because I was just too tired to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, he says the thing the videos were best at were “warping reality.” Per King, “One of the reasons this kind of motivation culture works is because it’s targeted to guys like me, who feel like they just need to tweak a few things in their lives to make everything better. And so, you go and search for advice — I guess in the same way as if you were sick, you’d go online to get an idea of how to make things better so you don’t have to go to the hospital. But the more videos you watch, the more problems you think you have. Because you’re always told you aren’t good enough, that making mistakes is a problem with your personal character and you have to embody the kind of determined lifestyle that these motivation YouTubers have. But at the end of the day, when you realize their advice doesn’t help you in the long-term, you just end up feeling shit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-three-year-old Deeyah tells me over Twitter how a once close friend had fallen into the trap of watching hustle porn after she was laid off from a PR firm. “My friend had been spending a lot of time online, looking for jobs, but she was watching these videos as a way to cheer herself up.” After a month, Deeyah’s friend ended up joining what Deeyah calls “the most transparent pyramid scheme you could imagine — a company that was pushing energy drinks online. They called themselves an international corporation with a global distribution, and promised that their hires would be sales reps who would be ranked based on how much of the drink they sold, as well as their contributions to the company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t long before Deeyah’s friend tried to get Deeyah involved as well. “We had so many fights about it — like she was telling me that I’d lead a more fulfilling life if I joined the company, that it was the best work ethic, that work felt like family. It was all the things you’d expect from a pyramid scheme, but they kept people hooked by sending them motivational videos where the struggle of selling was the motivation. Like, there were sales guys in the videos saying, ‘The early bird catches the worm, but if you want to succeed, you need to be the first bird to wake up.’ She really bought into it, and it’s had a big impact on our friendship because you can see how obsessed she’s become by it all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s that kind of exploitation that, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Srnicek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;Nick Srnicek&lt;/a&gt;, a lecturer in the digital economy at King’s College in London and co-author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.versobooks.com/books/2315-inventing-the-future&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World Without Work&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is the real problem with contemporary work environments. While Srnicek says that hustle porn influencers can encourage damaging habits, they also promote the myth that “if you work sufficiently hard, you’ll be one of these major influencers and one of these top people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lots of this culture tends to be very performative too,” Srnicek continues. “Because lots of this culture is taken from the fitness world. What you find is that, like fitness people who want to show and talk about their gains and what they’ve been working on, you’ll have guys who want to show off their life hacking. You’ll have people who want to talk about how they wake up early in the morning to start work, or how they stayed in the office all night working. It’s almost as if they value themselves based on this performance, which makes sense, because if you think about it, in an industrial economy where people made things, they could say that they went to work and did something. Whereas in an office environment — and in a service-driven economy — that’s harder to determine. So some people end up thinking they have to do particular things that their colleagues don’t do to justify why they haven’t wasted their day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, though, like Spratt noted, this mostly points to a broken work system, one where motivational YouTubers or inspirational posts are only a symptom of a much larger problem. “We’re in an economy where, in theory there’s high employment, but also a record number of people who say they feel insecure in their jobs, or how long they’ll stay in them,” Srnicek says. “Until that issue around security and safety is addressed — and that’s a systemic change that requires political momentum — you’ll always have people wanting to find ways to differentiate themselves, and other people who will make money based off the claim that they know exactly how to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;

                    The pilots spotted fast flying objects and bright lights in the sky
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;The Irish Aviation Authority is investigating reports of bright lights and UFOs off the south-west coast of Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It began at 06:47 local time on Friday 9 November when a British Airways pilot contacted Shannon air traffic control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She wanted to know if there were military exercises in the area because there was something &quot;moving so fast&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The air traffic controller said there were no such exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pilot, flying from the Canadian city of Montreal to Heathrow, said there was a &quot;very bright light&quot; and the object had come up along the left side of the aircraft before it &quot;rapidly veered to the north&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was wondering what it could be but said it did not seem to be heading for a collision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another pilot from a Virgin plane joined in and suggested it might be a meteor or another object re-entering the earth's atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said there were &quot;multiple objects following the same sort of trajectory&quot; and that they were very bright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pilot said he saw &quot;two bright lights&quot; over to the right which climbed away at speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One pilot said the speed was &quot;astronomical, it was like Mach 2&quot; - which is twice the speed of sound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption body-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;What could it have been?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apostolos Christou, an astronomer from the Armagh Observatory and Planetarium, said what the pilots saw was probably a piece of dust entering the earth's atmosphere at very high speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was most likely what are commonly called shooting stars,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It appears the matter was extremely bright so it must have been quite a large piece of material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I cannot say from the pilots' description, but it could have been the size of a walnut or an apple.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The astronomer said November tended to be a very busy month for such activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It also appears there were bits coming off the object and flying past the aeroplane, that is also what you would expect if it was a particularly large rock from space hitting the atmosphere, it would tend to fragment.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption body-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Following reports from a small number of aircraft on Friday 9 November of unusual air activity the IAA has filed a report,&quot; the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This report will be investigated under the normal confidential occurrence investigation process.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Shannon Airport said it would not be appropriate for the airport to comment while the IAA investigation is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google, Facebook, and Amazon benefit from an outdated definition of “monopoly”</title>
<link>https://qz.com/work/1460402/google-facebook-and-amazon-benefit-from-an-outdated-definition-of-monopoly/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://qz.com/work/1460402/google-facebook-and-amazon-benefit-from-an-outdated-definition-of-monopoly/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 _7c929&quot;&gt;A few weeks ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nationalpost.com/news/world/italy-fines-apple-and-samsung-says-they-pushed-software-updates-on-customers-that-forced-them-to-buy-new-phones&quot;&gt;Italy fined Apple and Samsung&lt;/a&gt; €15 million for the “planned obsolescence” of their smartphones. The antitrust regulators allege that both companies pushed users to download software that slowed phone performance, forcing customers to buy replacement phones sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 _7c929&quot;&gt;The fines were another blow to big tech companies as the groundswell of skepticism against them rises. These companies have amassed so much power that even Apple CEO Tim Cook has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/tim-cook-says-techs-dark-side-is-real-1540387871-cffb003d-3593-49af-8a8b-f368d568a393.html&quot;&gt;called for stricter regulations to be placed on them&lt;/a&gt;. Google owns &lt;a href=&quot;http://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share&quot;&gt;92% market share&lt;/a&gt; of internet searches, Facebook an almost &lt;a href=&quot;http://gs.statcounter.com/social-media-stats&quot;&gt;70% share of social networks&lt;/a&gt;. Both have a duopoly in advertising with no credible competition or regulation. Amazon, meanwhile, is crushing retailers and faces conflicts of interest as both the dominant e-commerce seller and the leading online platform for third-party sellers. Apple’s iPhone and Google’s Android completely control the mobile app market, and they determine whether businesses can reach their customers and on what terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 _7c929&quot;&gt;So why hasn’t the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) taken action to break up these companies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 _7c929&quot;&gt;I believe that an outdated interpretation of antitrust law is partly to blame. For decades the standard for evaluating whether to break up monopolies, or block the mergers that create them, has been “consumer welfare.” And this consumer welfare standard has predominantly been interpreted as low prices. If companies can show that a merger or acquisition would not impact prices, for the most part, they win approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 _7c929&quot;&gt;But in the context of technology companies—which often offer “free” platforms and instead sell user attention as their product—this low-prices-focused paradigm makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_5e420 _7c929&quot;&gt;How “consumer welfare” came to be synonymous with “low prices”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 _7c929&quot;&gt;In 1912, Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson both ran for president on monopoly-busting platforms. After Wilson won, Congress passed two major antitrust laws. The first was the Clayton Antitrust Act, which sought to further reign in anticompetitive behavior by building on the legal precedent of the Sherman Act of 1890. The second was the creation of the FTC, an agency that was given the power to investigate violations of antitrust law and to issue orders forbidding unfair competition practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 _7c929&quot;&gt;A period of strict antitrust enforcement followed—as did the largest expansion of the US middle class in history–between 1940 and 1980.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 _7c929&quot;&gt;But in the 1980s, the interpretation of foundational antitrust laws began to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 _7c929&quot;&gt;The Chicago School, a group of economists led by Milton Freidman, advocated against state regulation of commerce under almost any circumstances. They argued that the one and only thing that should matter in antitrust cases is “consumer welfare,” and that the welfare of the consumer is only measured by low prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 _7c929&quot;&gt;For decades lawmakers had protected Americans as businessmen, entrepreneurs, and workers, but this new philosophy reduced people to mere consumers. The number of antitrust cases began to drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 _7c929&quot;&gt;Today, more than 90% of mergers close. This year &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/b7e67ba4-c28f-11e8-95b1-d36dfef1b89a&quot;&gt;set a new record&lt;/a&gt; for the value of global merger and acquisition activity—$3.3 trillion at the end of September. Both globally and in the US, this is greater than at any other time in history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_5e420 _7c929&quot;&gt;How tech titans benefit from monopoly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 _7c929&quot;&gt;Google, Facebook, and Amazon have great technology, but much of their current status and financial success comes from what I believe are regulatory and antitrust mistakes. Amazon was allowed to buy dozens of ecommerce rivals and online booksellers to give it a monopsony position in the book industry. Google was able to buy its main competitor, DoubleClick, and vertically integrate online ad markets by buying advertising exchanges. Facebook was able to buy Instagram and WhatsApp with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/regulators-ftc-facebook-google-doj-advertising-5ea0f001-eca8-4f07-b7d0-6ed22782800f.html&quot;&gt;no regulatory challenges&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 _7c929&quot;&gt;Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft have together acquired &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/americas-most-successful-companiesare-%20killing-the-economy-2017-05-24.&quot;&gt;more than 500 companies&lt;/a&gt; in the past decade. Many new tech startups never get the chance to compete with the established companies, because as soon as they prove their technologies, they are acquired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 _7c929&quot;&gt;But startups aren’t the only ones suffering. A growing mountain of evidence is showing that increasing industrial concentration via all the merger activity is leading to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/29/upshot/why-is-productivity-so-weak-three-theories.html&quot;&gt;lower productivity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://rooseveltinstitute.org/new-study-labor-market-concentration/&quot;&gt;lower wages&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thirdway.org/report/a-less-dynamic-american-economy-whats-going-on&quot;&gt;destroyed economic dynamism&lt;/a&gt;. And despite the fetish for lower prices, &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2612047&quot;&gt;highly concentrated industries have been &lt;em&gt;raising&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; prices on their consumers. This is why you keep paying more for worse service on airlines, as an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_5e420 _7c929&quot;&gt;The way forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 _7c929&quot;&gt;To put it in tech terms: Our antitrust laws are like good hardware that is malfunctioning. The merger guidelines and case law—influenced by the Chicago School and predicated on consumer welfare—has become like failing “software.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 _7c929&quot;&gt;Our antitrust hardware and software are both in great need of updating to deal with the incredible amassed power of today’s tech firms. The consumer welfare standard that has been adopted for antitrust enforcement is completely ineffectual in dealing with our current realities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 _7c929&quot;&gt;It’s time to move our consumer welfare standard to the trash and reboot.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Improving DuckDuckGo</title>
<link>https://duck.co/help/privacy/atb</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://duck.co/help/privacy/atb</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;At DuckDuckGo, we do not collect or share any personal information. That's our &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/privacy&quot;&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; in a nutshell. For example, we do not store IP addresses, and we do not create unique cookies. As such, we do not even have the ability to create search histories or search sessions for any individual — privacy by design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we need a way to reliably improve our products for our users in an anonymous way. There are a few methods we've developed to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you might notice that when you search DuckDuckGo, there may be an &quot;&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;atb=&lt;/code&gt;&quot; URL parameter in the web address at the top of your browser. This parameter allows us to anonymously A/B (split) test product changes we make to DuckDuckGo. For example, users in the A group would get blue links and users in the B group would get red links, and we'd be able to measure how usage of DuckDuckGo is impacted by different color links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we measure engagement of specific events on the page (e.g. when a misspelling message is displayed, and when it is clicked). This allows us to run experiments where we can test different misspelling messages and use CTR (click through rate) to determine the message's efficacy. If you are looking at network requests, these are the ones going to the one-pixel image at &lt;code&gt;improving.duckduckgo.com&lt;/code&gt;. These requests are anonymous and the information is used only by us to improve our products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, you may notice similar &quot;&lt;code&gt;atb.js&lt;/code&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;code&gt;exti&lt;/code&gt;&quot; requests made by our browser extensions and mobile apps. These requests help us anonymously count how many devices are using an experience. For example, our browser extensions and mobile apps will only send one type of these requests a day, which means we can count approximately how many devices accessed DuckDuckGo without knowing anything about those devices or the searches they made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these requests are all fully encrypted in transit to DuckDuckGo, such that nobody else but us can see them. And like with all other requests to DuckDuckGo, there is no personally identifiable information embedded in them, and we do not store IP addresses associated with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, this means &lt;strong&gt;we cannot ever tell what individual people are doing since everyone is anonymous&lt;/strong&gt;, and that is a limit of our statistical methods since we are private by design. We can, however, within this anonymous limitation, reliably determine what changes are generally working, using these anonymous methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have developed these systems from scratch, instead of using third-party services, because of our privacy promise to never collect or share any personal information. We're proud to be able to improve our site for you in a completely anonymous way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any concerns, please feel free to reach out to us directly at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:privacy@duckduckgo.com&quot;&gt;privacy@duckduckgo.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update Nov-13-2018: The two &quot;how-to&quot; posts &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/07/27/first-bookdown-contest/&quot;&gt;won the first place&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;1st Bookdown Contest&lt;/em&gt; by RStudio&lt;/em&gt; 😃&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine told me to write down all the details about self-publishing a book.&lt;br/&gt;So here you go—a long post explaining almost all the things I have done and discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, my thanks go to Bookdown. This R package allows enthusiastic people to self-publish a book! Although the book is based on R language, this process can be applied to any kind of book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaylen Sanders from OpenDataScience.com did a poetic &lt;a href=&quot;https://opendatascience.com/the-open-source-project-data-science-live-book-is-now-available&quot;&gt;review of it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;theend&quot;&gt;The end&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two-year journey culminated with two paperback versions available on Amazon (Color and B&amp;amp;W), a Kindle version, an epub version, a PDF, and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://livebook.datascienceheroes.com&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/datascienceheroes.com/img/blog/dslb_2.gif&quot; title=&quot;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1&quot; alt=&quot;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;thestart&quot;&gt;The start&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't plan to write a book. Around six years ago, I started using R and, as with many programmers, my &quot;personal&quot; library with many shortcuts began to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I thought that this library could help more people, so after arranging lots of things in the right place, I published the 'funModeling' package on CRAN in February 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google and the book &lt;a href=&quot;http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/&quot;&gt;R Packages&lt;/a&gt; from Hadley Wickham (April 2015) were incredibly useful. Don't hesitate to check out that book if you plan to write a package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/datascienceheroes.com/img/blog/01_r_packages.png&quot; title=&quot;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2&quot; alt=&quot;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2&quot; width=&quot;250px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I deeply believe that when there is an explanation behind what we use and what we do, it changes the way we perceive the action. So, I started to document the funModeling package functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentation grew rapidly, and soon escaped from the original scope of the package to include general explanations of machine learning and data preparation, and then the first version of the book was born!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two months after the release, I rewrote everything from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two &lt;strong&gt;key points&lt;/strong&gt; here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We don’t always we have a clear goal—we just &quot;walk&quot; and that goal takes shape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first version is not always the ultimate one; start now with the ideas you already have and let them grow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;writingstyle&quot;&gt;Writing style&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to &quot;write everything I know&quot;—things that took me a lot of time to learn—and expose the concepts with examples, lots of examples, so the reader can check them and extract their own conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other remarkable point was on 'how to interpret all the results.” I found that when someone explains the analytical thinking path, extracting different conclusions from the analysis; then the undersanding around the topic is boosted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two books are aligned with the last idea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/datascienceheroes.com/img/blog/02_dm_jiawei.png&quot; title=&quot;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3&quot; alt=&quot;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3&quot; width=&quot;250px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques 3rd Edition&lt;/em&gt; by Jiawei Han, Micheline Kamber and Jian Pei (2012)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/datascienceheroes.com/img/blog/03_dm_torgo.png&quot; title=&quot;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4&quot; alt=&quot;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4&quot; width=&quot;250px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data Mining with R: Learning with Case Studies&lt;/em&gt; by Luís Torgo (2011)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Data Science = Data Mining + some marketing ;) Nowadays: Data Mining = web scraping&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;didiuseanyeditor&quot;&gt;Did I use any editor?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope, you can 100% self-publish a book on your own, with patience and the Amazon self-publishing service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Editors can help in the book structure, proofreading, marketing, printing, and distribution among others. It saves time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;marketing&quot;&gt;Marketing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine surprised me with a Facebook ad campaign for the book when I launched it. Except from that, all marketing was done by word-of-mouth and some posts in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.datascienceheroes.com/&quot;&gt;Data Science Heroes Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you share it? ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;howtocreatethebookbookdown&quot;&gt;How to create the book: Bookdown!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This amazing R package provides all the processes to create Kindle and paperback editions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get started with the minimum reproducible example at&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown&quot;&gt;https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/datascienceheroes.com/img/blog/05_bookdown_cover.png&quot; title=&quot;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5&quot; alt=&quot;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5&quot; width=&quot;250px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Data Science Live Book&lt;/em&gt; was 100% done using R and RStudio.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only Bookdown should be a BIG point in any &lt;em&gt;&quot;Why R?&quot;&lt;/em&gt; list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should google all of these terms before starting: Latex, Yaml, Knitr, R markdown, Pandoc, GitBook. None of them are Pokémon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check the RStudio lessons on what is R Markdown: &lt;a href=&quot;https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html&quot;&gt;https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.datascienceheroes.com/content/images/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-25-at-19.13.40.png&quot; alt=&quot;R markdown workflow&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;selfpublishingonamazon&quot;&gt;Self-publishing on Amazon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/datascienceheroes.com/img/blog/06_amazon.png&quot; title=&quot;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6&quot; alt=&quot;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6&quot; width=&quot;150px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon runs a program called &lt;a href=&quot;https://kdp.amazon.com/&quot;&gt;Kindle Direct Publishing&lt;/a&gt; (KDP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;publishingthepaperbackversion&quot;&gt;Publishing the paperback version&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You upload the PDF and Amazon will &lt;strong&gt;print on demand&lt;/strong&gt;. That's it. You don't have to invest any money to buy so many copies before the release. After you publish, if one person from the Antartida buys a copy, then it is printed and delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other print-on-demand publishers, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lulu.com/&quot;&gt;lulu.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose to have both versions: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/9874269049&quot;&gt;Black &amp;amp; White&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/9874273666&quot;&gt;Color&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality is excellent in both, but the color one is stunning! I see how colors help us to understand. However, the printing costs are around four times higher for this version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon will check several layout points before approving the release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check the color version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/datascienceheroes.com/img/blog/07_dslb.png&quot; title=&quot;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-7&quot; alt=&quot;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-7&quot; width=&quot;700px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;And one from the black and white:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/datascienceheroes.com/img/blog/08_dslb.png&quot; title=&quot;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-8&quot; alt=&quot;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-8&quot; width=&quot;700px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note the quality of the plots and code layout —pretty important in a programming book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;publishingthekindleversion&quot;&gt;Publishing the Kindle version&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easier to publish than the paperback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kindle version of the Data Science Live Book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/9874273666&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Amazon is incredibly vast, from printing-publishing books to host deep learning processes in AWS. Someday, Amazon and Google will be countries.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You won't become rich publishing books unless you have a catchy title, like &quot;Fifty Shades of Data in Grey.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;costsandearnings&quot;&gt;Costs and earnings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;kindle&quot;&gt;Kindle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two royalty options: 35% or 70%. We always want the higher, right? Well, in the 70% range, the book price must be US$9.99 at the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More info: &lt;a href=&quot;https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G200634560&quot;&gt;https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G200634560&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;paperback&quot;&gt;Paperback&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Printing costs depend on &lt;strong&gt;several factors&lt;/strong&gt;. On this page, you will find how costs/royalties are calculated as well as a &quot;Printing cost calculator&quot; excel file: &lt;a href=&quot;https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G201834340&quot;&gt;https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G201834340&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/datascienceheroes.com/img/blog/09_earnings.png&quot; title=&quot;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-9&quot; alt=&quot;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-9&quot; width=&quot;680px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon royalties are around 40% of retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, royalties when using a publisher are around 8–12% of the retail price. Source &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alanjacobson.com/writers-toolkit/the-business-of-publishing/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a publisher/editor may facilitate several of things, so don't opt out only because of the earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;publishingoutsideamazongumroad&quot;&gt;Publishing outside Amazon: Gumroad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gumroad.com&quot;&gt;Gumroad&lt;/a&gt; is a service that allows users to sell different types of files across the internet, e.g., music, videos, and data science books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/datascienceheroes.com/img/blog/10_gumroad.png&quot; title=&quot;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-10&quot; alt=&quot;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-10&quot; width=&quot;250px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gumroad provides a shopping cart and, after payment, the buyer automatically receives an email with the download link. It works really well! No one complains about the service. The pricing is affordable: &lt;em&gt;&quot;If you use the Free version of Gumroad, our fee is just 8.5% + 30 cents per transaction. If you get the Premium version of Gumroad for $10 (USD)/month, our fee is 3.5% + 30 cents per sale.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with the free version and then changed to premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most useful features is that they allow embedding the payment form into your website. You can check mine &lt;a href=&quot;https://livebook.datascienceheroes.com/download-book.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other useful feature is name your price. The minimum price to download the &lt;em&gt;Data Science Live Book&lt;/em&gt; is US$5 and the buyer gets all three versions: PDF, .mobi, and .epub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was writing this post, I saw that 37% of buyers spent more than the minimum—&lt;strong&gt;I'm happy&lt;/strong&gt; you like the project!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a list of unique buyers’ countries that bought using Gumroad—so it works worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/datascienceheroes.com/img/blog/11_countries.png&quot; title=&quot;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-11&quot; alt=&quot;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-11&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you find the outlier? :P&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;proofreading&quot;&gt;Proofreading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try always to share the book before its release.&lt;br/&gt;Proofreading is needed at two levels: &lt;strong&gt;technical and grammatical&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the technical aspects, the proofreading was mainly done by Pablo Seibelt, Head of Data in Auth0. I have also made some changes based on people’s feedback. (Thanks!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the grammar check, I hired several English teachers, to finally keep with one outstanding freelancer, Dr. Candy Pettus, from www.fiverr.com (a site to hire freelancers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/datascienceheroes.com/img/blog/12_gramarly.png&quot; title=&quot;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-12&quot; alt=&quot;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-12&quot; width=&quot;200px&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/datascienceheroes.com/img/blog/13_deepl.png&quot; title=&quot;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-13&quot; alt=&quot;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-13&quot; width=&quot;200px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because my native language is Spanish (Hola!), I also use tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.grammarly.com/&quot;&gt;Grammarly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deepl.com&quot;&gt;DeepL&lt;/a&gt; (which works better than Google Translate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;cover&quot;&gt;Cover&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tree was generated by an iterative and short algorithm.&lt;br/&gt;Representing that simplicity is the seed of complexity.&lt;br/&gt;Like fractals.&lt;br/&gt;Like the Lorenz Attractor.&lt;br/&gt;And like nature itself...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the designer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/barbaramercedes/&quot;&gt;Barbara Muños&lt;/a&gt;, took the little tree and made the magic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/datascienceheroes.com/img/blog/14_cover_dslb.png&quot; title=&quot;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-14&quot; alt=&quot;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-14&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, yes, the curve on the top follows the Fibonacci ratio, a feature present in flowers, art, the human body, and &quot;a big etc.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of cover designers on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fiverr.com/&quot;&gt;fiverr.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;isbn&quot;&gt;ISBN&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Standard Book Number (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number&quot;&gt;ISBN&lt;/a&gt;) is a unique numeric commercial book identifier. Publishers purchase an ISBN from an affiliate of the International ISBN Agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will need an ISBN for each book version&lt;/strong&gt;. In my case, I bought three: one for each of the Kindle, B&amp;amp;W, and color versions. Note: the content is the same in all three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon can provide you with a &quot;free&quot; ISBN if you sell the book only with them. If you want to sell in other markets, then you will have to get outside of Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;imprint&quot;&gt;Imprint&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;An imprint of a publisher is a trade name under which it publishes a work&quot; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprint_(trade_name)&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imprint is defined when you register your ISBN. Being a self-publisher means that you can pick your imprint name (it can be your real name or a fictitious one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you self-publish and you bought an ISBN outside the US, then you have to let &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bowker.com/&quot;&gt;bowker.com&lt;/a&gt; know that you effectively own the ISBN you are uploading. Contact them by email for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I'm not an expert on the ISBN or imprint name, therefore, what applies in my case may not in yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;linkingbwcolorandkindleonamazon&quot;&gt;Linking: B&amp;amp;W, color and Kindle on Amazon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are selling these three versions, you might except to have all of them linked. You will need to contact Amazon support to do this, because they only support one paperback linked to a kindle. Yet, the final result si some annoying...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.datascienceheroes.com/content/images/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-25-at-14.25.45.png&quot; alt=&quot;linking different versions on Amazon&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;em&gt;&quot;Paperback&quot;&lt;/em&gt; links to B&amp;amp;W version and &lt;em&gt;&quot;Paperback, March 27, 2018&quot;&lt;/em&gt; links to color version (🧟‍♂️).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask for adding the legend &quot;Color&quot; and &quot;B&amp;amp;W&quot; at the end of each title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;howtowritegood&quot;&gt;How to write good&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prepared a list of issues and Bookdown configurations to keep in mind that took me lot of time to find. Hopefully, it will save you time: &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.datascienceheroes.com/how-to-self-publish-a-book-customizing-bookdown/&quot;&gt;https://blog.datascienceheroes.com/how-to-self-publish-a-book-customizing-bookdown/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;finalwords&quot;&gt;Final words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to self-publish a book? Yes, definitely!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this post useful on this topic: &lt;a href=&quot;https://msperlin.github.io/2017-02-16-Writing-a-book/&quot;&gt;Writing an R book and self-publishing it in Amazon&lt;/a&gt; by Marcelo Perlin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will leave you with the back of the &lt;em&gt;Data Science Live Book&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Learning to Read in Your 30s Profoundly Transforms the Brain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The learning process leads to a reorganization that extends to deep brain structures.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;By Max Planck Institute for Human Cognition and Brain Sciences and Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;social&quot;&gt;   &lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;article readability=&quot;78.942939689419&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;eading is such a new ability in human evolutionary history that the existence of a “reading area” could not be specified in our genes. A kind of recycling process has to take place in the brain while learning to read: Areas evolved for the recognition of complex objects, such as faces, become engaged in translating letters into language. Some regions of our visual system thereby turn into interfaces between the visual and language systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Until now it was assumed that these changes are limited to the outer layer of the brain, the cortex, which is known to adapt quickly to new challenges,” says project leader Falk Huettig from the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics. The Max Planck researchers together with Indian scientists from the Centre of Bio-Medical Research (CBMR) Lucknow and the University of Hyderabad have now discovered what changes occur in the adult brain when completely illiterate people learn to read and write. In contrast to previous assumptions, the learning process leads to a reorganization that extends to deep brain structures in the thalamus and the brainstem. The relatively young phenomenon of human writing, therefore, changes brain regions that are very old in evolutionary terms and already core parts of mice and other mammalian brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/maxplanck_0621757c44fcadcf23f202d615e56352.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;brain_breaker&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;When becoming literate neuroplasticity conquers a network that is deeply rooted in the brain. This reorganization makes us more and more efficient in visually navigating through letter strings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;© Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive Brain Sciences&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We observed that the so-called colliculi superiores, a part of the brainstem, and the pulvinar, located in the thalamus, adapt the timing of their activity patterns to those of the visual cortex,” says Michael Skeide, scientific researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences (MPI CBS) in Leipzig and first author of the study, which has been published in the renowned magazine &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;. “These deep structures in the thalamus and brainstem help our visual cortex to filter important information from the flood of visual input even before we consciously perceive it.” Interestingly, it seems that the more the signal timings between the two brain regions are aligned, the better the reading capabilities. “We, therefore, believe that these brain systems increasingly fine-tune their communication as learners become more and more proficient in reading,” the neuroscientist explains further. “This could explain why experienced readers navigate more efficiently through a text.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large-scale study with illiterates in India&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interdisciplinary research team obtained these findings in India, a country with an illiteracy rate of about 39 percent. Poverty still limits access to education in some parts of India, especially for women. Therefore, in this study, nearly all participants were women in their 30s. At the beginning of the training, the majority of them could not decipher a single written word of their mother tongue Hindi. Hindi, one of the official languages of India, is based on Devanagari, a scripture with complex characters describing whole syllables or words rather than single letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants reached a level comparable to a first-grader after only six months of reading training. “This growth of knowledge is remarkable,” says project leader Huettig. “While it is quite difficult for us to learn a new language, it appears to be much easier for us to learn to read. The adult brain proves to be astonishingly flexible.” In principle, this study could also have taken place in Europe. Yet illiteracy is regarded as such a taboo in the West that it would have been immensely difficult to find volunteers to take part. Nevertheless, even in India where the ability to read and write is strongly connected to social class, the project was a tremendous challenge. The scientists recruited volunteers from the same social class in two villages in Northern India to make sure that social factors could not influence the findings. Brain scans were performed in the city of Lucknow, a three hours taxi ride away from participants’ homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new view on dyslexia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impressive learning achievements of the volunteers do not only provide hope for adult illiterates, they also shed new light on the possible cause of reading disorders such as dyslexia. One possible cause for the basic deficits observed in people with dyslexia has previously been attributed to dysfunctions of the thalamus. “Since we found out that only a few months of reading training can modify the thalamus fundamentally, we have to scrutinize this hypothesis,” neuroscientist Skeide explains. It could also be that affected people show different brain activity in the thalamus just because their visual system is less well trained than that of experienced readers. This means that these abnormalities can only be considered an innate cause of dyslexia if they show up prior to schooling. “That’s why only studies that assess children before they start to learn to read and follow them up for several years can bring clarity about the origins of reading disorders,” Huettig adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CLOUD WARS -- Microsoft’s booming $8.5-billion in cloud revenue last quarter has helped it open a decisive lead over Amazon as the world’s leading enterprise cloud provider for the past 12 months, $26.7 billion to $23.4$ billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Amazon’s AWS cloud unit put up &lt;a href=&quot;https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazoncom-announces-third-quarter-sales-29-566-billion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazoncom-announces-third-quarter-sales-29-566-billion&quot;&gt;another set of great numbers for the quarter&lt;/a&gt; ended Sept. 30—$6.68 billion in revenue, up 46%—Microsoft’s fiscal first quarter was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobevans1/2018/07/26/why-amazon-cant-match-microsoft-in-the-cloud-10-insights-from-satya-nadella/#5dc8e5d41fb8&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobevans1/2018/07/26/why-amazon-cant-match-microsoft-in-the-cloud-10-insights-from-satya-nadella/#5dc8e5d41fb8&quot;&gt;simply better and reflected its continued strength across every facet&lt;/a&gt; of the white-hot enterprise-cloud market, with commercial-cloud revenue at 47%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some highlights for the 3 months ended Sept. 30:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Azure revenue up 76%;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamics 365 up 51% in the SaaS layer;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamics 365 revenue expected to hit $1.25 billion for the fiscal year (ending June 30, 2019); and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LinkedIn revenue up 33% to about $1.5 billion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his prepared remarks on Microsoft’s earnings call last week, CEO Satya Nadella offered this perspective on &lt;a href=&quot;https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://c.s-microsoft.com/en-us/CMSFiles/TranscriptFY19Q1.docx?version=9eceeee6-b256-e063-a6a9-9788251db79e&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://c.s-microsoft.com/en-us/CMSFiles/TranscriptFY19Q1.docx?version=9eceeee6-b256-e063-a6a9-9788251db79e&quot;&gt;the centerpiece of the Microsoft cloud: “Azure&lt;/a&gt; is the only hyperscale cloud that extends to the edge across identity, data, application platform and security and management. We introduced 100 new Azure capabilities this quarter alone, focused on both existing workloads like security and new workloads like IoT and Edge AI.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For AWS, some analysts and media outlets made a big to-do about the fact that the rate of growth for Amazon’s cloud business took a tiny downward turn for the quarter, slipping from 49% to 46%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that’s an overblown detail—if you look at the last several quarters, AWS has consistently achieved the remarkable feat of having its growth rate increase even as it has approached an annualized run rate of $25 billion. Starting with Q4 of 2016, the revenue-growth rate for AWS has been 42%, 42%, 44%, 48%, 49% and most recently 46%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very same minor decline in rate of growth occurred at Microsoft as well—its commercial-cloud revenue for the period ending June 30 was 53%, and then for the 3 months ending Sept. 30, that slipped to 47%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty much inevitable that as the cloud businesses of Microsoft and Amazon reach this type of scale--$26.7 billion in revenue for the past 12 months for Microsoft, and $23.4 billion for Amazon—growth rates will eventually decline. But if somebody’s got a problem with 47% growth for $25-billion businesses, then I’d say that person doesn’t have a clue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For IBM, its cloud business was one of the few bright spots in a largely challenging quarter as it posted $19 billion in cloud revenue for the 12 months ending Sept. 30, with the “as a service” portion of the IBM Cloud racking up $11.4 billion in revenue, up 24%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yesterday, IBM took a huge step to scale its cloud business by agreeing to acquire Red Hat for $34 billion, an acquisition that would add about $3 billion to IBM’s annual cloud revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Microsoft and Amazon, the competition over the next year will center on more than advanced cloud and AI technology as Microsoft continues to hammer on Amazon’s aggressive corporate strategy of jumping into an expanding array of industries and pitting itself as a direct competitor of businesses that might otherwise be viable prospects for AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Nadella said in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://c.s-microsoft.com/en-us/CMSFiles/TranscriptFY19Q1.docx?version=9eceeee6-b256-e063-a6a9-9788251db79e&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://c.s-microsoft.com/en-us/CMSFiles/TranscriptFY19Q1.docx?version=9eceeee6-b256-e063-a6a9-9788251db79e&quot;&gt;opening remarks on the earnings call&lt;/a&gt;, “Our cloud platforms and tools enable our customers to build tech intensity while ensuring we are addressing their tough questions around trust – both trust in technology and trust that they have a partner whose business model is aligned to their success.

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://xkcd.com/1185/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent xkcd's&lt;/a&gt; alt text, Randall Munroe suggested &lt;strong&gt;stacksort&lt;/strong&gt;, a sort that searches StackOverflow for sorting functions and runs them until it returns the correct answer. So, I made it. If you like running arbitrary code in your browser, try it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5395463&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;hn&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like (or hate) it?&lt;/strong&gt; Comment on HackerNews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;);&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;button id=&quot;sort&quot;&gt;Sort&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;label&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;var output =&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Output from the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;input&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;textarea&quot;&gt;
&lt;textarea id=&quot;output&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorted using answer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;questions&quot; readability=&quot;16.085829959514&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;question q1&quot; readability=&quot;20.922590837283&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does it work?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As outlined by &lt;a href=&quot;http://xkcd.com/1185/&quot;&gt;xkcd's recent alt text&lt;/a&gt;, this site downloads the top answers from StackOverflow for the tags &quot;javascript&quot; and &quot;sort&quot;. It grabs the last code block in the answer (in theory, the &quot;final&quot; example), and tries to determine which function should be called. It proceeds to &lt;em&gt;eval&lt;/em&gt; the code from StackOverflow, with the inputted data as the first parameter for the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If it returns a wrongly-sorted list&lt;/strong&gt; (or you just want to keep playing), a link to &quot;Try the next answer&quot; will appear under the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can view the code &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/gkoberger/stacksort&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. If you see any bugs (or just want to berate me), please file an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;question q2&quot; readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it safe?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh… it evals both user input &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; random code, unchecked, from an external site. This is what security-minded folks would refer to as Very Bad™.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, for what it is, it should be relatively harmless. The site will only fetch accepted answers, and it only uses answers that were posted before the xkcd was released (meaning that if someone posted malicious code now, it wouldn't matter). It also searches for potentially-malicious code (like the word &quot;cookie&quot;), and skips those. It's definitely not the safest thing, however at most it would probably just crash your browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;about&quot;&gt;Shamefully created by &lt;a href=&quot;http://gkoberger.net&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gregory Koberger&lt;/a&gt;.

<title>Apple’s Social Network</title>
<link>https://stratechery.com/2018/apples-social-network/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://stratechery.com/2018/apples-social-network/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;While the saying goes that “No news is good news,” in the case of Apple it turns out that “News about no news is bad news.” From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-02/apple-silence-on-iphone-unit-sales-sparks-concern-shows-future&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. shares had their worst day since 2014 amid concerns that growth in its powerhouse product, the iPhone, is slowing. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Apple said iPhone unit sales barely grew from a year earlier, even though new flagship devices came out in the period. At the same time, Apple said it would stop providing unit sales for iPhones, iPads, and Macs in fiscal 2019, a step toward becoming more of a services business. While some pundits praised the move as a way to highlight a potent new business model, many analysts complained it was an attempt to hide the pain of a stagnant smartphone market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has long been an exception in the smartphone space when it comes to reporting unit sales, so deciding not to is not that out of the ordinary; Apple, though, has always positioned itself as the extraordinary alternative — &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2014/best/&quot;&gt;the best&lt;/a&gt; — and that approach paid off for years with sales numbers that were worth bragging about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A History of iPhone Unit and Revenue Growth&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality, though, is that unit sales in isolation have indeed misrepresented Apple’s business for the last several years; specifically, they have underestimated it. Consider the last six years of iPhone revenue growth and unit growth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-5.43.32-AM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-5.43.32-AM-1024x511.png&quot; alt=&quot;iPhone unit growth and revenue growth over time&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;319&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-3793&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-5.43.32-AM-1024x511.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-5.43.32-AM-300x150.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-5.43.32-AM-768x383.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-5.43.32-AM-1200x599.png 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iPhone unit growth and revenue were obviously highly correlated in the early years of the iPhone, when the only price difference in the line concerned the amount of storage on the flagship device. As Apple started keeping older models in the lineup, though, revenue growth was a bit slower than unit growth due to a slowly declining average selling price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the iPhone 6 happened: not only was the “big-screen iPhone” stupendously popular — and, it should be noted, was the first phone sold at launch on all of China’s mobile carriers — it also, for the first time, included a configuration — the $749 iPhone 6 Plus — that had a higher base price than the iPhone’s traditional $649. The result was revenue growth that, for the first time, significantly outpaced unit growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iPhone 6S was the opposite story: while Apple thought that iPhone 6 sales figures represented the new normal, in reality Apple had pulled forward a huge number of flagship phone buyers. Ultimately the company had to take a $2 billion inventory write-off on the iPhone 6S after over-forecasting sales; meanwhile, older model phones (including the iPhone 6) were still selling well, so again unit growth outpaced revenue growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out, though, that the 6S was the new normal: iPhone unit sales have been basically flat ever since:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-5.44.14-AM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-5.44.14-AM-1024x509.png&quot; alt=&quot;iPhone unit sales over time&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;318&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-3792&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-5.44.14-AM-1024x509.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-5.44.14-AM-300x149.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-5.44.14-AM-768x382.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-5.44.14-AM-1200x597.png 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has changed is Apple’s pricing: the iPhone 7 Plus cost $20 more than the iPhone 6S Plus. Then, last year, came the big jump: both the iPhones 8 and 8 Plus cost more than their predecessors ($50 and $30 respectively); more importantly, they were no longer the flagship. That appellation belonged to the $999 iPhone X, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/the-iphone-franchise/&quot;&gt;given how many Apple fans will only buy the best&lt;/a&gt;, average selling price skyrocketed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-6.02.33-AM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-6.02.33-AM-1024x518.png&quot; alt=&quot;iPhone average selling price over time&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;324&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-3794&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-6.02.33-AM-1024x518.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-6.02.33-AM-300x152.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-6.02.33-AM-768x389.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-6.02.33-AM-1200x607.png 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, even though unit growth had been stagnant for a full three years (not just the last year, as many reports, including the one above, incorrectly stated), reporting those numbers helped Apple tell its story: after all, you needed unit numbers to calculate the average selling price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the reports are right about, though, is that unit sales going forward are absolutely a story Apple would prefer to avoid: it is very unlikely that units will grow, and while Apple pushed pricing even higher with the iPhone XS Max, it probably can’t go much further, which means it is likely that the average selling price-based revenue growth story is drawing to an end as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Today at Apple&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this point I have focused on the iPhone, and for good reason: last quarter it made up 59% of Apple’s revenue; for the company’s holiday quarter it will likely approach 70%. However, the company will also stop reporting unit sales for Macs and iPads. This came on the heels of a product announcement last week where Apple introduced a new MacBook Air, Mac Mini, and iPads Pro; all were priced significantly higher than their predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a surprise: the Mac line has been increasing in price for years, while the iPads Pro are balanced by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-9-7&quot;&gt;a strong entry-level product&lt;/a&gt; that starts at $329. The reality of both the Mac and iPads Pro are that they are niche products, and niche customers are willing to pay higher prices for products that better meet their needs.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/apples-social-network/#footnote_0_3790&quot; id=&quot;identifier_0_3790&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot; title=&quot;Well, theoretically anyways, in the case of the MacBook Pro&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was more interesting about last week’s event though, and which casts more light on Apple’s new growth story than the products announced, were the ten minutes in the middle devoted to Apple Retail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how Apple CEO Tim Cook introduced the segment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there are ways that Apple aims to inspire creativity in our users, including in our stores. The mission of our stores has always been to enrich the lives of our customers by educating and inspiring them to go even further. One of the new ways that we’re taking their creativity even further is through our Today at Apple sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today at Apple&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/04/today-at-apple-bringing-new-experiences-to-every-apple-store/&quot;&gt;announced with a press release&lt;/a&gt; in April, 2017, and received its first on-stage mention during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/P_JY6tl4KyY?t=589&quot;&gt;iPhone X keynote&lt;/a&gt;. Last week’s presentation, though, really highlighted how &lt;em&gt;Today at Apple&lt;/em&gt; is perhaps the best way to understand the way Apple thinks about its growth opportunities going forward. Senior Vice President of Retail Angela Ahrendts explained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started with the things that are core to Apple’s DNA, things people most use their devices for and trust us to teach them, like photography, music, gaming, and app development. And as Apple continues to develop curriculum like Everyone can Code and Everyone can Create, we embed these lessons and techniques into our &lt;em&gt;Today at Apple&lt;/em&gt; programming for all customers, including educators and entrepreneurs. And we hold all of our sessions in all 505 retail locations, like at Apple Cotai Central in Macau, which opened a few months ago. Here, customers are attending a session called Photo Walks, where they learn new features, like portrait lighting and depth control, while exploring the city together in a real social way…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as we continue to push the design of our flagships to be even greater gathering places where everyone is welcome, we’re also creating global platforms for local talent. Photographers, musicians, developers, and artists share their creative gifts…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the launch of Today at Apple, only 18 months ago, we have held over 18,000 sessions a week, attended by millions of curious creatives around the world. And with the newest release of the Apple Store app, we’ve made it even easier for you to find out what’s happening near you. Just tap on the Sessions tab and you’ll see a spotlight of the newest Today at Apple sessions in your city. It will also recommend sessions based on the products that you own, and signature programs like Music Labs, Kids Hour, and Photo Walks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is striking about &lt;em&gt;Today at Apple&lt;/em&gt; is the scale of its ambition combined with its price: free. Of course that is not true in practice, because one needs an Apple device to realistically participate (and an Apple ID to even sign up), but that raises the question as to what Apple customers are paying for when they buy an Apple product? Apple’s point in highlighting &lt;em&gt;Today at Apple&lt;/em&gt; is that customer’s are not simply buying an iPhone or an iPad or a Mac, but rather buying into an ongoing relationship with Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Apple’s Social Network&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More broadly, this explains CFO Luca Maestri reasoning &lt;a href=&quot;https://seekingalpha.com/article/4217359-apple-aapl-q4-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single&quot;&gt;on the earnings call&lt;/a&gt; for no longer reporting unit sales:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, starting with the December quarter, we will no longer be providing unit sales data for iPhone, iPad and Mac. As we have stated many times, our objective is to make great products and services that enrich people’s lives, and to provide an unparalleled customer experience so that our users are highly satisfied, loyal and engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Engaged” is an interesting choice of words, as engagement is an objective normally associated with social networks like Facebook. The reasoning is obvious: the more engaged users are, the more they use a social network, which means the more ads they can be shown. Social networks accomplish this by aggregating content from suppliers as well as users themselves, and continually tweaking algorithms in an attempt to keep you swiping and tapping, and coming back to swipe and tap some more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a world that has always been foreign to Apple: its past attempts at facilitating social interaction on its platforms are memorable only as the butt of jokes (iTunes Ping anyone?). This isn’t a surprise: Apple’s culture and approach to products &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2016/apples-organizational-crossroads/&quot;&gt;is antithetical&lt;/a&gt; to the culture and approach necessary to create and grow a traditional social network. Apple wants total control and to release as perfect a product it can; a social network requires an iterative approach that is designed to deal with constant variability and edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, though, is why &lt;em&gt;Today at Apple&lt;/em&gt; is compelling, particular Ahrendts’ reference to bringing people together in a “real social way” — and she could not have &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/bfHEnw6Rm-4?t=2154&quot;&gt;emphasized&lt;/a&gt; the word “real” more strongly. Apple is in effect trying to build a social network in the real world, facilitated and controlled by Apple, and betting that customers will continue to pay to gain access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Apple’s Average Revenue per User&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be perfectly clear, I am not arguing that &lt;em&gt;Today at Apple&lt;/em&gt; is the answer to a saturated smartphone market or Apple reaching the limits of price increases. The company is clearly relying on “Services” revenue, which mostly means App Store revenue, a huge portion of which comes from in-app purchases for games, as well as a growing number of subscriptions, some provided by Apple (like Apple Music), but most by 3rd parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this framing of a “real world social network” does provide, though, is insight into where it is Apple’s new reporting falls short. It is all well and good that Apple will now separate Services revenue and its associated cost-of-sales starting next quarter; more insight into Apple’s growth driver is clearly appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is missing, though, is the equivalent of unit sales for Services, specifically, the number of active customers Apple has, and the associated revenue per user. This is the exact metric that matters to social media companies, and to the extent that Apple’s growth is derived from continually monetizing its existing user base over time, it makes sense here as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, an accurate number would very much include device revenue: I laid out in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/apples-middle-age/&quot;&gt;Apple’s Middle Age&lt;/a&gt; that the company’s growth was based on getting more money from its existing user base through higher average selling prices, selling more devices (i.e. Apple Watch, AirPods, HomePod, etc.), and increased services revenue; to the extent Apple is correct that focusing on only devices misses the story, it is also correct that focusing on only Services is misleading as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Apple’s Priorities&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately Cook already declared on &lt;a href=&quot;https://seekingalpha.com/article/4142447-apples-aapl-ceo-tim-cook-q1-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single&quot;&gt;another earnings call last February&lt;/a&gt; that this number isn’t coming:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re not releasing a user number, because we think that the proper way to look at it is to look at active devices. It’s also the one that is the most accurate for us to measure. And so that’s our thinking behind there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two problems with this: first, while an active devices number is helpful, the 1.3 billion number that Apple announced on that February earnings call was the first in two years; it has not been updated since. Second, the number of active devices may be easier for Apple to measure, but it simply isn’t as valuable to investors as the number of active users for reasons Cook stated himself last week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our installed base is growing at double digits, and that’s probably a much more significant metric for us from an ecosystem point of view and customer loyalty, et cetera. The second thing is this is a little bit like if you go to the market and you push your cart up to the cashier and she says, or he says how many units you have in there? It doesn’t matter a lot how many units there are in there in terms of the overall value of what’s in the cart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just “overall value”, though: it’s how many customers there are total, and the ways in which their cart is changing — i.e. what is the installed base, and what is the rate of growth that Cook is referring to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately Apple appears to be most concerned with the top and bottom line. Maestri said just before Cook’s comment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, we make our decisions from a financial standpoint to try and optimize our revenue and our gross margin dollars, and that we think is the focus that is in the best interest of our investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is certainly difficult for anyone, particularly Apple’s investors, to complain about Apple’s revenue and gross margin dollars, going on many years now. For all those years, though, said revenue and profit were based on unit sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Apple is arguing that unit sales is the wrong way to understand its business, but refuses to provide the numbers that underlie the story it wants to tell. It is very fair for investors to be skeptical: both as to whether Apple can ever really be valued independently from device sales, and also if the company, for all its fine rhetoric and stage presentations, is truly prioritizing what drives the revenue and profit instead of revenue and profit themselves. I do think the answer is the former; I just wish Apple would show it with its reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;footnote_0_3790&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;Well, theoretically anyways, in the case of the MacBook Pro [&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/apples-social-network/#identifier_0_3790&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-back-link&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

<title>Why [Insert Thing Here] Is Not a Password Killer</title>
<link>https://www.troyhunt.com/heres-why-insert-thing-here-is-not-a-password-killer/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.troyhunt.com/heres-why-insert-thing-here-is-not-a-password-killer/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;These days, I get a lot of messages from people on security related things. Often it's related to data breaches or sloppy behaviour on behalf of some online service playing fast and loose with HTTPS or passwords or some other easily observable security posture. But on a fairly regular basis, I get an email from someone which effectively boils down to this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, have you seen [insert thing here]? It's totally going to kill passwords!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it's not and to save myself from repeating the same message over and over again, I want to articulate precisely why passwords have a lot of life left in them yet. But firstly, let me provide a high-level overview of the sort of product I'm talking about and I'll begin with recognising the problem it's trying to solve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People suck at passwords. I know, massive shock right? They suck at making genuinely strong ones, they suck at making &lt;em&gt;unique&lt;/em&gt; ones and they suck at handling them in a secure fashion. This leads to everything from simple account takeover (someone else now controls their eBay or their Spotify or whatever else), to financial damages (goods or services bought or sold under their identity) to full on data breaches (many of these occur due to admins reusing credentials). There is no escaping the fact that passwords remain high-risk security propositions for the vast majority of people. Part of the solution to this is to give people the controls to do password-based authentication better, for example by using a password manager and enabling 2FA. But others believe that passwords themselves have to go completely to solve the problem which brings us to proposed alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't want to single any one product out here because the piece I'm writing is bigger than that, so let's talk about patterns instead. I'm referring to passwordless solutions that involves things like QR codes, pictorial representations, 3rd party mobile apps, dedicated hardware devices or &quot;magic&quot; links sent via email. I'm sure there are others but for the purpose of this post, any pattern that doesn't involve entering a username and a password into a couple of input fields is in scope. To their credit, some of these solutions are genuinely very good - &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; very good - but what proponents of them seem to regularly miss is that &quot;technically&quot; isn't enough. Despite their respective merits, every one of these solutions has a massive shortcoming that severely limits their viability and it's something they simply can't compete with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Despite its many flaws, the one thing that the humble password has going for it over technically superior alternatives is that everyone understands how to use it. &lt;em&gt;Everyone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where we need to recognise that decisions around things like auth schemes go well beyond technology merits alone. Arguably, the same could be said about any security control and I've made the point many times before that these things need to be looked at from a very balanced viewpoint. There are merits and there are deficiencies and unless you can recognise both (regardless of how much you agree with them), it's going to be hard to arrive at the best outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me put this in perspective: assume you're tasked with building a new system which has a requirement for registration and subsequently, authentication. You go to the Marketing Manager and say &quot;hey, there's this great product called [insert thing here] that replaces passwords and all you have to do to sign in is...&quot;. And you've already lost the argument because the foremost thing on the Marketing Manager's mind is &lt;em&gt;reducing friction&lt;/em&gt;. Their number one priority is to get people signing up to the service and using it because ultimately, that's what generates revenue or increases brand awareness or customer loyalty or achieves whatever the objective was for creating the service in the first place. As soon as you ask people to start doing something they're not familiar with, the risk of them simply not going through with it amplifies and defeats the whole point of having the service in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't a new discussion either, the one about considering usability alongside security. In fact, we have this discussion every time we build a system that defines minimum criteria for passwords; yes, a min of 20 chars would make for much stronger passwords but no, we very rarely do this because we actually want customers! If you look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/how-long-is-long-enough-minimum-password-lengths-by-the-worlds-top-sites/&quot;&gt;the minimum password length requirements by large online services&lt;/a&gt; you can see the results of this discussion covering a fairly broad spread with Google and Microsoft demanding at least 8 characters, Amazon and Twitter wanting 6 and Netflix requiring... 4. But I'm hesitant to berate Netflix for what seems like an extremely low number because they're also dealing with the usability challenge that is people logging on to TVs with remote controls. The point of all this is that usability is an absolutely essential attribute of the auth discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I often find when I have these discussions is a myopic focus on technical merits. I'll give you an example from earlier last year where someone reached out and espoused the virtues of the solution they'd built. They were &lt;em&gt;emphatic&lt;/em&gt; that passwords were no longer required due to the merits of [insert thing here] and were frustrated that the companies they were approaching weren't entertaining the idea of using their product. I replied and explained pretty much what's outlined above - the conversation is going to get shut down as soon as you start asking companies to impose friction on their users but try as I might, they simply couldn't get the message. &quot;What barrier? There is no barrier!&quot; They went on to say that companies not willing to embrace products like this and educate their users about alternative auth schemes are the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; problem and that they should adjust their behaviour accordingly. I countered with what remains a point that's very hard to argue against:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your product is so awesome, have you stopped to consider why no one is using it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in fairness, it may not be precisely &quot;no one&quot; but in this case and so many of the other [insert things here], I'd never seen them in use before and I do tend to get around the internet a bit. Maybe they're used in very niche corners of the web, the point is that none of these products are exactly taking the industry by storm and there's a very simple reason for that: there's a fundamental usability problem. This particular discussion ended when they replied with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is only negativity that doesn’t allow positiveness to excel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ugh. I'm negative about stuff that's no good, yes. I dropped out of the discussion at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost a year ago, I travelled to Washington DC and sat in front of a room full of congressmen and congresswomen and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/heres-what-im-telling-us-congress-about-data-breaches/&quot;&gt;explained why knowledge-based authentication (KBA) was such a problem in the age of the data breach&lt;/a&gt;. I was asked to testify because of my experience in dealing with data breaches, many of which exposed personal data attributes such as people's date of birth. You know, the thing companies ask you for in order to verify that you are who you say you are! We all recognise the flaws in using static KBA (knowledge of something that can't be changed), but just in case the penny hasn't yet dropped, do a find for &quot;dates of birth&quot; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites&quot;&gt;the list of pwned websites in Have I Been Pwned&lt;/a&gt;. So why do we still use such a clearly fallible means of identity verification? For precisely the same reason we still use the humble password and that's simply because every single person knows how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why passwords aren't going anywhere in the foreseeable future and why [insert thing here] isn't going to kill them. No amount of focusing on how bad passwords are or how many accounts have been breached or what it costs when people can't access their accounts is going to change that. Nor will the technical prowess of [insert thing here] change the discussion because it simply can't compete with passwords on that one metric organisations are so focused on: usability. Sure, there'll be edge cases and certainly there remain scenarios where higher-friction can be justified due to either the nature of the asset being protected or the demographic of the audience, but you're not about to see your everyday e-commerce, social media or even banking sites changing en mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, one more thing: if I don't mention biometrics and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAuthn&quot;&gt;WebAuthn&lt;/a&gt; they'll continually show up in the comments anyway. On the biometrics front, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/face-id-touch-id-pins-no-id-and-pragmatic-security/&quot;&gt;I'm a big supporter of things like Face ID&lt;/a&gt; and Windows Hello (I love my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.logitech.com/en-au/product/brio&quot;&gt;Logitech BRIO&lt;/a&gt; for that). But they don't &lt;em&gt;replace&lt;/em&gt; passwords, rather provide you with an alternate means of authenticating. I still have my Apple account password and my Microsoft password, I just don't use them as frequently. WebAuthn has the potential to be awesome, not least of which because it's a W3C initiative and not a vendor pushing their cyber thing. But it's also extremely early days and even then, as with [insert things here], it will lead to a change in process that brings with it friction. The difference though - &lt;em&gt;the great hope&lt;/em&gt; - is that it might redefine authentication to online services in an open, standardised way and ultimately achieve broad adoption. But that's many years out yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are we left with? What's actually being recommended and, indeed, adopted? Well to start with, there's lots of great guidance from the likes of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) in the UK and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the US. I summarised many of the highlights in my post last year about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/passwords-evolved-authentication-guidance-for-the-modern-era/&quot;&gt;Passwords Evolved: Authentication Guidance for the Modern Era&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of that piece (and following one of the NIST recommendations), I subsequently launched the free &lt;a href=&quot;https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords&quot;&gt;Pwned Passwords&lt;/a&gt; service which is being used by a heap of online entities including EVE Online and GitHub. This (along with many of the other NCSC or NIST recommendations) &lt;em&gt;improves&lt;/em&gt; the password situation rather than solves it and it does it without fundamentally changing the way people authenticate. Every single solution I've seen that claims to &quot;solve the password problem&quot; just adds another challenge in its place thus introducing a new set of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why [insert thing here] is not a password killer and why, for the foreseeable future, we're just going to have to continue getting better at the one authentication scheme that everyone knows how to use: passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>KDE Connect 1.10 released</title>
<link>https://nicolasfella.wordpress.com/2018/11/04/kde-connect-new-stuff-0x3/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://nicolasfella.wordpress.com/2018/11/04/kde-connect-new-stuff-0x3/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today we released version 1.10 of the KDE Connect Android app. Therefore it’s time again to share what we’ve been working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Targeting Android Oreo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of this month app updates uploaded to Google Play need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/target-sdk&quot;&gt;target Android 8&lt;/a&gt;. This has several implications. Targeting Oreo comes with an updated Support Library, which forces us to drop support for Android 4.0 and below. According to our Google Play data this will affect approximately 400 users. We are very sorry about that, but these users won’t receive further updates. Furthermore, Android Oreo introduced some restrictions in regard to apps running in the background. In the future in order to be able to run in the background KDE Connect needs to show a persistent notification. The good news is that you can hide the notification. The (slightly) bad news is that we cannot do it by default. To hide the notification you need to long-press it and switch it off. Other notifications from KDE Connect are unaffected by this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1.10 Changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the main changes of version 1.10. Not mentioned are countless small improvements and under-the-hood changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mouse input now works with the same speed independent from the phones pixel density.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media controller now allows stopping playback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run command supports triggering commands using kdeconnect:// URLs. Useful for integration with NFC tags and 3rd-party apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notification filter allows quickly (de-)selecting all apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several settings scatterd across the UI have been bundled into a single settings screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of work has gone into how we handle SMS on the Android side in preparation for something huge. Stay tuned 😉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desktop side has improved as well since my last post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The windows build of KDE Connect gained support for keyboard input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plasmoid gained a couple of additions. In my last update I mentioned that it is possible to run commands from there. It is now also possible to lauch the command setup from there. Furthermore it is now possible to select files to share them from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Linux Mobile App gained many visual improvements and features. It now supports sharing files and controlling the system volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are using &lt;a href=&quot;https://volkerkrause.eu/2018/08/19/kde-itinerary-introduction.html&quot;&gt;Itinerary&lt;/a&gt; you can send booking information from the PC directly to the phone via KDE Connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now possible to send files directly from Pantheon Files (and other Elementary apps) and Thunar via KDE Connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, there are countless other improvements that I did not explicitly mention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big thanks to all people who contributed to this!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>As women have more equal opportunity, the more their preferences differ from men</title>
<link>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6412/eaas9899</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6412/eaas9899</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section editor-summary&quot; id=&quot;abstract-1&quot; readability=&quot;18.732864674868&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Assessing gender differences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-2&quot;&gt;What contributes to gender-associated differences in preferences such as the willingness to take risks, patience, altruism, positive and negative reciprocity, and trust? Falk and Hermle studied 80,000 individuals in 76 countries who participated in a Global Preference Survey and compared the data with country-level variables such as gross domestic product and indices of gender inequality. They observed that the more that women have equal opportunities, the more they differ from men in their preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-3&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, this issue p. &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aas9899&quot;&gt;eaas9899&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section structured&quot; id=&quot;abstract-3&quot; readability=&quot;37.001050420168&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Structured Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;sec-1&quot; class=&quot;subsection&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-5&quot;&gt;Understanding determinants of gender differences in economic and social domains has been of interest, both in academic and public debates. Previous research has shown that gender differences in fundamental economic preferences are important in explaining gender differences in economic outcomes, such as for occupational choice, financial investment, or educational decisions, among many others. However, gaps remain in understanding the sources of gender differences in preferences and their variation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;sec-2&quot; class=&quot;subsection&quot; readability=&quot;28&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;RATIONALE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-6&quot;&gt;We contrasted and tested two hypotheses that make opposite predictions concerning the cross-country association of gender differences in preferences with economic development and gender equality. On one hand, the attenuation of gender-specific social roles that arises in more developed and gender-egalitarian countries may alleviate differences in preferences between women and men. As a consequence, one would expect gender differences in preferences to be negatively associated with higher levels of economic development and gender equality (social role hypothesis). On the other hand, greater availability of material and social resources removes the gender-neutral goal of subsistence, which creates the scope for gender-specific ambitions and desires. In addition, more gender-equal access to those resources may allow women and men to express preferences independently from each other. As a consequence, one would expect gender differences in preferences to be positively associated with higher levels of economic development and gender equality (resource hypothesis).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-7&quot;&gt;We tested these competing predictions using data on experimentally validated measures of willingness to take risks, patience, altruism, positive and negative reciprocity, and trust for 80,000 individuals in 76 representative country samples. So that the data would be geographically representative, the dataset was chosen so as to include all continents and a broad range of cultures and economic development levels. In total, the data represent about 90% of both the world population and global income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-8&quot;&gt;The data revealed substantial cross-country variation in gender differences in preferences. Gender differences were found to be strongly positively associated with economic development as well as gender equality. These relationships held for each preference separately as well as for a summary index of differences in all preferences jointly. Quantitatively, this summary index exhibited correlations of 0.67 (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) with log GDP per capita and 0.56 (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) with a Gender Equality Index (a joint measure of four indices of gender equality), respectively. To isolate the separate impacts of economic development and gender equality, we conducted a conditional analysis, finding a quantitatively large and statistically significant association between gender differences and log GDP per capita conditional on the Gender Equality Index, and vice versa. These findings remained robust in several validation tests, such as accounting for potential culture-specific survey response behavior, aggregation bias, and nonlinear relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-9&quot;&gt;The reported evidence indicates that higher levels of economic development and gender equality favor the manifestation of gender differences in preferences across countries. Our results highlight the critical role of availability of material and social resources, as well as gender-equal access to these resources, in facilitating the independent formation and expression of gender-specific preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;p-11&quot;&gt;Preferences concerning time, risk, and social interactions systematically shape human behavior and contribute to differential economic and social outcomes between women and men. We present a global investigation of gender differences in six fundamental preferences. Our data consist of measures of willingness to take risks, patience, altruism, positive and negative reciprocity, and trust for 80,000 individuals in 76 representative country samples. Gender differences in preferences were positively related to economic development and gender equality.

<og:description>What contributes to gender-associated differences in preferences such as the willingness to take risks, patience, altruism, positive and negative reciprocity, and trust? Falk and Hermle studied 80,000 individuals in 76 countries who participated in a Global Preference Survey and compared the data with country-level variables such as gross domestic product and indices of gender inequality. They observed that the more that women have equal opportunities, the more they differ from men in their preferences. Science , this issue p. [eaas9899][1] ### INTRODUCTION Understanding determinants of gender differences in economic and social domains has been of interest, both in academic and public debates. Previous research has shown that gender differences in fundamental economic preferences are important in explaining gender differences in economic outcomes, such as for occupational choice, financial investment, or educational decisions, among many others. However, gaps remain in understanding the sources of gender differences in preferences and their variation. ### RATIONALE We contrasted and tested two hypotheses that make opposite predictions concerning the cross-country association of gender differences in preferences with economic development and gender equality. On one hand, the attenuation of gender-specific social roles that arises in more developed and gender-egalitarian countries may alleviate differences in preferences between women and men. As a consequence, one would expect gender differences in preferences to be negatively associated with higher levels of economic development and gender equality (social role hypothesis). On the other hand, greater availability of material and social resources removes the gender-neutral goal of subsistence, which creates the scope for gender-specific ambitions and desires. In addition, more gender-equal access to those resources may allow women and men to express preferences independently from each other. As a consequence, one would expect gender differences in preferences to be positively associated with higher levels of economic development and gender equality (resource hypothesis). We tested these competing predictions using data on experimentally validated measures of willingness to take risks, patience, altruism, positive and negative reciprocity, and trust for 80,000 individuals in 76 representative country samples. So that the data would be geographically representative, the dataset was chosen so as to include all continents and a broad range of cultures and economic development levels. In total, the data represent about 90% of both the world population and global income. ### RESULTS The data revealed substantial cross-country variation in gender differences in preferences. Gender differences were found to be strongly positively associated with economic development as well as gender equality. These relationships held for each preference separately as well as for a summary index of differences in all preferences jointly. Quantitatively, this summary index exhibited correlations of 0.67 ( P &lt; 0.0001) with log GDP per capita and 0.56 ( P &lt; 0.0001) with a Gender Equality Index (a joint measure of four indices of gender equality), respectively. To isolate the separate impacts of economic development and gender equality, we conducted a conditional analysis, finding a quantitatively large and statistically significant association between gender differences and log GDP per capita conditional on the Gender Equality Index, and vice versa. These findings remained robust in several validation tests, such as accounting for potential culture-specific survey response behavior, aggregation bias, and nonlinear relationships. ### CONCLUSION The reported evidence indicates that higher levels of economic development and gender equality favor the manifestation of gender differences in preferences across countries. Our results highlight the critical role of availability of material and social resources, as well as gender-equal access to these resources, in facilitating the independent formation and expression of gender-specific preferences. ![Figure][2]&lt;/img&gt; Gender differences in preferences across countries and their association with economic development and gender equality.

<title>Don’t sign a CLA</title>
<link>https://drewdevault.com/2018/10/05/Dont-sign-a-CLA.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://drewdevault.com/2018/10/05/Dont-sign-a-CLA.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A large minority of open-source projects come with a CLA, or Contributor License Agreement, and require you to sign one before they’ll merge your patch. These agreements typically ask you to go above and beyond the rights you afford the project by contributing under the license the software is distributed with. And you should never sign one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Free and open source software licenses grant explicit freedoms to three groups: the maintainers, the users, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the contributors. An important freedom is the freedom to make changes to the software and to distribute these changes to the public. The natural place to do so is by contributing to the upstream project, something a project should be thankful for. A CLA replaces this gratitude with an attempt to weaken these freedoms in a manner which may stand up to the letter of the license, but is far from the spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CLA is a kick in the groin to a contributor’s good-faith contribution to the project. Many people, myself included, contribute to open source projects under the assumption that my contributions will help serve a project which continues to be open source in perpetuity, and a CLA provides a means for the project maintainers to circumvent that. What the CLA is actually used for is to give the project maintainers the ability to relicense your work under a more restrictive software license, up to and including making it entirely closed source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen this happen before. Consider the Redis Labs debacle, where they adopted the nonfree&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;/&gt; Anti-Commons Clause&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;/&gt;, and used their CLA to pull along any external contributions for the ride. As thanks for the generous time invested by their community into their software, they yank it out from underneath it and repurpose it to make money with an obscenely nonfree product. Open source is a commitment to your community. Once you make it, you cannot take it back. You don’t get the benefits associated with being an open source project if you have an exit hatch. You may argue that it’s your right to do what you want with your project, but making it open source is &lt;em&gt;explicitly waiving that right&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to you, the contributor: if you are contributing to open source and you want it to stay that way, you should not sign a CLA. When you send a patch to a project, you are affording them the same rights they afforded you. The relationship is one of equals. This is a healthy balance. When you sign a CLA, you give them unequal power over you. If you’re scratching an itch and just want to submit the patch in good faith, it’s easy enough to fork the project and put up your changes in a separate place. This is a right afforded to you by every open source license, and it’s easy to do. Anyone who wants to use your work can apply your patches on top of the upstream software. Don’t sign away your rights!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some responses to the discussion around this article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apache.org/licenses/cla-corporate.txt&quot;&gt;Apache Foundation CLA&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/em&gt; This CLA is one of the better ones, because it doesn’t transfer copyright over your work to the Apache Foundation. I have no beef with clauses 1 and 3-8. However, term 2 is too broad and I would not sign this CLA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What about the Linux kernel &lt;a href=&quot;https://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin&quot;&gt;developer certificate of origin&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/em&gt; I applaud the Linux kernel’s approach here. It covers their bases while still strongly protecting the rights of the patch owner. It’s a short statement with little legalese and little fanfare to agreeing to it (just add “Signed-off By” to your commit message). I approve.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Amazon private label brands are quietly taking over Amazon.com</title>
<link>https://qz.com/1414238/secret-amazon-brands-are-quietly-taking-over-amazon-com/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://qz.com/1414238/secret-amazon-brands-are-quietly-taking-over-amazon-com/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Arabella. Lark &amp;amp; Roe. Mae. NuPro. Small Parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;You might not know it from their names, but these brands all &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1039381/amazon-owns-a-whole-collection-of-secret-brands/&quot;&gt;belong to Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Amazon’s private label business is booming, on pace to generate $7.5 billion this year and $25 billion by 2022, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/04/amazon-quietly-launched-a-new-accelerator-program-to-create-more-brands-exclusively-sold-on-its-website.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain&quot;&gt;according to estimates&lt;/a&gt; from investment firm SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. To accelerate that growth, the company is inviting manufacturers to create products exclusively for its collection of private brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;The “Amazon Accelerator Program” is hiring a senior product manager for private brands, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/04/amazon-quietly-launched-a-new-accelerator-program-to-create-more-brands-exclusively-sold-on-its-website.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain&quot;&gt;CNBC reported&lt;/a&gt;. The job &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/701918/sr-product-manager-private-brands&quot;&gt;listing&lt;/a&gt; invites applicants to “invent and Think Big to take an idea from concept to reality for Amazon customers.” Duties include managing and planning inventory, identifying business opportunities, and working across a wide swath of Amazon divisions, including consumables, Prime Pantry, Prime Fresh, Prime Now, and Amazon Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Another job listing spotted by CNBC, for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.jobs/en-gb/jobs/724740/program-leader-private-brands&quot;&gt;private brands program leader&lt;/a&gt;, notes that the “Private Brands team is rapidly expanding and is looking for an exceptional product leader to grow the business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Brands created through the accelerator will be exclusive to Amazon, but not owned by it, the company said. Manufacturers will create, produce, trademark, and own the products they offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;“Amazon Accelerator creates new opportunities for manufacturers and offers a way for them to launch brands and products directly to Amazon customers,” an Amazon spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “For customers, this program adds products to our assortment and allows us to offer an even wider selection of high quality products at a great value.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Amazon’s push into private labels could threaten the third-party sellers who do business on its website, and are important to the company’s own bottom line. Amazon generated $9.7 billion in revenue from commissions and services it provided to third-party sellers (e.g., fulfillment and shipping fees) in the latest quarter, ended July 26. Earlier this week, eBay sent Amazon a cease-and-desist accusing it of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1413463/amazon-is-poaching-ebay-sellers-ebay-says/&quot;&gt;shady, multiyear campaign&lt;/a&gt; to lure eBay sellers over to the Amazon marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;But the massive volume of stuff peddled by third-party sellers &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1256651/amazon-marketplace-sold-more-stuff-than-amazon-itself-in-2017/&quot;&gt;also creates problems&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon at times has struggled to police offensive products, or to banish counterfeits from the marketplace. Private label brands created by Amazon and manufacturers it works with exclusively could help the company get a tighter grip on the quality of merchandise sold across the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/02/amazon-is-testing-a-new-feature-that-promotes-its-private-label-brands-inside-a-competitors-product-listing.html&quot;&gt;separate report by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon has been promoting its house brands at the bottom of listings for competitors’ products.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Best Article Ever Written About Bragging</title>
<link>https://www.lesspenguiny.com/articles/best-article-on-bragging</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.lesspenguiny.com/articles/best-article-on-bragging</guid>
<description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-the-calling&quot;&gt;I The Calling&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some years back I met a man while in Germany. Both of us had been in the country for about half a year, so it was sort of inevitable that the question dreaded by every foreigner who has ever failed to learn the local language popped up: How good is your Deutsche?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not very” I answered, weary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WELL… &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; had learned German within three weeks of arriving. By going out to bars, he added, leaving a vicious pause for effect. Not only was he so intelligent that he could master that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.utah.edu/~gback/awfgrmlg.html&quot;&gt;awful language&lt;/a&gt; in weeks, but he didn’t even have to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/blatant.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pictorial representation of the effect on my ego.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation toiled onwards, and it soon became apparent that he was better than me in every conceivable dimension — and probably a few I couldn’t fathom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an eclectic taste in human beings, often prizing the company of those who others shun; but no well is infinitely deep. I wanted to eject from the conversation. In fact, I never wanted to see this guy’s face again — not even in a weird, clinical “how much bragging can I endure” way. So I left, genuinely curious about whether this guy’s own mother returned his calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the ensuing days, I reflected about how unpleasant I had found the exchange. Was I justified in feeling so repulsed by this guy or was I just being a sensitive snowflake? There was also a deeper question mulling around my mind, a psychological puzzle: It’s more-or-less common knowledge that everyone hates bragging, so why do people keep on doing it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final riddle riddled me: Why was I repulsed by some people’s bragging behaviors, yet could tolerate — heck, in some special cases, was even riveted by — other’s? What was it that distinguished a repellent brag from a palatable one, a Kayne Wester from a Clooney?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/ScreenShot2018-09-18at165847.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever eager for an excuse to create lists, I began documenting the brags I heard in my surroundings. Most were in my social outings, others were online, and others again were taken from pop culture. What I discovered was that there is a remarkable number of different modes of bragging, ranging from the grating to the gracious. Some of these styles are received so poorly that they destroy one’s social credibility and invite public ridicule. But equally, there are others that blend so effortlessly into normal conversation that the average listener would be hard-pressed to count them as bragging at all. Say hello to Bilbo Braggins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was only by learning to recognize these various modes of bragging — such as the Humblebrag, the Reflected Glory Brag and the Race to the Bottom Brag — that I was able to become aware of how often it is that I brag. Which turned out to be quite a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ii-what-is-bragging&quot;&gt;II What Is Bragging?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait. We’ve gotten ahead of ourselves, in that we haven’t yet defined what bragging is. Any definition should capture the clearcut case of diehard braggarts, the kinds of people who never seem more than five minutes away from commissioning statues of themselves. It also ought to encompass certain edge cases, like oversharing on social media or Humblebragging. At the same time, the definition should not be too general — if we don’t trim the conceptual edges, we might interpret near every human utterance or action as a brag — e.g. “The reason Sean Mc Shawnerson doesn’t smoke is to implicitly brag about his willpower”. There may be a spark of truth to this character reading, but it doesn’t really map onto our common sense view of what bragging is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/ScreenShot2018-09-18at190447.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Michael Jackson HIStory statue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revealing impressive information when it crops up naturally ought to be excluded from our definition: If someone asks you what part of New York you live in, and it happens to be The Hamptons, it isn’t bragging to answer the question honestly. Otherwise we’d have to consider the entire existences of the well-to-dos and the fortunate as never-ending, thundering bragathons. That’s not to say there isn’t some nuance here: The labelling flips back over into being bragging if you disclosed your Hamptons address in a self-satisfied, how-do-you-like-that manner, leaving an expectant pause afterwards to squeeze the maximum impact out of the reveal. Also, if you are aware that answering a direct question is going to reveal something uppity like “The Hamptons” then tacking on a few words of real or jokey humility, e.g. “—the bad part ;-)”, doesn’t cost you anything yet it’s a graceful way to lessen the potentially belittling bite the audience might feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analogously, filling out your LinkedIn with relevant achievements isn’t really bragging either — you’re simply answering the question the platform implicitly asked. And something else is reasonable about it: You don’t impose your status. It is the other party who chooses to look you up on LinkedIn and research your professional achievements, i.e. they are the ones who opened Pandora’s Box. On this note, how cool would it be if you met the pope on his day off, thought he was a regular bloke, then looked him up on LinkedIn afterwards and saw the bio: “Supreme Pontiff, Leader of the Vatican City, Bishop of Rome; I’m also a great cook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/ScreenShot2018-09-26at115434.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to point, arrogant and self-serving world views should also be left out of our definition. I met a type-A++ lady at a soirée who harped on about how (cue riding-school voice) “the key to a well-developed mind is musical training”. I found out later — and this is crucial — &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; her bringing the point up, that she had played violin for 15 years. Whilst this indicates that she has rigged her value system in her favor, I wouldn’t call it bragging since she never intended to tell me she had a well-developed mind. Her haughty self-perception merely oozed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I hazard a definition of bragging, I’d ask you not to hold me hostage to it — this isn’t Nature magazine, as you might have inferred from the immature tone. So here goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bragging is personally imposing what-you-believe-to-be status-elevating thoughts on your audience.&lt;/strong&gt; (Shakespeare, eat your heart out.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Imposing” is self-explanatory, in that most of us consider bragging to involve an element of undue pushiness in communicating status. “Personally” captures the sense that most of us view bragging as being self-initiated, a kind of self promotion. The part about “what-you-believe-to-be” is there because if someone bragged about how they got so drunk that they went blind for three days hur hur, most of would consider this bragging, even though the speaker’s status has dropped by any objective standard. What matters is that, according to this person’s skewed accounting, they believed their statements would raise their stock; the fact that they had the opposite effect is irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;iii-the-17-modes-of-bragging&quot;&gt;III The 17 Modes of Bragging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modes below are presented separately, but the underlying reality has so much messy overlap that, unless you’re careful, you risk tripping over a stray Venn diagram. Considered as social media — a fitting comparison for anything remotely related to bragging — these modes are the hashtags that could apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each brag will be rated with a 100% scientific system where 0 penguins means deft and 10 dire, i.e. the less penguins the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-bare-bones-basic-brag&quot;&gt;1. Bare-Bones Basic Brag&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 2017 UK edition of TV show The Apprentice, contestant Ross declared, live, on one of Britain’s most watched programs, that he was, “statistically speaking, very smart,” and that he was an “official genius” — which he was proud of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/JWFsUe88gow&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert: This didn’t exactly go swimmingly for young Ross — neither Lord Alan Sugar nor the army of viewers tweeting in were particularly impressed. As one angry commenter put it, “I bet this genius still live[sic] with his mother”. Or another, “statistically speaking, a prick”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bare-Bones Basic Brag consists in directly telling your audience that you are great or rich or clever or whatever. What defines this mode is that no attempt at plausible deniability is made; the brag is served raw, without the need for any inference on the audience’s behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credibility of a Bare-Bones Basic Brag can be improved slightly by mentioning a third party arbiter of the status — “&lt;em&gt;my boss&lt;/em&gt; says I’m gifted at presentations”. &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0190272511432939?journalCode=spqc&quot;&gt;Susan Speer’s research&lt;/a&gt; backs up this idea that quoting someone else’s opinion improves the brag (or “self-praise”, as she chooses to word it). This has its limits, however: my dating life took a decades-long turn for the worse with “My mom thinks I’m handsome”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTW Wiser braggarts wouldn’t say that they have a high IQ, like Ross, to his peril, did above; rather they’d nonchalantly mention how they saw their old friends from Cambridge last weekend, leaving the audience to join the dots. Hopefully correctly, “Ahh, so you’re a bus-driver?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: 8 Penguins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-oneupmanship-brag&quot;&gt;2. Oneupmanship Brag&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/one-up.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: “I had the most amazing Indian food recently.”&lt;br/&gt;Oneup-er: “Which restaurant? TBH you can’t really get good Indian in America. You really have to visit India for the authentic experience.”&lt;br/&gt;Me: “Exactly, that’s where I ate. I arrived back from Goa last night.”&lt;br/&gt;Oneup-er: “Ah, but did you eat in Peep Kitchen? It’s by far the best but it takes three weeks to get a reservation.”&lt;br/&gt;Me: “OMG their paneer tikka masala is to die for!”&lt;br/&gt;Oneup-er: “OH YEA WELL DID MR. PATEL SING THE ENTIRE LION KING SOUNDTRACK TO YOU WHILE SERVING YOU PAPADUM!?!?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oneupmanship Brag is a real stinker. The defining characteristic is its trigger; specifically, it occurs in immediate response to the revelation of status-conferring information about someone else. It’s irrelevant whether the original speaker was bragging — what matters is that the Oneupmanship Bragger tops him or her in a comparable dimension. (For equalizing of status, see the Reciprocation Brag).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heinous thing about the Oneupmanship Brag is that it steals the limelight at exactly the moment when the original speaker is shown flatteringly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we’re on this topic, I’d also like to highlight a certain style of Oneupmanship Brag which not only one-ups the original speaker but also shuts down the entire discussion, preventing the Oneupmanship Braggart from any possible dethroning. Watch and learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: “I’m so wrecked. I only slept 2 hours later night.”&lt;br/&gt;Oneup-er: “You can’t possibly know what is it to be tired until you have kids.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last brag, by the way, is also an example of a Race to the Bottom Brag. We’ll cover this odd little beast later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: 10 Penguins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-reciprocation-brag&quot;&gt;3. Reciprocation Brag&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In How I Met Your Mother episode 7 (Matchmaker), character Ted Mosby meets a medical doctor he’s attracted to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr: “Hi I’m Dr. ‘O Brien”.&lt;br/&gt;Ted: “Hi I’m Architect Mosby… Sorry, I just wanted to say my job too”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/ScreenShot2018-09-19at154959.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like this, which is unusual for me since I usually want to throw things at Ted. As he hints at in the dialogue above, Ted is simply reciprocating the status game already begun by the doctor’s ritualistic communication of title. It helps that his quip was funny too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line between the benign Reciprocation Brag and the uglier Oneupmanship Brag is worth paying attention to. Both brags are triggered by status-conferring information imparted by another. The Reciprocation Brag differs, however, in that the braggart’s intention isn’t to tower over so much as to close the gap. The goal isn’t to prove that you are better; only that you’re in a comparable league. Arguably too, it puts the original speaker at ease, say if the doctor felt ambivalent about having revealed her status. Prognosis: positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-bullshit-brag&quot;&gt;4. Bullshit Brag&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember, with no shortage of cringe, a time I attended a skills exchange meet-up totally alone and found myself speaking with some British programmers. For reasons unknown to me, and seemingly without my having any choice in the matter, my mouth proclaimed that I coded in certain prestigious programming languages that are usually off limits to mere mortals. I claimed that I was both a Haskell and Lisp programmer, a statement that you can roughly translate into non-programmer talk as “I only listen to My Bloody Valentine shoe-gaze and Radiohead B-sides played in reverse”. The Brits acted impressed, but likely only out of politeness — techie culture dictates that it’s practically a faux pas NOT to tip your hat to Haskell / Lisp programmers. I felt a temporary elevation through my dishonestly begotten admiration but I hated myself for weeks afterwards. I even considered learning the damn languages, just to resolve the dissonance. All in all, I felt like my essence was reduced to that of a monkey pulling a lever for bananas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There need not be a blatant, bald-faced lie for a brag to amount to a Bullshit Brag; within its scope falls a variety of omissions and misdirections. If a braggart’s salary was exactly $100,000, they might describe it as “6 figures”, the ambiguity (and poor general knowledge of power law distributions) serving to suggest it was higher. But if it were $99,999, a mere dollar lower, I bet they would sooner describe it as “99k” than “5 figures”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another common, if rather odd, example of misdirection is performance eating. Abigail is skinny; thankfully not quite anorexic but worryingly close. Whenever I dine with her, she orders regular-enough sized meals, but draws inordinate attention to her appetite, indeed even going so far as to call others at the table “weak eaters”. One of her favorite topics is the “ridiculous” amount of food she eats. Sorry Abby, but no-one’s swallowing it; the laws of caloric physics deny your claims, and besides, eating a healthy diet of nothing but coffee and cigarettes before 8pm isn’t exactly gluttony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Performance Eating. Top: What you eat when everyone’s watching. Bottom: What you eat when no-one’s around.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abigail, in her idiosyncratic way, was Bullshit Bragging because she must have known she was misleading listeners. Leaving the mode of bragging aside, the &lt;em&gt;message&lt;/em&gt; she was sending also warrants attention — what was it she was hoping to communicate here? Don’t worry — we’ll delve into these details in a later article. I’m such a tease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I view many showy social media posts as Bullshit Brags, in the sense that the snippets posted online usually skip the bad. Certain lifestyles (like traveling for work), while they have their highs (like seeing beautiful new cityscapes), also have downsides that can outweigh the good (like waking up at 3am to get to the client’s office by 9am, which happens to be in some grubby industrial park approximately 4 million km from the nearest Instagram photo). By only ever posting the highlights, which somehow became the convention on social media, audiences get misled about how good or bad their relative lots happen to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-out-of-nowhere-brag&quot;&gt;5. Out-Of-Nowhere Brag&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/contextFree.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: “… and that concludes my opinion on what’s wrong with falafel.”&lt;br/&gt;*lul in conversation*.&lt;br/&gt;Out-Of-Nowhere Braggart: “I’m feeling good thinking about how my business is killing it lately; $400,000 in sales this quarter — BOOM”.&lt;br/&gt;Me: “good for you man, though I wasn’t asking…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Out-Of-Nowhere Brag denotes those jarring brags that appear out of the blue, strident context-free sucker punches with no conceivable connection to the current conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out-Of-Nowhere Brags are rather rare. Typically they occur when the speaker wants that dopamine rush of sharing perceived superiority so badly that they can’t bring themselves to wait until the right moment arises. The problem with Out-Of-Nowhere Brags is that, by virtue of not matching the topic of the conversation, they attract added attention to the self-praise. They blend in exactly like a skinhead at a women’s rights rally doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook and related social-media are basically built, ground-up, for Out-Of-Nowhere Brags. Whenever you post publicly, you’re essentially starting a new thread of conversation. For certain people — and we all know a few who fit the bill — the post feature’s sole reason for existing is to bombard audiences with envy-provoking snippets of their lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I’m worried about keeping the green goblin at bay, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en&quot;&gt;block my Facebook wall&lt;/a&gt; and personally it’s been the best thing in years for my self-esteem. But before I did, I would be served with daily nuggets of spiritual nourishment like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few would doubt that the above constitutes bragging. But often it’s difficult to draw the line in social media. I’ll have to more to say about this in the section on Moved by the Moment Brags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-showmanship-brag&quot;&gt;6. Showmanship Brag&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/showmanship-peanuts.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through begrudging duties to a mutual friend, I ended up spending an evening in Germany with a self-satisfied &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rhodesscholar.org/&quot;&gt;Rhodes scholar&lt;/a&gt;. As the night progressed, he would fill the gaps in our conversation by talking to himself, aloud, in German (“Ach so, meine Nase ist aber JAHRHUNDERTEALT”), despite none of our motley crew of tourists and new-in-towns understanding a word of it. His manner of flaunting his linguistic knowledge is a prime example of the “show-off don’t tell” approach to bragging. I assume that he believed he’d found a clever hack to force his erudition down our throats without debasing himself by making crass, self-glorifying statements like “My mind is the most extraordinary locus of learning humanity has known since the great libraries of Alexandria were set aflame”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mode differs from other brags in that the actions do the talking. This has the advantage, to the braggart, that their claims are more credible, actions generally being more difficult to fake than words. If I burst out, unsolicited, into song, and I sound good, you might resent my showiness, but you couldn’t deny my demonstrated skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the performance involved in the Showmanship Brag can even be to everyone’s benefit, as anyone lucky enough to know a proud cook can attest. Unlike the selfish showiness of the Rhodes scholar above, displays of culinary skill are likely to go down a treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyday examples of Showmanship Bragging occur whenever there is money involved. You’re one of four in a taxi, and you’ve arrived at your home. The meter reads $27.50, and you hand over $30 and strut off, devil-may-care about receiving any change. The rest of the gang protest that you’ve paid far too much for your share of the ride, but you slur “it’s fiiiyyynne”, feeling smug about your material wealth and magnanimity. That’s Showmanship Bragging in action. For similar examples, observe the way well-off middle-aged people quarrel over who pays a group bill in a restaurant. (Except if they have names like Frau Pfannkuchen and are German).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/ScreenShot2018-09-19at122522.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Undercover Brag (a term coined by &lt;a href=&quot;https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/07/7-ways-to-be-insufferable-on-facebook.html&quot;&gt;WhatButWhy&lt;/a&gt;) is all about disguising a brag in some other, more socially acceptable form. Most commonly, the brag is masked as a complaint (the infamous Humblebrag), congratulations, advice, or a thank-you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;7a-humblebrag&quot;&gt;7a. Humblebrag&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;blockquote class=”imgur-embed-pub” lang=”en” data-id=”h6KQ35k”&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=”//imgur.com/h6KQ35k”&amp;gt;Just heartbreaking.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;script async src=”//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js” charset=”utf-8”&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heart-breaking. Notice the double brag — as well as getting 96% in the most recent quiz, OP also had a perfect grade in the past.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence of the Humblebrag involves masking status elevating remarks as complaints or humility, e.g. “I don’t like that video game. It’s too easy and I get bored.” All of us are guilty of an occasional Humble Brag. This is partly thanks to having to answer the perennial job interview clanger, “What’s your greatest weakness?”, with responses like, “I work so hard that my personal life suffers” and ideally not like “children”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to straightforward bragging, is Humblebragging received more or less favorably? &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2597626&quot;&gt;Gino, Norton, and Sezer’s research&lt;/a&gt;) suggests it isn’t — i.e. that the Humblebragging style of self-presentation is ineffective. In one arm of their study, a confederate approached students on a college campus asking them to sign a petition. As part of the conversation she asked, “What are you up to this summer?” The confederate then waited for the participant’s response and alternated her script, either delivering a brag about her summer plans, “That’s cool! I got my dream internship and got funding to travel to Paris,” or a Humblebrag: “That’s cool! I got my dream internship and got funding to travel to Paris. &lt;em&gt;Ugh&lt;/em&gt; it’s so hard to decide which one to choose.” Participants in the Humblebragging condition were less likely to sign the petition than participants in the regular bragging condition: 64.9% (37 out of 57) compared to 85.7% (48 out of 57).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meet Travis: Serial entrepreneur, serial failure. 13 years’ of not making it… Along with about 4,000 other people, I’m “friends” with Travis on Facebook, but I have yet to see a post of his that wasn’t a brag. In fact, whenever I encounter one that isn’t boastful in an immediately obvious way, I treat it as a kind of bragging sudoku, the puzzle consisting of figuring out how he’s engineered the post to praise himself. All said, Travis is the kind of guy who could twist a funeral card into a personal tribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I was browsing Facebook one afternoon when I noticed that Travis wished Olympic table tennis player So-and-So good luck with their match tomorrow. How uncharacteristically selfless! This warrants closer reading: It turned out that Travis had mentioned further down that he and So-and-So played in the Australian table-tennis finals squad — when they were 8. And guess what? Travis won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bingo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travis was nicknamed “Travisty” behind his back, and with good reason. His brag has elements of a remote Oneupmanship Brag, in the sense that the person he was one-uping wasn’t privy to the conversation. What sickened me most about the whole affair was that Travis thought he’d camouflaged his brag, that his audience was so naive that it wouldn’t see his impression-engineering for the insincere horror show it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mother had her 11-month old baby in a sling and an overbearing lady approached her in the supermarket to say, “The reason your child can’t walk is because you’re carrying it all the time. My baby was walking with 7 months.” Here’s what the mother was thinking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/parenting-advice.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I deliver advice to you, it carries the connotation that I’m the expert and you’re the no-nothing, so with these power dynamics it’s little wonder that it can feel belittling, especially when the advice is unsolicited. Things get even worse when the vehicle of advice is requisitioned to carry a stealthy bragging payload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;7d-inexplicably-public-thank-you-brag&quot;&gt;7d. Inexplicably-Public Thank You Brag&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A status-crazed acquaintance posted something like this on Facebook:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The memories (&lt;strong&gt;@J Aldwin&lt;/strong&gt;) (!), the friends I made (looking at you &lt;strong&gt;@Singularity Team&lt;/strong&gt;), and the experiences I had at the &lt;strong&gt;@International Space University&lt;/strong&gt; (ISU) are…just…priceless. So glad to have been able to participate. A thousand thanks to &lt;strong&gt;@Douglas&lt;/strong&gt; and team for running the show, to &lt;strong&gt;@Saturn Capital&lt;/strong&gt; for bankrolling my scholarship, and to &lt;strong&gt;@Elon Musk&lt;/strong&gt; for squeezing in time in his crazy schedule for our induction. You’re all such legends. Heartbroken here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mode dresses up a brag as a thank-you that’s posted publicly instead of sent through the usual private channels. Assuming maximum cynicism — my trademark — the thought going through my acquaintance’s mind was this: Thanking people and showing gratefulness is noble, and I cannot be faulted for this. By being strategic about who I thank for what and where, I can broadcast my own glory in a sanctioned way. Better yet, if I tag those I’m thanking, they’ll feel the tug of social duty to like my post, further amplifying my message’s reach, rocketing me to planet glory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;8-outsourced-brag&quot;&gt;8. Outsourced “Brag”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/outsourced.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say I’m introducing you to some fresh faces, be it at a party or over email. I could say, “Meet Alice — she’s been published in all the major journals for her daring experiments on strawberry-mint jam, and her latest paper has been cited more than a billion times this year alone — and today is only Jan 2nd.” In my doing so, you get all the benefits of bragging without getting your hands dirty and incurring the costs. Moreover, this form of introduction is a decent way to break the ice in circles where status and attainment matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if regular bragging is blowing one’s own horn, Outsourced “Bragging” is, ehm, blowing someone else’s horn on their behalf. The holy grail of status establishment is when it’s already done for you, when your reputation literally precedes you — Proverbs 27:2 “Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips.” Such luxuries aren’t just the sole reserve of the celebrated and famous — the same mechanisms are at play in small-scale ways in our day-to-day lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earlier example is formal and civilized, but the same workings takes place, much less tastefully but hardly less effectively, amongst “bros”. At college I knew an inveterate party-goer Joseph, henceforth Broseph. Whenever Broseph’s gang would meet new people — especially ones they wanted to sleep with, which was roughly anyone with a pulse — Broseph would proclaim something massively hyperbolic about one of his own: “This guys’s a facking musical genius! You gotta hear him play.” More often than you might expect, these effusions would intrigue the new arrivals enough to stick around, all the while steering the conversation to places where the gang might shine. It wasn’t clear whether Broseph’s group explicitly coordinated these Outsourced Brags or whether they were tacitly arranged; all I know is that they cropped up with the regular inevitability of IRS late-filing fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you’ll have noticed, I’ve been writing Outsourced “Brag” instead of Outsourced Brag. When someone sings praises on your behalf, it doesn’t seem right to label this as bragging since it is missing the &lt;em&gt;self-directed&lt;/em&gt; element of status imposition. This remains true whether the delivery of praise was coordinated or not. Note, however, that this boundary becomes more difficult to locate when you start considering the possibility of Reflected Glory Brags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect that Broseph, who we first met in the section on Outsourced “Brags”, had a hidden agenda in bigging up his friends. That agenda was narcissism. Broseph fancied himself a member of an elite social milieu, à la Hemingway in 1920s Paris or Feynman in 1940s Los Alamos. In constantly bragging about his friends’ abilities, Broseph was actually bragging about himself, the brag assuming the following logic: “I hang out with great people. Ergo, by virtue of their wishing to keep company with me, I too am great.” Reflected Glory Brags, then, are all about greatness by association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The principal says my little angel is the most beloved boy in school!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflected Glory Brags are especially common with a particular brand of proud parent, one for whom achievement is vicariously experienced through their young. “My daughter is so bored at school; even though she’s only in the first grade she reads at a grade 5 level already. And she can count to four in Japanese” (and we only had to drill her 400 hours a day!) “You should see my son’s Facebook photos — quite the lady killer” (kid looks like a “lady killer” alright — but not in a good way).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulatory Brags are often combined with Reflected Glory Brags. My friend’s aunt-in-law posts a great many congratulatory photo messages on social media, all of which share a particular feature: her, standing side-by-side with the applauded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Betty had recently been promoted to a glamorous, jet-setting executive position at a major corporation. We met to catch up, and we talked about her time in this and that city. She mentioned a conference in Rio and I asked if she would attend. “Dunno. I checked my expense account for the first time yesterday and saw that I’d racked up $25,000 in the last month. I might need to tone it down…” Listening to Betty’s statement, I had the impression that it was no accident that she’d chosen to say “$25,000” instead of the more self-effacing formulation “too much”, i.e. she did not choose to take the Lesser of Two Brags. Aside from that, how did she burn through so much money — was I missing out a corporate craze of employing iPads as disposable mosquito swatters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most people’s view of what counts as bragging, an exemption is granted to status-elevating information that emerges naturally, e.g. in response to a direct question or as necessary background for a story (see Narrative Brag). In such cases the status wasn’t imposed by the speaker, so its communication is viewed as being perfectly in order. The Gratuitous Detail Brag exploits this exemption by slipping in an unnecessary detail at the right moment. By inhabiting this gray zone, the Gratuitous Detail Brag has some measure of plausible deniability, and indeed it’s often difficult to tell whether the speaker intended to brag at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this photo is exclusively about sweatpants then? Absolutely nada to do with that outrageously lush car lurking in the background and screaming success? Besides, I thought you cycled to yoga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To pull off a Prop Brag, you need to engineer things so that your material possessions, physical environment, or general situation does the bragging for you. The brag’s defining feature is that it’s non-verbal. And because props are more difficult to fake than words, the brag becomes more credible. Last but not least, Prop Brags have strong plausible deniability: If you are rich, you’ll have a swish apartment. End of. No-one expects you to jump through hoops to hide this fact of your existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, I suspect that an acquaintance of mine distributes printouts of bank statements with zeroes in all the right places around his apartment before guests arrive. I don’t have proof that this was ever done intentionally; all I know is that he is otherwise a neat freak, and it seems out of character for him to leave documents scattered about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prop Bragging can be extended to much human behavior if you feel so inclined: Why do people wear Rolex watches, buy Porsches, or otherwise engage in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspicuous_consumption&quot;&gt;conspicuous acts of consumption&lt;/a&gt;? Why does that guy — who is constantly looking around to see who is watching — write classical music in a coffee shop instead of at home — and with manuscript and quill instead of software?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a similarity between Prop Bragging and Showmanship Bragging, in the sense that you could consider the prop to be the artifact of a previous action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BragFM Brags differ from standard brags in that they are imposed on strangers in the vicinity instead of people already in a dialogue with the braggart. This is achieved via methods such as needlessly loud phone calls: “I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt;! It was UNBELIEVABLY great how Sting just showed up to our wedding like that”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BragFM Brag doesn’t necessarily require a phone; it can be accomplished just as easily with a complicit friend — simply rehash your best-ofs with the volume turned up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A BragFM Brag must be imposed on the audience, so typically it occurs in enclosed spaces where people tend to stick around for a while, such as train compartments, small bars, saunas etc. In more transient settings, the braggart’s efforts would be wasted because those within earshot would be free to vacate the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BragFM Brag could be viewed as a strange conversation starter. I’ve sometimes had the impression that this brag was employed by shy people who wanted to raise their status enough to entice those around them to say hello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this note, a related social phenomena that doesn’t fall neatly into the domain of bragging but is nevertheless interesting is how groups of singles, hoping to attract the attention of suitable mates nearby, awkwardly push themselves to project an overall air of merriment and fun &lt;a href=&quot;https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/secretly-hate-bars.html&quot;&gt;beyond that of what they’re actually experiencing&lt;/a&gt; — except in Ireland where the men in the pubs mostly project an “air” of Guinness and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast/_roll&quot;&gt;breakfast rolls&lt;/a&gt;. These singles amplify everything about themselves, laughing at triple their usual volume, exaggerating their bodily movements beyond what’s usual, and overall desperately seeking to be exemplars of the myth that being in a loud, crowded, over-priced bar is anything other than odious. Even if it breaks them, even if it costs them everything they hold dear in the world, they shall win at having a good a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the Race to the Bottom Brag is to seek status by winning at losing. “I failed the math test so hard, hurrrrr”. This mode of bragging is often combined with Oneupmanship Brags (or more technically Onedownmanship Brags), as we saw in the video above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to be careful to tease apart a couple of superficially similar behaviors when thinking about Race to the Bottom Brags. Bragging about how you were so drunk that you were pronounced dead, is usually a proxy for bragging about how C-R-A-Z-Y or fun-loving or hardy you are. That’s just regular bragging with a screwy conception of what affords status. As well as that, what might first appear to be a Race to the Bottom Brag might actually be a touch of self-deprecating humor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: “What’s your job like?”&lt;br/&gt;Honeypot: “It’s a slog. But once in a while I pamper myself as a reward.”&lt;br/&gt;Me: (falling for the curiosity trap): “How do you do that?”&lt;br/&gt;Honeypot: *&lt;em&gt;pulls out Lamborghini keys like it isn’t a big deal&lt;/em&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Honeypot Brag is likely the most Machiavellian one listed here. It consists of luring your conversation partner into asking a question, the answer to which raises your status. Since answering a direct question is rarely perceived as bragging, the Honeypot Braggart will appear humble so long as their tracks are well covered and no-one suspects a setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for a more down-to-earth example, consider the situation where someone poses a question for everyone in the group but is visibly bursting to answer for themselves and you know they couldn’t care less about anyone else’s response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honeypot: “OK everyone — what’s the craziest place you had sex in public?”&lt;br/&gt;Everyone else: …&lt;br/&gt;Honeypot: “MY TURN. Well &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; once had sex behind a garbage can in Grand Central Station. How bad am I!”&lt;br/&gt;Everyone else: “That’s just foul…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;15-narrative-brag&quot;&gt;15. Narrative Brag&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/ScreenShot2018-09-20at161724.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a business setting, I was introduced to a young star who I’ll call Orion. In response to the question, “tell us about yourself,” a lesser man would have blurted out, “I did three rock-hard degrees in the sciences — simultaneously, started a video game company immediately afterwards, then sold it for $$$. You?” But Orion didn’t do this, and this was merciful because such a deluge of impressiveness would have made me feel like a cockroach caught tampering with a kiwi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead Orion told me a story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I lived in the country-side and was super bored all the time so I started programming at 11, and because I was really into video games, I started fiddling with game engines. I took that passion to university by studying computer science, but, considering that I’d been programming for years already, the course didn’t demand much of my time, so I took up math and physics as joint degrees, which turned out to be pretty painful actually but I managed by being strategic about choosing overlapping modules. While studying, I met my business partner, and we spent our last year programming our first startup, which went bankrupt. We learned our lessons and tried again — hitting the luck jackpot on our third attempt when we got our software featured in the App store, leading to a million downloads.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Narrative Brag converts what would otherwise be a monstrous amount of brag into a relatable narrative, one person’s personal hero’s journey. It’s quite graceful. By showing the human effort and struggle that goes into the attainment of status, the Narrative Brag has the effect of communicating success while at the same time neutralizing the sting. This was one of the cases where I was riveted by a brag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I recall a friend, Brennan, telling me that he had lunch with “the most powerful woman he’d met in his life (bomb hatch opens; gears are heard): &amp;lt;MASSIVE NAMEDROP&amp;gt;”. But instead of pausing to allow the impact of the namedrop to take its toll, he spoke about how it felt to be in the presence of someone with so much power and cachet, raising his eyebrows wide in astonishment and then looking to the floor in what, barring a stellar acting performance, seemed to be genuine humility. This was primarily a story about how he felt; &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; he had met was merely background detail, it would seem. Also, think about this: Someone determined to prove that they are better than me would taken the bigger brag of “… and meeting people like &amp;lt;MASSIVE NAMEDROP&amp;gt; is just my day-to-day, ya know?” By not taking that clichéd route, Brennan made himself more relatable. At the very least, he did the noble thing and took the Lesser of Two Brags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For another perspective on Narrative Brags, let’s turn to an example from Paul Graham’s classic essay &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/nerds.html&quot;&gt;Why Nerds Are Unpopular&lt;/a&gt;. He writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stock gradually rose during high school. Puberty finally arrived; I became a decent soccer player; I started a scandalous underground newspaper. So I’ve seen a good part of the popularity landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PG tells us that he eventually became popular at school. Is this a micro brag to rescue his ego from the preceding admission of being uncool? It wouldn’t seem so, since PG satisfactorily justifies why he included those details: “I’ve seen a good part of the popularity landscape”. But herein lies the bragging potential: Someone determined enough, who was willing to do the gymnastics, could contrive a series of stories that demonstrate their status, yet still enjoy plausible deniability because the status-evoking factoids become “necessary details” in the telling of the stories. Ramping up this idea to 10000% are certain members of the Pick Up Artist (PUA) community who prepare &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pickupguide.com/maniacpl.htm&quot;&gt;scores of narratives in frameworks&lt;/a&gt;, each one &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pickupguide.com/mpexpl.htm&quot;&gt;demonstrating to their dates something universally admirable&lt;/a&gt;, like adventurousness (escaping from bears), bravery (unaided rock climbing), and financial savvy (early Bitcoin “investor”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t be surprised if they also prepared a story for spontaneity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember being out at a restaurant with a group of salesmen and one of them noticed his phone vibrating, pulled it out, then shouted, mostly to himself, “fuck yea, another sale”. I found myself cheering for him too. But if he’d told me twelve hours later “I made 10 sales today. I am Aerosmith”, I would have scoffed. Somehow, the fact that he erupted with good feeling and couldn’t quite help but brag makes it all the more acceptable, compared say to a more calculated boast that wasn’t prompted by new information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Moved by the Moment Brag can be likened to the legal defense of “crime of passion” (aka provocation) in murder cases, where the guilty receives a reduced conviction because their crime occurred in the heat of the moment, for example in response to walking in on their partner cheating or, worse again, opening up an Instagram account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I see photos on Facebook of friends savoring an important moment, like signing a book contract, finishing a PhD, or winning a jam-eating contest. Are these people bragging? It’s hard to say. It’s very possible that their only motivation is to keep friends and family informed. On the other hand, why not discretely message the twenty people who care instead of blasting it out to 1200 followers? Ultimately these shares don’t really sting. Sometimes the original poster’s joy even spills out from the photo and infects you, at least where you don’t have some unsettled beef with them (e.g. if your dreams of being a jam-eating champion were cruelly dashed ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sam constantly jokes about being physically intimidating. Whenever we walk past a muscle-bound fellow who steps out of the way because he’s a normal, non-scummy human being, Sam quips, “that’s &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; you do” or “he knows who’s boss”. Although Sam is (I hope) being silly, I can’t help but consider him that bit more intimidating than if he’d said nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Not-Sure-If-Joking Brag works by exaggerating the message so much that it’s relegated to that no-man’s land where you can’t quite tell if it was meant seriously or not. (Incidentally my favorite people in the world seem to be permanently stuck in this land.) It has advantage of deflecting any accusations of bragging since “obviously” it was a joke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;iv-brag-gags-avoiding-bragging-at-all-costs&quot;&gt;IV Brag Gags: Avoiding Bragging At All Costs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my quest to catch every brag known to man, I discovered that there is class of person who does everything in their power to avoid signaling status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recall a frustrating exchange with a man I’ll call Mitchell. Throughout our first and only conversation, he gave ridiculously indirect answers to my info-soliciting questions. Indeed he would even go so far as to feign not hearing me. Here’s a characteristic exchange:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: “So Mitchell, where did you go to university?”&lt;br/&gt;Mitchell: “In England”, he replied in an accent so posh it would humble the Queen.&lt;br/&gt;Me: “Yes, that much is apparent. I meant where in particular?”&lt;br/&gt;Mitchell: “…”&lt;br/&gt;Me: “You must not have heard me — where’d you study?”&lt;br/&gt;To which Mitchell didn’t respond, instead switching the topic of conversation.&lt;br/&gt;Me: *&lt;em&gt;grabbing Mitchell by the collar and shaking him&lt;/em&gt;* “WHERE DID YOU GO TO UNIVERSITY ASSHOLE?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/brag-gag.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitchell’s verbal shiftiness had the inevitable effect of arousing my curiosity, so I looked him up on LinkedIn in the bathroom and, as expected, he was an Oxford boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us assume that Mitchell’s behavior was motivated by the noble intention to avoid giving others status anxiety. Assuming this is true, I still can’t help thinking that he regards his pedigree to such a high extent that he thinks its revelation would cause people who attended “merely normal” universities to feel like his lessers. That’s a rather presumptuous world-view, one I’m not terribly excited about inferring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, even if you grant him these presumptions, I still don’t think he’s going about this goal of hiding status in an effective manner. His omissions cause such a jarring interruption to the normal flow of conversation that they amplify whatever he wishes to hide. It’s easy to imagine more graceful alternatives, like a self-deprecating addendum (“Oxford — if anyone tells you bribing admissions doesn’t work, they are woefully misinformed”) or by deflecting with a joke instead of ignoring the question (“Clown college — and it took me seven years to graduate because I kept flunking Unicycles”). Owing to his odd way of avoiding bragging, I was soon desperate to Ditchell Mr. Mitchell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;v-why-do-people-brag&quot;&gt;V Why Do People Brag?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigating why it is that people brag brings us into speculative territory as there hasn’t been an awful lot of research into this topic. As such I am going to wheel out the armchair psychologist and dust off his little spectacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;driver-1-feeling-small&quot;&gt;Driver 1: Feeling small&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/honey.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In movie form: “Honey I Shrunk My Ego”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I looked back over all my observations, I couldn’t help noticing a few tendencies. Firstly, many of the brags were uttered by people with somewhat nervous temperaments. Sometimes I could sense an unease about them. Other times I was privy to background information, such as a history of mental illness. Secondly, bragging tended to happen with younger people, who generally have lower status in the ranks of society and a stronger need to prove themselves. Thirdly, bragging was concentrated in initial getting-to-know-you interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking all of these tendencies together, it’s clear that a major driver for bragging is when the speaker feels they need to make a strong impression but also believes that their personal presentation, without the expected boost from bragging, will be insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drilling deeper, what causes the speaker to feel such a boost is necessary in the first place? A simple answer might be that low self-esteem is the ultimate cause — an unjustified feeling that you aren’t good enough. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/me-you-us/201410/do-you-need-everyone-know-your-status&quot;&gt;Studies about what causes people to over-share their relationship on social media&lt;/a&gt; (e.g. #blessed) bear out this hypothesis, showing that those with attachment anxiety are most likely to have what researchers call “high relationship visibility” and what everyone else calls “annoyingly many couple photos”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, is the following situation familiar to you? Say two people are speaking and one is significantly more successful than the other in a dimension where the other happens to be anxious about (e.g. the outward success of money). Here the second person’s ego may start feeling threatened. This, in turn, creates an urge to either falsify information in the aggrieved dimension (Bullshit Brag) or to import status from a separate dimension where they feel more competitive (e.g. to flaunt a presumed special power, like musicianship or intelligence or mutant Cyclops eyes — giving rise to Out-Of-Nowhere Brags). Overall, the dynamic is that the insecure person attempts to address their wounds by convincing the other person that they are worthy – even though such a communication was neither necessary nor asked for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;driver-2-self-promotion&quot;&gt;Driver 2: Self promotion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Vice President of the United States John Nance Garner said, “You have to do a little bragging on yourself even to your relatives — man doesn’t get anywhere without advertising.” The sentiment in this quote rings even truer today, as President Trump could certainly be said to have done “a little” bragging:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/trump.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“In less than two years, my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know someone who moderates conferences for a living. After every event, he posts a picture onto Facebook of the audience — from the perspective of the stage looking outwards — and thanks the crowd in a fawning manner. Although it’s clearly showy (and an example of a Congratulatory Brag), I’m fairly confident that his self-promotion is good for business and helps him net future gigs. Similarly, in my day job, I sometimes go on business lunches with people I don’t know. There is always a certain amount of bragging to these affairs, since both me and my lunch companion know the point is to communicate our value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This driver then is all about cost-benefit analysis — I know I might risk pissing off my listeners by bragging, but, at least if I’m credible, I might stand out and have a better chance of getting what I want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;driver-3-fear-of-abandonment&quot;&gt;Driver 3: Fear of abandonment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another driver for braggarts is something that at first seems like a superiority complex but in fact is something deeper. The archetype I have in mind is the guy who only seems to feel whole once he has convinced everyone in the room that he is a deity of supernatural success and powers. His self-esteem depends, in its entirety, on others buying into and holding these views – i.e. it is in no way possible for such braggarts to feel quietly confident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a friend of this variety in the past. He would spend every second sentence aggrandizing himself and every first one merely talking about himself. After a while, I began to see through his bluster and realized that he didn’t really view himself as better than everyone else, but rather his social anxiety, when coupled with a relentlessly elitist world view, caused him to think that he would be socially abandoned unless he could prove that he was in the upper echelons of everything. Perversely, many of his friends abandoned him exactly because of this constant communication of status. I was one of them, and I sometimes feel guilty about this. But it’s really tough being around someone who is insatiably needy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;driver-4-dopamine-kick-from-sharing&quot;&gt;Driver 4: Dopamine kick from sharing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/PastedGraphic.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another common driver for bragging is the emotional kick we get from self-disclosure. Diana I. Tamir and Jason P. Mitchell showed in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/109/21/8038&quot;&gt;2012 study&lt;/a&gt; that individuals were willing to forgo money for the opportunity to disclose information about themselves. Given such a powerful urge for self-disclosure, it should come as no surprise that people may impose their status on others even though a voice in the back of their head might warn that it is socially ill-advised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this light, I’ve come to realize that certain behaviors that might seem like Oneupmanship Bragging might actually be driven by a simple compulsion to share. For example, if I talk about climbing a mountain and you mention that you climbed one which happened to be higher, this could very plausibly be motivated by your desire to contribute to a conversation about climbing, not to prove that you’re better at mountains than I am. It’s the generative emotion that counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;driver-5-lack-of-social-awareness&quot;&gt;Driver 5: Lack of social awareness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/abed1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us were fortunate enough to be brought up by loving parents who celebrated our every creative act, no matter how mundane, no matter how minor. To these parents, even a productive potty session is cause for jubilation. It is only when we are older that we realize that not everyone is as excited for our “successes” as mommy and daddy were. But we don’t all have this realization at the same time, with some late developers continuing bragging to all and sundry well into their 20s, 30s, and 40s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;driver-6-aggression&quot;&gt;Driver 6: Aggression&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/madmax.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are people out there who are obsessed with dominance and who relish belittling others. Thankfully these types are not so common, but it would be naive to think that bragging is exclusively motivated by the gentler emotional drivers above. I have certainly been in situations where braggarts fully intended for their status to cut me. Even if their aggression derives from a place of inner pain, I can’t summon much sympathy for these sadists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;vi-conclusion&quot;&gt;VI Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers of the first draft of this piece were fiercely concerned with what my definition of bragging encompassed, especially when it risked labelling some acts of their own as bragging. For example, my girlfriend worried about whether showing her friends a video of her doing a pull-up was a brag. Her worry arises from the fact that social opprobrium is often attached to bragging, and no-one wants this opprobrium to extend to themselves. So for her and the other early readers, their real question was really about whether there is a social norm against certain behaviors, about whether they will be judged immodest or impolite and consequently liked less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the vague feeling my girlfriend won’t be getting burned at the stake over her pull-up video. For one, pull-up ability is a fairly frivolous kind of status and I can’t imagine someone feeling too raw about being outdone in this department. But what if she wanted to share something more classically impressive, like a new holiday home? Generally speaking, learning of another person’s success often inflicts jealousy. Yes, in some loving relationships, this valence is flipped, but not as often as you’d think. Even though siblings are bound by blood and have known each other their entire lives, — plus a few more if they’re into reincarnation — sibling envy can reach &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cain-biblical-figure&quot;&gt;biblical proportions&lt;/a&gt;. Granted, there may be some enlightened individuals who don’t ever feel this way, but they are the exception, hardly the rule. So at the very least, even if my girlfriend had no intention to provoke envy by sharing something impressive, the revelation of differences in status would probably have this effect anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/joan.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about the alternative of completely avoiding any comments that reveal status? Unfortunately that’s not how the world works. To start with, people love to share — it’s part of how conversation works. Moreover, some status is impossible not to communicate — try hiding a yacht. Furthermore, there are many milieus, especially business and dating after 30, where tasteful communication of status is positively helpful — otherwise you risk getting glossed over in favor of a more boastful candidate. Don’t misunderstand my point: I am far from thrilled that we live in a society where status matters. But it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s zoom out here. When people disapprove of bragging it isn’t because they feel envious of revealed status differences — the pain arising from that is independent. The real reason people disapprove of bragging is because they have the impression that you are not driven by the need to share, but rather by a desire to elevate yourself. In other words, people have a basic resistance to self-directed claims to grandeur. But before their opprobrium applies, questions of culpability must first be resolved — was the brag intended or was it merely an accidental side-effect of something more socially acceptable? And here we get to the core of why so many people cloak their brags in a mask of plausible deniability: It shields them from disapproval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quintessential disliked braggart is one who doesn’t only impose their status but also appears to stomp on yours. There is a very real difference between learning that a friend earns 10x what you do and them browbeating you with it. In the latter case, you get the impression (probably from said beating of brow) that the speaker considers themselves superior to you, and it isn’t pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/stomp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly how I felt when I originally met Dr. Feel Good, that braggart from the opening of the piece who claimed he had learned German in three weeks, at bars no less. But as I thought about the experience again, after my journey into bragging, I realized that something didn’t add up: If this guy really considered himself better than me, then why had he tried so hard to impress? Maybe I had made a mistake. Maybe he didn’t see really himself as superior, but rather as inferior. Maybe he believed that without communicating his status, he wouldn’t be worthy of my or any other person’s affections, that without being impressive he could never be liked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I somehow got the chance to test this theory, as I bumped into Dr. Feel Good at a conference last month. True to form, he launched into telling me how successful his latest business venture had become and how he had the choice of clients. All without my asking him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His claims weren’t particularly credible, but I realized something: that wasn’t the point. The point was that he wanted approval. So that I gave him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s really impressive!” I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And his face lit up.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What Businessweek got wrong about Apple</title>
<link>https://www.apple.com/au/newsroom/2018/10/what-businessweek-got-wrong-about-apple/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.apple.com/au/newsroom/2018/10/what-businessweek-got-wrong-about-apple/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the past year, Bloomberg has contacted us multiple times with claims, sometimes vague and sometimes elaborate, of an alleged security incident at Apple. Each time, we have conducted rigorous internal investigations based on their inquiries and each time we have found absolutely no evidence to support any of them. We have repeatedly and consistently offered factual responses, on the record, refuting virtually every aspect of Bloomberg’s story relating to Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this we can be very clear: Apple has never found malicious chips, “hardware manipulations” or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server. Apple never had any contact with the FBI or any other agency about such an incident. We are not aware of any investigation by the FBI, nor are our contacts in law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to Bloomberg’s latest version of the narrative, we present the following facts: Siri and Topsy never shared servers; Siri has never been deployed on servers sold to us by Super Micro; and Topsy data was limited to approximately 2,000 Super Micro servers, not 7,000. None of those servers have ever been found to hold malicious chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a matter of practice, before servers are put into production at Apple they are inspected for security vulnerabilities and we update all firmware and software with the latest protections. We did not uncover any unusual vulnerabilities in the servers we purchased from Super Micro when we updated the firmware and software according to our standard procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are deeply disappointed that in their dealings with us, Bloomberg’s reporters have not been open to the possibility that they or their sources might be wrong or misinformed. Our best guess is that they are confusing their story with a previously-reported 2016 incident in which we discovered an infected driver on a single Super Micro server in one of our labs. That one-time event was determined to be accidental and not a targeted attack against Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there has been no claim that customer data was involved, we take these allegations seriously and we want users to know that we do everything possible to safeguard the personal information they entrust to us. We also want them to know that what Bloomberg is reporting about Apple is inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has always believed in being transparent about the ways we handle and protect data. If there were ever such an event as Bloomberg News has claimed, we would be forthcoming about it and we would work closely with law enforcement. Apple engineers conduct regular and rigorous security screenings to ensure that our systems are safe. We know that security is an endless race and that’s why we constantly fortify our systems against increasingly sophisticated hackers and cybercriminals who want to steal our data.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;h2 name=&quot;c551&quot; id=&quot;c551&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3 graf--subtitle&quot;&gt;A beginner’s guide to understanding the inner workings of Deep Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;304b&quot; id=&quot;304b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Motivation:&lt;/strong&gt; As part of my personal journey to gain a better understanding of Deep Learning, I’ve decided to build a Neural Network from scratch without a deep learning library like TensorFlow. I believe that understanding the inner workings of a Neural Network is important to any aspiring Data Scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fe66&quot; id=&quot;fe66&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This article contains what I’ve learned, and hopefully it’ll be useful for you as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;b6e2&quot; id=&quot;b6e2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What’s a Neural Network?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;166f&quot; id=&quot;166f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Most introductory texts to Neural Networks brings up brain analogies when describing them. Without delving into brain analogies, I find it easier to simply describe Neural Networks as a mathematical function that maps a given input to a desired output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ba8e&quot; id=&quot;ba8e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Neural Networks consist of the following components&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;e787&quot; id=&quot;e787&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;An &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;input layer&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;a482&quot; id=&quot;a482&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;An arbitrary amount of &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;hidden layers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;9d03&quot; id=&quot;9d03&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;An &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;output layer&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;ŷ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;6ba4&quot; id=&quot;6ba4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;A set of &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;weights&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;biases&lt;/strong&gt; between each layer, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;W and b&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;2df1&quot; id=&quot;2df1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;A choice of &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;activation function&lt;/strong&gt; for each hidden layer, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;σ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. In this tutorial, we’ll use a Sigmoid activation function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;43e7&quot; id=&quot;43e7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;The diagram below shows the architecture of a 2-layer Neural Network (&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;note that the input layer is typically excluded when counting the number of layers in a Neural Network&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*sX6T0Y4aa3ARh7IBS_sdqw.png&quot; data-width=&quot;500&quot; data-height=&quot;460&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*sX6T0Y4aa3ARh7IBS_sdqw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Architecture of a 2-layer Neural Network
&lt;p name=&quot;1304&quot; id=&quot;1304&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Creating a Neural Network class in Python is easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;780f&quot; id=&quot;780f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Training the Neural Network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;694c&quot; id=&quot;694c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The output &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;ŷ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of a simple 2-layer Neural Network is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*E1_l8PGamc2xTNS87XGNcA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;355&quot; data-height=&quot;34&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*E1_l8PGamc2xTNS87XGNcA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5894&quot; id=&quot;5894&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;You might notice that in the equation above, the weights &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;W&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and the biases &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are the only variables that affects the output &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;ŷ.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;39d4&quot; id=&quot;39d4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Naturally, the right values for the weights and biases determines the strength of the predictions. The process of fine-tuning the weights and biases from the input data is known as &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;training the Neural Network.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3b47&quot; id=&quot;3b47&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Each iteration of the training process consists of the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;4cbe&quot; id=&quot;4cbe&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Calculating the predicted output &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;ŷ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, known as &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;feedforward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;7124&quot; id=&quot;7124&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Updating the weights and biases, known as &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;backpropagation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;6c26&quot; id=&quot;6c26&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;The sequential graph below illustrates the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*CEtt0h8Rss_qPu7CyqMTdQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;2154&quot; data-height=&quot;352&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*CEtt0h8Rss_qPu7CyqMTdQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*CEtt0h8Rss_qPu7CyqMTdQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;a361&quot; id=&quot;a361&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Feedforward&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d9cb&quot; id=&quot;d9cb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;As we’ve seen in the sequential graph above, feedforward is just simple calculus and for a basic 2-layer neural network, the output of the Neural Network is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*E1_l8PGamc2xTNS87XGNcA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;355&quot; data-height=&quot;34&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*E1_l8PGamc2xTNS87XGNcA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ebcb&quot; id=&quot;ebcb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Let’s add a feedforward function in our python code to do exactly that. Note that for simplicity, we have assumed the biases to be 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;08d0&quot; id=&quot;08d0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;However, we still need a way to evaluate the “goodness” of our predictions (i.e. how far off are our predictions)? The &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Loss Function&lt;/strong&gt; allows us to do exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;6dcc&quot; id=&quot;6dcc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Loss Function&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;30eb&quot; id=&quot;30eb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;There are many available loss functions, and the nature of our problem should dictate our choice of loss function. In this tutorial, we’ll use a simple &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;sum-of-sqaures error&lt;/strong&gt; as our loss function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*iNa1VLdaeqwUAxpNXs3jwQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;300&quot; data-height=&quot;60&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*iNa1VLdaeqwUAxpNXs3jwQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;56ff&quot; id=&quot;56ff&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;That is, the sum-of-squares error is simply the sum of the difference between each predicted value and the actual value. The difference is squared so that we measure the absolute value of the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3f37&quot; id=&quot;3f37&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Our goal in training is to find the best set of weights and biases that minimizes the loss function.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;afa4&quot; id=&quot;afa4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Backpropagation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4bf7&quot; id=&quot;4bf7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Now that we’ve measured the error of our prediction (loss), we need to find a way to &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;propagate&lt;/strong&gt; the error back, and to update our weights and biases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3e4d&quot; id=&quot;3e4d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In order to know the appropriate amount to adjust the weights and biases by, we need to know the &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;derivative of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;369e&quot; id=&quot;369e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Recall from calculus that the derivative of a function is simply the slope of the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*3FgDOt4kJxK2QZlb9T0cpg.png&quot; data-width=&quot;700&quot; data-height=&quot;398&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*3FgDOt4kJxK2QZlb9T0cpg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Gradient descent algorithm
&lt;p name=&quot;a459&quot; id=&quot;a459&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;If we have the derivative, we can simply update the weights and biases by increasing/reducing with it(refer to the diagram above). This is known as &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;gradient descent&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;febd&quot; id=&quot;febd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;However, we can’t directly calculate the derivative of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases because the equation of the loss function does not contain the weights and biases. Therefore, we need the &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;chain rule&lt;/strong&gt; to help us calculate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*7zxb2lfWWKaVxnmq2o69Mw.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1192&quot; data-height=&quot;534&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*7zxb2lfWWKaVxnmq2o69Mw.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*7zxb2lfWWKaVxnmq2o69Mw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Chain rule for calculating derivative of the loss function with respect to the weights. Note that for simplicity, we have only displayed the partial derivative assuming a 1-layer Neural Network.
&lt;p name=&quot;603d&quot; id=&quot;603d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Phew! That was ugly but it allows us to get what we needed — the derivative (slope) of the loss function with respect to the weights, so that we can adjust the weights accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6d1c&quot; id=&quot;6d1c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Now that we have that, let’s add the backpropagation function into our python code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;0455&quot; id=&quot;0455&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;For a deeper understanding of the application of calculus and the chain rule in backpropagation, I strongly recommend this tutorial by 3Blue1Brown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 name=&quot;71b3&quot; id=&quot;71b3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Putting it all together&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7505&quot; id=&quot;7505&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Now that we have our complete python code for doing feedforward and backpropagation, let’s apply our Neural Network on an example and see how well it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*HaC4iILh2t0oOKi6S6FwtA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;400&quot; data-height=&quot;146&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*HaC4iILh2t0oOKi6S6FwtA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;dd34&quot; id=&quot;dd34&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Our Neural Network should learn the ideal set of weights to represent this function. Note that it isn’t exactly trivial for us to work out the weights just by inspection alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d0c1&quot; id=&quot;d0c1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Let’s train the Neural Network for 1500 iterations and see what happens. Looking at the loss per iteration graph below, we can clearly see the loss &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;monotonically decreasing towards a minimum.&lt;/strong&gt; This is consistent with the gradient descent algorithm that we’ve discussed earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*fWNNA2YbsLSoA104K3Z3RA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;498&quot; data-height=&quot;267&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*fWNNA2YbsLSoA104K3Z3RA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7f8c&quot; id=&quot;7f8c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Let’s look at the final prediction (output) from the Neural Network after 1500 iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*9oOlYhhOSdCUqUJ0dQ_KxA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;177&quot; data-height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*9oOlYhhOSdCUqUJ0dQ_KxA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Predictions after 1500 training iterations
&lt;p name=&quot;783c&quot; id=&quot;783c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;We did it! Our feedforward and backpropagation algorithm trained the Neural Network successfully and the predictions converged on the true values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0eb6&quot; id=&quot;0eb6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Note that there’s a slight difference between the predictions and the actual values. This is desirable, as it prevents &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;overfitting&lt;/strong&gt; and allows the Neural Network to &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;generalize&lt;/strong&gt; better to unseen data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;923b&quot; id=&quot;923b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What’s Next?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4b7e&quot; id=&quot;4b7e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Fortunately for us, our journey isn’t over. There’s still &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;much&lt;/strong&gt; to learn about Neural Networks and Deep Learning. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;62c5&quot; id=&quot;62c5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What other &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;activation function&lt;/strong&gt; can we use besides the Sigmoid function?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;f888&quot; id=&quot;f888&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Using a &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;learning rate&lt;/strong&gt; when training the Neural Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;e302&quot; id=&quot;e302&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Using &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;convolutions&lt;/strong&gt; for image classification tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;dafb&quot; id=&quot;dafb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;I’ll be writing more on these topics soon, so do follow me on Medium and keep and eye out for them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;e537&quot; id=&quot;e537&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ce81&quot; id=&quot;ce81&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;I’ve certainly learnt a lot writing my own Neural Network from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6a38&quot; id=&quot;6a38&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Although Deep Learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras makes it easy to build deep nets without fully understanding the inner workings of a Neural Network, I find that it’s beneficial for aspiring data scientist to gain a deeper understanding of Neural Networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3dc7&quot; id=&quot;3dc7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;This exercise has been a great investment of my time, and I hope that it’ll be useful for you as well!&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.github.com/2018-10-04-announcing-the-new-github-and-jira-software-cloud-integration/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11401067/46238614-bf53d400-c342-11e8-8612-03e869020e60.png&quot; alt=&quot;jira-github&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to us that our users can work the way they want to. For this reason, we’ve built a new integration with Jira allowing software teams to connect their code on GitHub.com to their projects on Jira Software Cloud. The new app updates Jira with data from GitHub, providing your team with visibility into the status of your work. From planning and coding through deployment and measuring impact—this integration provides a more seamless experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;see-the-details&quot;&gt;See the details&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linking your GitHub account to Jira gives your team the ability to see their branches, commit messages, and pull requests right in the context of the Jira tickets they’re working on. You can also view references to Jira in GitHub issues, and pull requests, allowing for a deeper connection. This means you don’t have to constantly switch between GitHub and Jira.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31524198/46449637-01658700-c742-11e8-89a7-49cc4285603b.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of a Jira issue with pull request details&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;improved-capabilities&quot;&gt;Improved capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new GitHub-managed app provides improved security, and everything—from installation to setup—is now much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the improved integration you can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use smart commits to update the status, leave a comment, or log time without leaving your command line or GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View associated pull requests, commits, and branches from within a Jira ticket&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search for Jira issues based on related GitHub information, such as open pull requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See the status of development work from within Jira projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatically keep your Jira issue up to date while working in GitHub (through workflow triggers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;migration-path-information&quot;&gt;Migration path information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous version of the Jira integration will be deprecated in favor of this new GitHub-maintained integration. When you install the new app, your Jira Issue data will migrate from GitHub. When the migration is complete, the legacy integration (DVCS connector) is disabled automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;open-platform-commitment&quot;&gt;Open platform commitment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integration was built with publicly-available APIs used by other apps in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;. In the next month, you’ll be able to contribute code, submit feature requests or bug reports, and learn more about how the app works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;get-started&quot;&gt;Get started&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/marketplace/jira-software-github&quot;&gt;Install the Jira Software and GitHub app&lt;/a&gt; to connect your GitHub repositories to your Jira instance. Check back for updates on an upcoming enterprise version of the Jira Cloud and GitHub integration.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Apple&amp;#039;s Proprietary Software Locks Kill Independent Repair on New MacBook Pros</title>
<link>https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/yw9qk7/macbook-pro-software-locks-prevent-independent-repair</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/yw9qk7/macbook-pro-software-locks-prevent-independent-repair</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Apple has introduced software locks that will effectively prevent independent and third-party repair on 2018 MacBook Pro computers, according to internal Apple documents obtained by Motherboard. The new system will render the computer “inoperative” unless a proprietary Apple “system configuration” software is run after parts of the system are replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the document, which was distributed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ypkqxw/do-you-know-anything-about-apples-authorized-service-provider-program&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Apple’s Authorized Service Providers&lt;/a&gt; late last month, this policy will apply to all Apple computers with the “T2” security chip, which is present in 2018 MacBook Pros as well as the iMac Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software lock will kick in for any repair which involves replacing a MacBook Pro’s display assembly, logic board, top case (the keyboard, touchpad, and internal housing), and Touch ID board. On iMac Pros, it will kick in if the Logic Board or flash storage are replaced. The computer will only begin functioning again after Apple or a member of one of Apple’s Authorized Service Provider repair program runs diagnostic software called Apple Service Toolkit 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For Macs with the Apple T2 chip, the repair process is not complete for certain parts replacements until the AST 2 System Configuration suite has been run. Failure to perform this step will result in an inoperative system and an incomplete repair,” the document reads. MacRumors &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2018/10/04/t2-macs-must-pass-diagnostics-for-certain-repairs/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported the new policy earlier today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1538692583391-Screen-Shot-2018-10-04-at-60400-PM.png?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1538692583391-Screen-Shot-2018-10-04-at-60400-PM.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate internal training presentation obtained by Motherboard about how to use the diagnostics states that the “Apple Service Toolkit and Apple Service Toolkit 2 are available only to persons working at Apple-authorized service facilities.” This means that it will become impossible for you to repair your new MacBook Pro at home, or for an independent repair provider to repair it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Do you know more about Apple's new repair policy? Are you an Apple Authorized Service Provider or an independent repair professional who will be affected? You can reach the reporter via email at jason.koebler@vice.com or securely on Signal: 347-513-3688.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AST 2 System Configuration suite is a diagnostic software that Apple uses to ensure that the computer is functioning properly. It includes the Mac Resource Inspector, which does a “quick health check of hardware and software,” as well as tools that check the system’s memory, display, power adapters, cooling system, and other aspects of the computer. It functions only if connected to Apple’s Global Service Exchange (GSX), a Cloud-based server that Apple uses to handle repairs and service. It requires a login from Apple to access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1538692703723-Screen-Shot-2018-10-04-at-60849-PM.png?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1538692703723-Screen-Shot-2018-10-04-at-60849-PM.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a repair model that is &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xykkkd/why-american-farmers-are-hacking-their-tractors-with-ukrainian-firmware&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;similar to that used by John Deere&lt;/a&gt; and auto manufacturers, who often prevent owners from repairing their own tractors or cars without specific diagnostic codes or software that allow a replacement part to connect with the rest of the device. Apple took a similar tact with Touch ID on recent iPhones—the Touch ID feature would not work with replacement home buttons until it went through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/9amn5a/this-is-apples-mysterious-iphone-calibration-machine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;so-called “Horizon Machine&lt;/a&gt;,” which Apple uses to re-map a new Touch ID button with the old device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this move goes further than that, effectively preventing most independent repairs on new MacBook Pros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1538692604302-Screen-Shot-2018-10-04-at-60722-PM.png?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1538692604302-Screen-Shot-2018-10-04-at-60722-PM.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s two possible explanations: This is a continued campaign of obsolescence and they want to control the ecosystem and bring all repair into the network they control,” Kyle Wiens, the CEO of iFixit, told me on the phone. “Another is security, but I don’t see a security model that doesn’t trust the owner of the device making much sense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, 19 states are considering so-called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qvajpv/michigan-teen-right-to-repair&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Right to Repair&lt;/a&gt;” legislation that would require device manufacturers to make repair parts, tools, repair guides, and diagnostic software available to the public. Apple is fighting this legislation; public records show that Apple is lobbying against the bill in New York, where lobbying records must be disclosed to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wiens said that, currently, there is a thriving independent market for MacBook repair, and that this move fundamentally threatens many small businesses and, down the line, may impact school districts, which often have to repair computers used in classrooms at scale. Not everyone lives near an Apple Store or authorized service provider, so it may also make repair much less accessible for people living in underserved areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a portion of the ecosystem that has been very healthy. Independent repair companies have been fixing MacBooks undaunted by the user-hostile activities Apple has taken,” Wiens said. “It could be really detrimental to schools, to people who live in rural areas. If they stick with this, it seems like a huge argument in favor of right to repair.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How solid is Tim’s plan to redecentralize the web?</title>
<link>https://medium.com/@shevski/how-solid-is-tims-plan-to-redecentralize-the-web-b163ba78e835</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://medium.com/@shevski/how-solid-is-tims-plan-to-redecentralize-the-web-b163ba78e835</guid>
<description>&lt;p name=&quot;a9f4&quot; id=&quot;a9f4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;The internet and near-costless scaling of digital has allowed the concentration of too much power in too few hands. Our systems for accountability can’t or won’t keep up. By building alternatives, the decentralisation of networks, governance and control are a promising antidote. That’s why it’s exciting to see web inventor Tim Berners-Lee &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inrupt.com/blog/one-small-step-for-the-web&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.inrupt.com/blog/one-small-step-for-the-web&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announce a commercial venture&lt;/a&gt; to support the Solid platform. &lt;a href=&quot;https://solid.mit.edu/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://solid.mit.edu/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Solid&lt;/a&gt; is a W3C endorsed linked data personal data store (PDS) that puts control into the hands of the user, and Inrupt is the first commercial offer to build on it. When we started &lt;a href=&quot;https://redecentralize.org/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://redecentralize.org/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Redecentralize&lt;/a&gt; in 2013, there were a few people who really cared about decentralisation, and a lot of people who really didn’t care at all. Tim’s backing and endorsement has helped change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;33f6&quot; id=&quot;33f6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;However, I’m concerned Solid is ill-equipped to tackle the challenges of the data ownership space and deliver impact. This article explores some of the problems PDSs face and suggests we need a strategic approach that’s user centered, systemic and allows for a diversity of approaches to overcome centralisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;906b&quot; id=&quot;906b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Can we sell privacy?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bce2&quot; id=&quot;bce2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;The scandals over Cambridge Analytica’s abuse of Facebook’s app privileges, and the implications in terms of political influence and the spread of disinformation, has led to a significant rise in interest in the decentralised web. People increasingly distrust Facebook which shares your phone number with advertisers to target ads and Google which tracks your location even when tracking is explicitly disabled. More recently, the unwitting exposure of at least fifty million Facebook profiles to the prying eyes of random hackers will only increase the pressure on companies to demonstrate that they can be safe custodians of personal data. So earlier this year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@shevski/are-personal-data-stores-about-to-become-the-next-big-thing-b767295ed842&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@shevski/are-personal-data-stores-about-to-become-the-next-big-thing-b767295ed842&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;myself and Simon decided to explore the personal data store space&lt;/a&gt; to assess the effectiveness of the approach Solid takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;5f68&quot; id=&quot;5f68&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;How does a Personal Data Store work?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5534&quot; id=&quot;5534&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Solid’s model is typical of a lot of the PDSs we looked at. User data lives in a datastore. The user either self hosts, or pays for someone to securely host a PDS on their behalf. Applications read/write to that data through user controlled granular permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fd15&quot; id=&quot;fd15&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In the best case scenario of this model, app developers simply provide the interface and functionality of, for example, a calendar or journal app. The data always lives in your datastore. When you browse your journal or calendar in a web or desktop/phone app, the data from your datastore is displayed in the interface, but it’s securely transmitted between you and your datastore. No other parties are able to access it. This would be game changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;c356&quot; id=&quot;c356&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But there are challenges&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;535b&quot; id=&quot;535b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;1. Most digital transactions require verified claims&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c73b&quot; id=&quot;c73b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Much of Tim’s narrative assumes that there is clear ownership of data, which is &lt;a href=&quot;https://theodi.org/article/how-do-we-own-data/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://theodi.org/article/how-do-we-own-data/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;far from straightforward&lt;/a&gt;. Different entities are looking for different kinds of data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;0e61&quot; id=&quot;0e61&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For the majority of digital transactions and interactions (buying things online, applying for services, booking a flight, proving my age), the most valuable data is data asserted about me from an authoritative source. For example, that I have a valid driving license or verified address, bank account, passport.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;9c29&quot; id=&quot;9c29&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;For advertising, it’s what I bought and where I clicked as well as profile data (email address, demographic and interests info). This data is generated by the services I use (e.g. Facebook, Google, Twitter).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;3933&quot; id=&quot;3933&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;For AirBnB and Uber it’s the ratings that other users have given me that’s important, which isn’t data I obviously ‘own’.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;3af6&quot; id=&quot;3af6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Yes, some of this can be self-asserted, but organisations often want objective data based on behaviour and decisions made about us not what we say is true. Mortgage brokers don’t just want my assertion that I have income, they want proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d956&quot; id=&quot;d956&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This means that Solid’s use cases will be limited unless it partners with institutions like banks and governments to assert and verify such data. Luckily there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;standards being developed in the W3C&lt;/a&gt; to facilitate this, but we still need good frameworks and incentives for why such institutions will spend the time/energy to share and verify data about us, how this happens securely and how GDPR requirements are met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;9b2d&quot; id=&quot;9b2d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;2. If we narrow the market, the value proposition is hard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;527e&quot; id=&quot;527e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Putting aside verified claims, we then have the potential market of apps or services which only need self created data, preferences or quantified self data. This could be my calendar, todo list, journal entries, emails, messages, Apple/Google health app stored data, Fitbit data, what websites I use, time spent online, and so on. This is still a major market, but one already well catered for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;e543&quot; id=&quot;e543&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What’s the offer to users?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0b79&quot; id=&quot;0b79&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;I want to see user research that identifies real problems users have with the current status quo which Solid will solve well enough to overcome switching cost and inertia. Most privacy concerns are centered around Facebook — but people are not on Facebook because they lack alternatives. There are numerous well designed, encrypted, decentralised and privacy preserving, even blockchain-based, alternatives. However, your current social network isn’t portable and the value of Facebook and Twitter comes from the people using it. The way we tackle this is to push for &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsocialist.org.uk/do-we-really-need-a-statebook/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://newsocialist.org.uk/do-we-really-need-a-statebook/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;regulation around open protocols&lt;/a&gt;, not by expecting everyone to switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a3c9&quot; id=&quot;a3c9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So if we can’t sell privacy as a product in social media, we need evidence of where else these priorities will bring users. Alternatively, decentralised or PDS-integrated tech must deliver novel and valued functionality or be solving major problems users have with existing centralised solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;2d04&quot; id=&quot;2d04&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What’s the offer to companies and app developers?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9981&quot; id=&quot;9981&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;For companies, service providers and app developers the value proposition is hazy. I have yet to come across a PDS provider with an impressive or long list of partners and companies. Most existing business models depend on controlling the data and using it to improve a service and provide valuable analytics to up-sell paid plans or directly monetise the data collected through advertisers and third party data marketplaces. Giving this up requires incentives or regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ecf1&quot; id=&quot;ecf1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If Solid uptake is big enough to attract app developers, what stops the same data exploitation happening, albeit now with an extra step where the user is asked for ‘permission’ to access and use their data in exchange for a free or better service? Consent is only meaningful if there are genuine alternatives and as an industry we have yet to tackle this problem (see how Facebook, Apple, Google, Amazon ask for ‘consent’). What’s really going on when users are asked to agree to the terms and conditions of software on a phone they’ve already bought that won’t work otherwise? Or agreeing to Facebook’s data selling if there’s no other way for users to invite friends to events, message them or see their photos if those friends are Facebook users? I wouldn’t call this consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;655e&quot; id=&quot;655e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The answer may lie in partnering with civic or NGO organisations that have different incentives, but many users. Organisations like the BBC, governments, local authorities, the charity sector, and even financial organisations like Funding Circle and other peer-to-peer lenders. This is a worthwhile avenue to explore, but it doesn’t feel enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;27d7&quot; id=&quot;27d7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Alternative approaches&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f0f5&quot; id=&quot;f0f5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;It’s time to challenge the standard economic approach when it comes to digital. The economies of scale are fundamentally different and we need bold new frameworks to ensure that technology benefits and protects everyone in society. Governments could and should invest in open infrastructure so that the basics of communicating online or connecting with people, cannot be ‘owned’ by companies, but is a shared basis like the internet or email protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a676&quot; id=&quot;a676&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’m thrilled Tim is pushing forward with Solid, but we need to be thinking bigger. Let’s start tackling the broader challenges and opportunities for a decentralised web to deliver a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@shevski/how-decentralised-are-you-a6539eeb27ff&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@shevski/how-decentralised-are-you-a6539eeb27ff&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;better ecosystem for all&lt;/a&gt;. Solid and similar projects need user research, user centered design, marketing and coordination to ensure interoperability and a user experience that can compete with the status quo. Common authentication and authorisation standards for digital identity and login and communication standards that work across applications and services will help break down silos and create real benefits to users and companies to motivate the move away from digital monopolies. It’s time to push for serious funding and resources into such public infrastructure to create an internet and web that works for everyone, just like Tim’s original vision.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>GoogleMeetRoulette: Joining random meetings</title>
<link>https://www.martinvigo.com/googlemeetroulette</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.martinvigo.com/googlemeetroulette</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago, I was at a friend’s house and he mentioned he had to join a work meeting. He used &lt;a href=&quot;https://meet.google.com/_meet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Google Meet&lt;/a&gt; to join. The WiFi was acting weird and he was not able to follow the discussion. Someone suggested that he could “call in” making a regular phone call. I overheard that and immediately found myself wondering if there was a way to join meetings I had not been invited to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today’s world and global market it is common to have teams spread all around the world. Corporations have offices everywhere, customers can be located in other countries, vendors operate overseas, and in general we have a need to communicate with people that are not in the same location as us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daily meetings are something many in the tech industry can relate to. And with teams, customers and vendors in different physical locations, it is common to use video calls. Many times, sensitive topics are discussed. Security, architectures, all hands, financial results, roadmap plannings, new features… These are only a few of the confidential topics discussed in video calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Google Meet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Meet is a re-invention of Google Hangouts with features aimed at businesses. It is part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsuite.google.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;G-Suite&lt;/a&gt; which is a set of services in the cloud. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsuite.google.com/customers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Looking at their website&lt;/a&gt;, it is used by many companies including Fortune 500. I can only assume that these companies will use Google Meet to have confidential meetings. Let’s see if we can join them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not focus on the usual way of joining a meeting using the browser and clicking the Google Meet link to join after login in. Instead, I was interested in understanding how the “call in” feature worked as it is a regular phone call and I wanted to know how authentication was handled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Calling into meetings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your company uses G-Suite and pays the Enterprise license, in addition to a link, you will be served a phone number and a 4 digit PIN when you create a new meeting in Google Calendar. Anyone can dial the number + PIN to join the meeting in “voice only” mode. This is very handy as it allows attendees to join even if they don’t have internet or don’t want to use it intensively (if you are traveling internationally, for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-24-at-12.18.35-AM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-649&quot; title=&quot;Google Meet information&quot; src=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-24-at-12.18.35-AM-300x154.png&quot; alt=&quot;Google Meet information&quot; width=&quot;497&quot; height=&quot;255&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-24-at-12.18.35-AM-300x154.png 300w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-24-at-12.18.35-AM-768x395.png 768w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-24-at-12.18.35-AM-1024x527.png 1024w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-24-at-12.18.35-AM.png 1174w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 497px) 100vw, 497px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Google Meet information&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this is a regular phone call, we can consider the phone number + PIN combination as the secret to authenticate into the meeting. Actually, we can think of the phone number as the username and the PIN as the password (a shared password for all attendees). In other words, &lt;strong&gt;If you know a phone number and the 4 digit PIN, you will be able to join that meeting&lt;/strong&gt;. We got ourselves two targets, finding phone numbers and PINs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finding phone numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phone numbers are probably not meant to be a secret but we do need to know the associated number to a meeting in order to be able to join it. Therefore, the first goal is to find a way to locate valid Google Meet phone numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Oldskool wardialing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, the first generation of hackers used wardialing to find mainframes, or any other machines connected to the phone line. Wardialing is a technique in which the attacker dials phone numbers massively looking for a machine to respond rather than a person. You can think of that time you dialed a number and started to hear weird beeping noises because you dialed the Fax number on that business card instead of the actual mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ToneLoc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ToneLoc&lt;/a&gt; would detect these machines and log the numbers for later inspection. Nowadays, wardialing can be done more efficiently and cheaper using VOIP services. We can use wardialing to find Google Meet phone numbers as it will always respond the same way, starting with a short 2 seconds sound. Still, this would be very noisy as we would be literally dialing all the numbers in the US. We have to do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Guessing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can try to see if there is a way to guess phone numbers that are assigned to Google Meet. I started by scripting the creation of meetings to generate hundreds of them and scraped the generated phone number. There is a number of things I wanted to find out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are phone numbers reused?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, they are. It would be difficult to have unique phone numbers for every meeting created given that phone numbers are limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are phone numbers unique per meeting?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found that recurring meetings (for example your weekly 1:1 with your manager) have always the same phone number and PIN combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are phone numbers random?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;I wasn’t able to find any useful pattern among all collected phone numbers.&lt;/del&gt; Keep reading :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most valuable information I got from this step is that &lt;strong&gt;recurring meetings always have the same phone number and PIN combination.&lt;/strong&gt; This is problematic because an employee that leaves the company will know this combination. He will be able to join all recurring meetings forever unless the meeting is deleted and created again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;HLR registers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HLR registers are stored in global databases and contain information regarding GSM subscribers. HLR registers are queried as part of the SS7 attacks to track victims as they provide, among others, information about the tower to which the mobile phone is connected. There are multiple services online that allow you to query this database but it costs money. We don’t need information about the towers or other sensitive data HLR registers provide, I just want to know if the phone number belongs to Google Meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/lookup&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Twilio offers a limited api&lt;/a&gt; that allows you to see some of the information related to a phone number. Among others, you can see the carrier to which the phone number belongs to. This is valuable information to help find Google Meet phone numbers. I created several meetings and verified the generated phone numbers with Twilio’s API. &lt;strong&gt;The carrier of phone numbers assigned to Google Meet is “Google (Grand Central) BWI – Bandwidth.com – SVR”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great! We have an API to query any phone number and check if the carrier is “Google (Grand Central) BWI – Bandwith.com – SVR”. But we can do even better…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Google search&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, one of the easiest way to find Google Meet phone numbers is… to use Google. Since we know the carrier, all we need to do is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Google+(Grand+Central)+BWI+-+Bandwidth.com+-+SVR%22&amp;amp;filter=0&amp;amp;biw=1481&amp;amp;bih=895&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Google it&lt;/a&gt;. There are tons of websites that contain information about specific phone numbers for multiple purposes like tracking spam callers, provide owner information, etc. Best of all, those pages are indexed by Google and other search engines. We can take advantage of this and use it to look for existing phone numbers belonging to “Google (Grand Central) BWI – Bandwidth.com – SVR” carrier. Not all of them will be mapped to Google Meet as Google Voice uses the same carrier, but it will give us a great starting point. Still, the goal is to aim for perfection. We need to do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Abuse international settings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is something that amazes me from the security research community is the will to “try harder”. I see it over and over again in conferences where researchers fight their way through to perfection. A 100% reliable exploit, re-engineering a piece of hardware to make it a few bucks cheaper, make an XSS work on every single browser, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by them, I wanted a truly reliable way of finding Google Meet phone numbers. I sat back and just started thinking about what other things I could try. If you have paid close attention to the image above, you may have noticed the label at the bottom that says: “&lt;em&gt;This phone number has been selected based on the Conference creator’s country settings&lt;/em&gt;“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting. This means that there must be international numbers I can dial to join meetings. Indeed, &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/meet/answer/7291345#supported&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;that’s the case&lt;/a&gt;. So, let’s start by checking if the carrier is the same. I changed my country settings on Google Calendar to Australia, created a meeting, and got an Australian number to dial. Next, I checked it using Twilio’s API and got that the carrier was “Symbio Networks”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was at this point that a happy coincidence happened. I did not know if this was a normal carrier or, like bandwith.com, a special carrier for VOIP services. So I thought I  should use Twilio’s API to check the next phone number thinking I would get a different carrier just to compare. Instead of checking the Google Meet meeting number +6129051730&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt;, I checked +612905173&lt;strong&gt;10.&lt;/strong&gt; The carrier was again “Symbio Networks”. How about +612905173&lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt;? “Symbio Networks”. +612905173&lt;strong&gt;20&lt;/strong&gt;? Again, same carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see… I generated a meeting, got a Google Meet phone number, and all subsequent phone numbers are also from the same carrier. Let me call and see if I get the Google Meet greeting to confirm. Bingo! &lt;strong&gt;For countries like Australia and Spain, Google Meet phone numbers are assigned in batches that are sequential.&lt;/strong&gt; I can generate a meeting myself and just check the subsequent phone numbers to obtain more Google Meet numbers. You can use them to join/find meetings in the US as the phone numbers from other countries are not specific to meetings in that country, they are global.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finding PINs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have effective ways of finding phone numbers, we need a way to find out the associated PIN. A 4 digit PIN gives us 10,000 possible combinations. Manually trying all possible PINs would be too slow and &lt;strong&gt;Google Meet only allows us to try 3 different PINs per call&lt;/strong&gt;. You can definitely call again but this is time consuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since manual bruteforcing is not feasible, can we automate it? Nowadays, there are a number of services available online to manage calls programmatically and at scale. Companies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Twilio&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bandwidth.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;bandwidth&lt;/a&gt; offer cheap APIs that allow you to, among others, make multiple calls and interact programmatically with them. It sounds exactly like what we need! &lt;strong&gt;If we know the phone number and we can make hundreds of calls at the same time trying different PINs, it should not take too long to bruteforce all 10k possibilities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something interesting I found while poking at the API, is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://meet.google.com/tel/xkw-tafu-shj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;there is a global, per country, phone number that is the same for all Google Meet meetings&lt;/a&gt;. The difference is that the PIN is 13 digits long instead of only 4 to add entropy. I wonder how many parallel calls this number can support and how easy it would be to perform a DoS. I did not try it as DoS testing is usually discouraged on production services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting behavior I found was that &lt;strong&gt;depending in the country you are in, the PIN length varies&lt;/strong&gt;. This is odd as all the security relies on the entropy of the PIN. Basically, some countries are more secure than others and USA is the least secure one with only 4 digit PINs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;GoogleMeetRoulette.py&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created an account in Twilio, added $20 and wrote a python script that would use their APIs to initiate multiple calls and try 3 different PINs at a time. To my advantage, I realized that I don’t need to wait for the recording to tell me that the first PIN was wrong to try the second and third one&lt;strong&gt;. I can enter 3 PINs at the same time and Google will accept the correct one. &lt;/strong&gt;This improves bruteforcing speed significantly. Making a call and trying 3 PINs waiting for the recording to end takes about 25 seconds. Trying 3 PINs at the same time, allows me to do it in just 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 seconds per call, 3 PINs at a time, 10,000 PINs to try. It would take about 9 hours to cover all PIN combinations making one call at a time. &lt;strong&gt;Because Twilio is designed to make calls at scale, we can make hundreds of calls at the same time making the process much faster.&lt;/strong&gt; The script fires so many calls that the line will be busy sometimes. Not a problem! The script will detect failed calls and simply retry. Actually, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-is-a-webhook&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Twilio notifies of failed calls immediately using webhooks&lt;/a&gt; making the script very efficient handling calls that did not go through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are wondering how the script knows if the PIN is correct or not, I take advantage of the call duration to find out. Instead of doing some fancy sound processing, I figured that Google Meet will end the call if I entered 3 PINs wrong. On the other hand, the call will continue if one of those 3 PINs is correct. Therefore, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/pause&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;I instruct Twilio to wait 10 seconds silently&lt;/a&gt; on the line before hanging up. This allows me to look at the call duration and figure out if I was able to join a meeting or not. If the call is ~17 seconds long, I know Google ended the call, hence the PIN guessing did not work. If the call is ~10 seconds longer, then I know I joined a meeting and one of the 3 PINs is valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did some benchmarks and &lt;strong&gt;on average it takes 25 minutes to try all 10k PINs and find 15 different valid PINs for 15 different meetings for a cost of $16.&lt;/strong&gt; Not bad!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Demo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ttfmake-embed-wrapper aligncenter&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jetpack-video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;540&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4TQRcNRjY54?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the demo shorter I am only bruteforcing 100 PINs in this demo, enough to show how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work was actually the basis of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/voicemailcracker/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;research I recently presented at DEF CON&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we can find phone numbers associated to Google Meet meetings and we can efficiently and economically bruteforce the PIN. This is sufficient to consider it a threat but there are some drawbacks (from attacker’s perspective) you may be thinking of. Let’s discuss them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Meetings are short and at a specific point in time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be thinking that in order to bruteforce a meeting you need to launch the attack during the meeting. That is not the case. &lt;strong&gt;From the moment a meeting is scheduled, a phone number is associated and anyone can join anytime, even before the meeting begins&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;This means that if you try to bruteforce a meeting that is scheduled for next week, you don’t need to wait till then to launch the attack, you can start right away and figure out the PIN. This is important because if not, we would not only have to figure out phone number and PIN, but also when the meeting would take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Google Meet displays who is in the meeting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would claim that nobody pays attention or verifies that there are no unexpected attendees before starting a meeting, specially for longer ones. Still, we want to be as sneaky as possible and I found some interesting behavior that can be exploited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;UI displays only a small amount of attendees&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/google-meet-ui.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-651 size-large&quot; title=&quot;Google Meet UI on a 15.4-inch MacBook Pro&quot; src=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/google-meet-ui-1024x605.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Google Meet UI on a 15.4-inch MacBook Pro&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;567&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/google-meet-ui-1024x605.jpg 1024w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/google-meet-ui-300x177.jpg 300w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/google-meet-ui-768x454.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Google Meet UI on a 15.4-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on your resolution, the UI will only display about 5 attendee profiles. You would have to specifically click through the list to see the other attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;UI displays name and profile picture when joining on a browser&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/google-meet-impersonation.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-653&quot; title=&quot;Google Meet impersonation&quot; src=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/google-meet-impersonation-300x236.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Google Meet impersonation&quot; width=&quot;565&quot; height=&quot;445&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/google-meet-impersonation-300x236.jpg 300w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/google-meet-impersonation-768x604.jpg 768w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/google-meet-impersonation-1024x806.jpg 1024w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/google-meet-impersonation.jpg 1268w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Google Meet impersonation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not relevant to our case (we are targeting “calling in”) it is interesting to mention that while you can see the attendees, what you are looking at is full names and profile pictures. Does it sound trustworthy? Think about it, full names and profile pictures, no email. Email is the only piece of information that is unique to a user in Google. Yet &lt;strong&gt;Google only displays full names and profile pictures. It takes one minute to create a Gmail account and set the full name and profile picture of the person we want to impersonate.&lt;/strong&gt; If Google Meet would show the email address, it would not be possible to impersonate attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;External attendees must be approved before joining a meeting which mitigates this issue to a certain extent, keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;External attendees need to be specifically approved before joining a meeting&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you try to join a meeting using the browser, you will need to be approved if you are not logged into an account assigned to the company’s domain. For example, if you are logged in to Gmail and try to join an ACME Inc. meeting, attendees will get a popup warning that someone external (It is a gmail.com account, not acme.com) is trying to join the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Google-Meet-approval-popup.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-663&quot; title=&quot;Google Meet approval popup&quot; src=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Google-Meet-approval-popup.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Google Meet approval popup&quot; width=&quot;691&quot; height=&quot;409&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Google-Meet-approval-popup.jpg 800w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Google-Meet-approval-popup-300x177.jpg 300w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Google-Meet-approval-popup-768x454.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 691px) 100vw, 691px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Google Meet approval popup&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the case for attendees calling in. &lt;strong&gt;Because phone calls cannot be authenticated, anyone is able to join over the phone without any previous approval&lt;/strong&gt;. This is very relevant because the security bar was significantly downgraded for attendees calling in VS attendees joining using a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Phone numbers are masked&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting one. For some reason, Google decided to mask the phone numbers of attendees calling in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-24-at-5.59.15-AM.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-662&quot; title=&quot;Masked phone number&quot; src=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-24-at-5.59.15-AM-1024x573.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Masked phone number&quot; width=&quot;687&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-24-at-5.59.15-AM.jpg 1024w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-24-at-5.59.15-AM-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-24-at-5.59.15-AM-768x430.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Masked phone number&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the UI displays phone numbers like 555-XXXX-XX55. I don’t know the reason for this decision but it allows me to perfectly impersonate attendees. &lt;strong&gt;I used the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.bandwidth.com/ap-docs/methods/availableNumbers/getAvailableNumbersLocal.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;bandwith.com API&lt;/a&gt; to search for available phone numbers using regex expressions. I bought a phone number that looks exactly the same as mine when you mask it like Google Meet does.&lt;/strong&gt; It cost 35 cents to impersonate myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;For you&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use G-Suite, there is a number of things you can do. First off, the admin can disable the option to call into meetings. I am not sure if you can disable it for specific meetings but it is something to consider for meetings where confidential information will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have to keep the call-in feature available, an option is to share a “password” for every attendee over email or include it in the meeting description. Before starting the meeting, attendees have to say the secret word and everyone can verify it. You would have to be on the lookout for new people joining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;For Google&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase the PIN size to make bruteforcing not feasible or too expensive&lt;/strong&gt;. Given that you can setup the call to automatically dial the PIN for you, it should be no problem to increase the PIN size to 8+ digits. Specially when some countries already have longer PINs than the US. Also take into account that numbers can be easily guessed as they are assigned sequentially in certain countries. It is worth pointing out that competitors like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gotomeeting.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;GoToMeeting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://global.gotowebinar.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;GoToWebinar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://zoom.us/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ZOOM&lt;/a&gt; are already doing this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain the same security bar across countries.&lt;/strong&gt; If Spain and Australia have 5 digit PINs, so should the US. Attackers will use the weakest link to join the meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t mask the phone number of attendees that call in and show email addresses of those joining using the browser.&lt;/strong&gt; It will prevent impersonation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attendees that call in need to be approved before joining. &lt;/strong&gt;If Google agrees that external attendees need to be approved before joining a meeting, attendees calling in should be considered external by default instead of trusted. This would at least be a chance to verify the phone number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rotate PINs for recurring meetings&lt;/strong&gt;. This will prevent ex-employees from still being able to join meetings once they have left the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Responsible disclosure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, I reached out to Google first to give them a chance to make changes. Working with them was one of the best engagements I have had so far. Very profesional and appreciative. They also granted me an ELEET bounty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Timeline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;03/29/2018 responsible disclosure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;04/13/2018 Google acknowledges issues and files bugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;05/08/2018 Google issues bounty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;07/20/2018 Google confirms fixes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;07/28/2018 Google reverts some fixes due to customer complaints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10/04/2018 Google gives green light for public disclosure&lt;/li&gt;

<title>The Apple II Source Code for the LOGO Language Found</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2018/10/Untitled-6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Apple II LOGO Language&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2018/10/Untitled-6.png 732w, https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2018/10/Untitled-6-150x48.png 150w, https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2018/10/Untitled-6-300x95.png 300w, https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2018/10/Untitled-6-600x190.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adafruit visited the history of the LOGO “turtle graphics” language &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/05/07/the-history-of-turtle-bots-logo/&quot;&gt;not long ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now on Twitter, folks have found the source code for the MIT LOGO program used on Apple II computers, later licensed to Terrapin. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PDP-10/its/blob/master/src/aplogo/logo.958&quot;&gt;Source on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the program was written on a big iron Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-10 mainframe running the Incompatible Timesharing System (ITS). The code is dated September 4th, 1980.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;account-group js-account-group js-action-profile js-user-profile-link js-nav&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/larsbrinkhoff&quot; data-user-id=&quot;3128746474&quot;&gt;Lars Brinkhoff‏&lt;/a&gt; found it and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/larsbrinkhoff/status/1047366585546149890&quot;&gt;posted the discovery on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. He received permission from the authors to post the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is in 6502 assembly and the program works the whole Apple II memory map for functionality. The code was built by a cross assembler which came from the DECUS user group and originally ran on the DEC’s proprietary TOPS-10 operating system.  It runs on ITS by way of a TOPS-10 system call emulator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very interesting programming archaeology – &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PDP-10/its/blob/master/src/aplogo/logo.958&quot;&gt;see the source code yourself&lt;/a&gt; along with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PDP-10/its&quot;&gt;full PDP-10 ITS image&lt;/a&gt; still maintained today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LSCI Logo, another LOGO implementation, was also licensed to Apple and is different from MIT’s LOGO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** Updated with some info from Mr. Brinkhoff – thank you! **&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://research.fb.com/facebook-open-sources-detectron/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today, Facebook AI Research (FAIR) open sourced &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.fb.com/downloads/detectron/&quot;&gt;Detectron&lt;/a&gt; — our state-of-the-art platform for object detection research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Detectron project was started in July 2016 with the goal of creating a fast and flexible object detection system built on Caffe2, which was then in early alpha development. Over the last year and a half, the codebase has matured and supported a large number of our projects, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870&quot;&gt;Mask R-CNN&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002&quot;&gt;Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection&lt;/a&gt;, which won the Marr Prize and Best Student Paper awards, respectively, at ICCV 2017. These algorithms, powered by Detectron, provide intuitive models for important computer vision tasks, such as instance segmentation, and have played a key role in the unprecedented advancement of visual perception systems that our community has achieved in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond research, a number of Facebook teams use this platform to train custom models for a variety of applications including augmented reality and community integrity. Once trained, these models can be deployed in the cloud and on mobile devices, powered by the highly efficient Caffe2 runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal in open sourcing Detectron is to make our research as open as possible and to accelerate research in labs across the world. With its release, the research community will be able to reproduce our results and have access to the same software platform that FAIR uses every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detectron is available under the Apache 2.0 license at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron&quot;&gt;https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron&lt;/a&gt;. We’re also releasing extensive performance baselines for more than 70 pre-trained models that are available to download from our model zoo.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Once seniors are too old to drive, our transportation system fails them</title>
<link>https://www.vox.com/2015/6/12/8768827/seniors-aging-car-driving</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.vox.com/2015/6/12/8768827/seniors-aging-car-driving</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, my grandfather gave up his car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the early years of his retirement, he'd been very active, volunteering at the local library and chauffeuring older folks who couldn't drive themselves. Over time, he slowed down, but remained independent — so much so that after a year or so in a retirement home, he stubbornly moved back into his own apartment. Though he was in his 80s, he didn't like the idea of being surrounded by — as he put it — &quot;old people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, his health declined to the point where it really wasn't safe for him to drive anymore. And though he used to take long walks daily, he could no longer traverse the vast parking lots and six-lane arterial roads surrounding his suburban Maryland apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=&quot;right&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&quot;As people have aged in the suburbs, they've been left behind&quot;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, he ended up largely stuck at home, entirely dependent on family to bring him food, give him rides, and provide simple human contact. In his final years, the car-based transportation system he'd relied on for his whole life really failed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His story is shared by millions of other American seniors, &lt;a href=&quot;http://assets.aarp.org/rgcenter/il/beyond_50_communities.pdf&quot;&gt;about 80 percent&lt;/a&gt; of whom live outside of urban areas. &quot;As people have aged in the suburbs, they've been left behind,&quot; says &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iidc.indiana.edu/index.php?pageId=44&amp;amp;mode=mod_md&amp;amp;action=display_detail&amp;amp;md_id=29&quot;&gt;Phil Stafford&lt;/a&gt;, director of Indiana University's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iidc.indiana.edu/?pageId=31&quot;&gt;Center on Aging and Community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the problem is growing. Americans are getting older: &lt;a href=&quot;http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html&quot;&gt;14 percent&lt;/a&gt; are currently over the age of 65, and that's expected to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.census.gov/prod/2014pubs/p25-1140.pdf&quot;&gt;surpass 20 percent by 2030&lt;/a&gt;. Modern medicine has extended people's lifespans — and people are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vox.com/2015/1/11/7517211/end-of-life-care&quot;&gt;spending more years with less physical independence&lt;/a&gt;. And yet a smaller percentage of seniors move in with family or to retirement homes than in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is an unintended consequence of car-oriented planning,&quot; Stafford says. &quot;We thought we were creating ideal communities for young families, but weren't thinking what it'd all look like 30 years down the road.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sprawl forces seniors to drive (even when it's not safe)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who lives long enough will likely lose the ability to safely operate a car. But &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.claimsjournal.com/news/national/2012/09/19/213818.htm&quot;&gt;most states don't require driving tests&lt;/a&gt; for elderly drivers renewing their licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many keep driving for longer than they should — and that can be seen in data on fatal crashes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__image&quot; data-original=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3776074/Screen%20Shot%202015-06-09%20at%205.35.37%20PM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;c-dynamic-image&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-chorus-optimize-field=&quot;main_image&quot; data-cid=&quot;site/dynamic_size_image-1516693275_7190_76347&quot; data-cdata=&quot;{&amp;quot;asset_id&amp;quot;:3776074,&amp;quot;ratio&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;}&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3776074/Screen%20Shot%202015-06-09%20at%205.35.37%20PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__meta&quot;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iihs.org/iihs/topics/t/older-drivers/fatalityfacts/older-people&quot;&gt;Insurance Institute for Highway Safety&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drivers are way more likely to be involved in fatal crashes past the age of 75. And for those 85-plus, the data is even worse than it is for teens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is mostly because in the event of a crash, older drivers are more likely to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/older_adult_drivers/&quot;&gt;die from injuries&lt;/a&gt; than younger ones. But it's partly because older drivers have deteriorating vision and reaction time, which leads to more crashes overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean we should blame senior citizens for wanting to drive — it's an overlooked cost of a system that gives them no choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Giving up driving can leave seniors isolated&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__image&quot; data-original=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3784576/shutterstock_247410904.0.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;c-dynamic-image&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs&quot; alt=&quot;senior man&quot; data-chorus-optimize-field=&quot;main_image&quot; data-cid=&quot;site/dynamic_size_image-1516693275_1409_76348&quot; data-cdata=&quot;{&amp;quot;asset_id&amp;quot;:3784576,&amp;quot;ratio&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;}&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3784576/shutterstock_247410904.0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;senior man&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;(Shutterstock.com)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once seniors stop driving, those who remain in suburban homes are marooned in an environment designed to be traversed by car. The most obvious problem, says &lt;a href=&quot;http://geog.ufl.edu/people/faculty/golant/&quot;&gt;Stephen Golant&lt;/a&gt;, a gerontologist at the University of Florida, is access to goods and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But seniors who are isolated also have worse health outcomes and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/news/social-isolation-shortens-lifespan-1.12673&quot;&gt;lower life expectancies&lt;/a&gt;, even after adjusting for preexisting health conditions and other factors. This may be because they're less likely to get health advice and monitoring from family and friends and also because they miss the emotional benefits of regular human contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolation also means less tangible losses for both seniors and society at large. &quot;Pursuing the new relationships and learning opportunities that give meaning to life becomes more difficult if you're isolated,&quot; Stafford notes. And those who aren't seniors miss out on the chance to benefit from the millions of senior citizens who can no longer drive, but are capable of volunteering or contributing to society and our personal lives in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retirement homes partly solve this problem by providing contact with other residents and through shuttles for transportation to the outside world. But as part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ageinplace.org/&quot;&gt;aging in place movement&lt;/a&gt;, fewer seniors are moving to them than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In surveys, &lt;a href=&quot;http://assets.aarp.org/rgcenter/il/beyond_50_communities.pdf&quot;&gt;more than 90 percent&lt;/a&gt; of senior citizens say they want to stay in their current homes as long as possible. Right now, if they want to avoid isolation, they're often forced to give that up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Public paratransit shuttles are not enough&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__image&quot; data-original=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3784564/GettyImages-140796444.0.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;c-dynamic-image&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs&quot; alt=&quot;paratransit&quot; data-chorus-optimize-field=&quot;main_image&quot; data-cid=&quot;site/dynamic_size_image-1516693275_8025_76349&quot; data-cdata=&quot;{&amp;quot;asset_id&amp;quot;:3784564,&amp;quot;ratio&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;}&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3784564/GettyImages-140796444.0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;paratransit&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;A woman uses Boston's paratransit service. (Jonathan Wiggs/the Boston Globe via Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some seniors have another choice: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratransit&quot;&gt;paratransit&lt;/a&gt;. Typically, these are systems that work in tandem with public transportation, providing shuttle service to people with disabilities to get them to a bus or subway stop. Public transport agencies are &lt;a href=&quot;http://civilrights.findlaw.com/discrimination/transportation-and-the-americans-with-disabilities-act-ada.html&quot;&gt;required by the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act&lt;/a&gt; to offer this service to anyone with a disability, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apta.com/resources/reportsandpublications/Documents/TCRP_J11_Funding_Transit_Needs_of_Aging_Population.pdf&quot;&gt;about a third of its riders nationwide&lt;/a&gt; are over 65.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for those who live in sprawling suburbs not designed to be serviced by public transit, trying to use paratransit can be difficult — if not impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paratransit is only required to serve people living within 1.5 miles of a bus line, a range that excludes most suburban dwellers. Those eligible have to make appointments well ahead of time and block out an entire day for travel, since shuttles typically arrive within two-hour windows, like cable TV technicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__image&quot; data-original=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3784584/car.0.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;c-dynamic-image&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs&quot; alt=&quot;paratransit st. louis&quot; data-chorus-optimize-field=&quot;main_image&quot; data-cid=&quot;site/dynamic_size_image-1516693275_8729_76350&quot; data-cdata=&quot;{&amp;quot;asset_id&amp;quot;:3784584,&amp;quot;ratio&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;}&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3784584/car.0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;paratransit st. louis&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;St. Louis's paratransit eligibility zone for riders with disabilities (blue) leaves out large areas of the suburbs. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metrostlouis.org/PlanYourTrip/MapsSchedules/CallARide.aspx&quot;&gt;Metro St. Louis&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem is that lots of transit agencies have been getting stricter in deciding who's eligible for paratransit, sometimes limiting it to people who use wheelchairs. &quot;A lot of things that make you not a competent driver aren’t serious enough disabilities to qualify,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urban.org/author/sandra-rosenbloom&quot;&gt;Sandra Rosenbloom&lt;/a&gt;, author of a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urban.org/research/publication/roadblocks-ahead-seniors-who-dont-drive&quot;&gt;Urban Institute report&lt;/a&gt; on transportation for seniors, &lt;a href=&quot;http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/paratransit-stuck-in-the-slow-lane/&quot;&gt;told the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These restrictions share the same root cause: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gao.gov/assets/660/650079.pdf&quot;&gt;the cost of paratransit is ballooning&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__image&quot; data-original=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3781822/Screen%20Shot%202015-06-11%20at%2012.11.09%20PM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;c-dynamic-image&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-chorus-optimize-field=&quot;main_image&quot; data-cid=&quot;site/dynamic_size_image-1516693275_5258_76351&quot; data-cdata=&quot;{&amp;quot;asset_id&amp;quot;:3781822,&amp;quot;ratio&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;}&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3781822/Screen%20Shot%202015-06-11%20at%2012.11.09%20PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__meta&quot;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/alfresco/publication-pdfs/412825-Roadblocks-Ahead-for-Seniors-Who-Don-t-Drive.PDF&quot;&gt;Urban Institute&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's partly because the systems are being asked to serve growing numbers of seniors spread out in the suburbs. Cash-strapped transit agencies underfund them, providing the bare minimum of service required by the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a fundamental level, given the suburbs many seniors live in, paratransit might just not work well as a transportation solution, says &lt;a href=&quot;http://geog.ufl.edu/people/faculty/golant/&quot;&gt;Stephen Golant&lt;/a&gt;, a gerontologist at the University of Florida. &quot;It's not clear that it's the most effective way of getting older people to the goods and services they need.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of private senior-oriented shuttle services that help fill the gap. But they can be pricey, and don't work for those on smaller fixed incomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New solutions to senior transportation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that some communities and organizations are experimenting with new approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some are attempts to change development patterns in areas where seniors live. Stafford, for instance, is involved in planning a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livablecities.org/blog/lifetime-community-districts&quot;&gt;Lifetime Community District&lt;/a&gt;: an area that incorporates a series of neighborhoods in Bloomington, Indiana, arranged along a three-mile multi-use path. It will include grocery stores, doctors' offices, parks, and community centers that seniors can reach by walking or using a wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also the increasingly popular &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_village&quot;&gt;Elder Village&lt;/a&gt; model, implemented by dozens of organizations in different cities. It allows seniors to stay in their homes, with a mix of paid staff and volunteers giving rides, delivering groceries, and organizing social activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=&quot;right&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&quot;I think the Uber model is increasingly going to be important&quot;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other experts are optimistic that new technologies can help fill in the gap. &quot;I think the Uber model is increasingly going to be important,&quot; says Golant. &quot;All kinds of products and services will increasingly be at the fingertips of all people, including seniors.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He suggests that cities might start subsidizing Uber or Lyft rides for people who qualify for paratransit, as a more efficient way of allocating transit money. As an alternative, Stafford envisions nonprofit ride-sharing apps specifically tailored to seniors — and perhaps delivery of groceries and other goods as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than anything else, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vox.com/2014/5/28/5756736/the-case-for-self-driving-cars&quot;&gt;self-driving cars&lt;/a&gt; could revolutionize seniors' transportation options. Widespread self-driving technology is still years away, but Google has programmed cars that can safely navigate a heavily mapped area in Northern California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2014/10/google_self_driving_car_it_may_never_actually_happen.html&quot;&gt;experts are skeptical&lt;/a&gt; that they'll ever be functional in real-world driving conditions across the country. But if they do, they could provide an easy means of getting around for people who can no longer drive — allowing millions of seniors to remain in their homes without becoming isolated.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Netflix is now worth more than $100B</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/22/netflix-is-now-worth-more-than-100b/</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/gettyimages-503631250.jpg?w=738&quot; class=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;Netflix crossed a fun milestone today, crossing the $100 billion mark for its market cap as it once again surprised industry observers with better-than-expected growth in its subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ll get to the financial numbers in a minute but, as usual, the big story here is that it continues to wow Wall Street with impressive growth in its subscriber numbers. The company said it added more than 8 million new subscribers total after already setting pretty robust targets for the fourth quarter this year, giving it a healthy push as it crossed the $100 billion mark after the report came out this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the rundown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix’s biggest challenge has been to aggressively invest in good original content that’s going to bring in new subscribers. While its shows may clean up at various awards shows like the Emmys, it still has to show that it can convert those awards into raw subscribers. But thanks to what appears to be continuing success with its original content like &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;, as well other returning seasons for shows like &lt;em&gt;The Crown&lt;/em&gt;, it’s been able to continue its staggering run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the company’s core financials actually came in roughly in line with what Wall Street was looking for (which is still important), Netflix’s subscriber numbers are usually the best indicator for the core health of the company. That recurring revenue stream — and its growth — is critical as it continues to &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; aggressively spend on new content. The company said its free cash flow will be between negative $3 billion and negative $4 billion, compared to negative $2 billion this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that aggressive spend only seems to get more aggressive every time we hear from the company. Netflix is now saying that it expects to spend between $7.5 billion and $8 billion on content in 2018 — which is &lt;em&gt;around&lt;/em&gt; in line with what it said in October when it said it would spend between $7 billion and $8 billion. It’s the same range, but tuning up that bottom end is still an important indicator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix shows picked up 20 Emmy awards last year, but just having a shiny object on a shelf isn’t something that’s going to indicate that the company is going to continue to grow at a healthy clip. In the face of an increasingly crowded market, Netflix has to demonstrate its ability to continue to offer lasting value for subscribers — especially as it continues to grow abroad. The company, of course, has plenty of benefits in terms of how it handles its shows when it makes them itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also has to make sure its &lt;em&gt;brand&lt;/em&gt; also fits that narrative, as it &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/30/house-of-cards-ending/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;now finds itself dealing with issues like having to cancel &lt;em&gt;House of Cards&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — and that has a monetary impact as well. Netflix said it took a $39 million “non-cash charge in Q4 for unreleased content we’ve decided not to move forward with.” The company didn’t specify what content, but it’s dealt with some issues in the past several months that might necessitate the need to recalibrate its slate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix also tucked another newsy bit into the report: the addition of new board member Rodolphe Belmer, former CEO of Canal+. As the company continues to expand internationally, bringing on people with experience like Belmer of course makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the final slash line for the company’s report today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revenue&lt;/strong&gt;: $3.29 billion, compared to $3.28 billion estimates from Wall Street&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earnings&lt;/strong&gt;: 41 cents per share, in line with estimates from Wall Street&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q4 US subscriber additions&lt;/strong&gt;: 1.98 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q4 International subscriber additions&lt;/strong&gt;: 6.36 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q1 forecast US additions&lt;/strong&gt;: 1.45 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q1 forecast international additions&lt;/strong&gt;: 4.90 million&lt;/li&gt;

<title>“Get Out of Jail Free” Cards in New York</title>
<link>http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/01/get-jail-free-cards.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/01/get-jail-free-cards.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;pf-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the movies I’ve seen people who try to get out of a traffic ticket by telling the police officer they made a donation to the policeman’s ball, but those were comedies. I had no idea that not only does this exist there are &lt;em&gt;official&lt;/em&gt; cards. In fact, the police in New York are livid that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2018/01/21/police-union-slashes-number-of-get-out-of-jail-free-cards-issued/&quot;&gt;number of cards is being limited&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city’s police-officers union is cracking down on the number of “get out of jail free” courtesy cards distributed to cops to give to family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association boss Pat &lt;img class=&quot;alignright wp-image-72748&quot; src=&quot;http://2378nh2nfow32gm3mb25krmuyy.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/card-e1516581369117.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;365&quot; height=&quot;223&quot; srcset=&quot;http://2378nh2nfow32gm3mb25krmuyy.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/card-e1516581369117.jpg 628w, http://2378nh2nfow32gm3mb25krmuyy.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/card-e1516581369117-300x183.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px&quot;/&gt;Lynch slashed the maximum number of cards that could be issued to current cops from 30 to 20, and to retirees from 20 to 10, sources told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cards are often used to wiggle out of minor trouble such as speeding tickets, the theory being that presenting one suggests you know someone in the NYPD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rank and file is livid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They are treating active members like s–t, and retired members even worse than s–t,” griped an NYPD cop who retired on disability. “All the cops I spoke to were . . . very disappointed they couldn’t hand them out as Christmas gifts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Christmas gift of institutionalized corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tickethelp.com/blog/the-issue-with-pba-cards-in-nyc/&quot;&gt;another article&lt;/a&gt; on these cards which just gets all the more stunning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there are tiers of cards. Silver cards are the highest honor given to citizens. It’s almost universally honored by officers, and can also help save money on insurance. Gold PBA cards are only given to police officers and their families. You’d be hard-pressed finding a cop who won’t honor a gold card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold and silver cards! It gets better. You can buy these cards on eBay. Here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebay.com/itm/2018-NJ-PBA-CARD-SIGNED-PLEASE-MAKE-OFFER/222752842602?hash=item33dd1aa36a:g:u9gAAOSwCtJaLDtL&quot;&gt;gold New Jersey card&lt;/a&gt; on sale for $114. A silver &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebay.com/itm/NJ-PBA-CAR-SHIELD-2018-BONUS-OTHER-SHIELDS-AVAIL-PLS-INQUIRE-MAKE-OFFER/152875112611?_trkparms=aid%3D444000%26algo%3DSOI.DEFAULT%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D49894%26meid%3Dad21c7868f1643029c4b8d3769ab2473%26pid%3D100752%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D3%26sd%3D162859478048&amp;amp;_trksid=p2047675.c100752.m1982&quot;&gt;“family member”&lt;/a&gt; shield goes for $299. Some of these are probably fake. The gold and silver are rare but remember, cops get 20 to 30 regular cards so you can see why they might be upset at losing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regular cards have become more common as NYC hires more police. The union may in fact be trying to bump up its monopoly profit by restricting supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cards don’t just go to family members. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/11/nyregion/a-perk-for-friends-of-the-police-now-on-ebay.html&quot;&gt;rot is deep&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Union officials say the cards are also public relations tools and tokens of appreciation handed out to politicians, judges, lawyers, businessmen, civil service workers and members of the news media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A retired police officer on Quora explains &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/Do-law-enforcement-officers-have-a-code-or-a-culture-where-they-overlook-the-transgressions-of-other-cops-or-retired-cops-How-does-it-work-and-how-far-does-it-go&quot;&gt;how the privilege is enforced&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;__w2_ZVx4QRw_answer_content&quot; class=&quot;inline_editor_value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;The officer who is presented with one of these cards will normally tell the violator to be more careful, give the card back, and send them on their way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…The other option is potentially more perilous. The enforcement officer can issue the ticket or make the arrest in spite of the courtesy card. This is called “writing over the card.” There is a chance that the officer who issued the card will understand why the enforcement officer did what he did, and nothing will come of it. However, it is equally possible that the enforcement officer’s zeal will not be appreciated, and the enforcement officer will come to work one day to find his locker has been moved to the parking lot and filled with dog excrement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s not kidding. Here is what seems like a real police officer on a cop chat room (from &lt;a href=&quot;http://mimesislaw.com/fault-lines/shameless-police-culture-the-pba-card/5031&quot;&gt;Mimesis law&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important for me to get in touch with shield [&lt;em&gt;omitted&lt;/em&gt;] and ask him why he felt it necessary to say “I’m not even going to look at that” to my PBA card and proceed [sic] to write a speeding ticket on the Bronx River Parkway yesterday afternoon to my fukking WIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll show him the courtesy he so sorely lacks by not posting his name on a public forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any help would be appreciated.  Please inbox me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I will find you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find these cards especially odious as more and more police are &lt;a href=&quot;http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/03/the-ferguson-kleptocracy.html&quot;&gt;funding themselves through fines and forfeitures.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Politics-Principle-Not-Interest-Nondiscriminatory/dp/0521621879/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1516592315&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=buchanan+congleton&quot;&gt;Discriminatory taxation&lt;/a&gt; increases the tax rate. It’s one rule for the ruler and another for the ruled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cards are not a secret but I agree with my colleague Mark Koyama who remarked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you find out something about the country you live in that makes it appear little better than a corrupt, tinpot, banana republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span readability=&quot;20.418624161074&quot;&gt;Cryptocurrency mining is becoming a huge business and it's astonishing how this impacts the whole supply chain. Gamers have to suffer from low availability and extremely high pricing in the retail channel, and now we're seeing that the larger players are going straight to the source by contracting TSMC to make their in-house ASICs using the latest process technology.&lt;p&gt;We already touched on this a couple of days ago, but here's an interesting tweet from ARKInvest that shows just how large the crypto business is for TSMC. Bitmain, the largest Bitcoin miner on the planet, is now buying a whopping 20,000 16nm wafers a month from TSMC! That's double as much as in the previous quarter and a higher volume than what NVIDIA orders from TSMC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dutch tech site &lt;a href=&quot;https://nl.hardware.info/nieuws/55028/bitmain-bestelt-twintigduizend-wafers-bij-tsmc-voor-mining-met-asics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hardware.Info&lt;/a&gt; calculated that Bitcoin can get a maximum of 5,670 chips out of every wafer. In total, that would be enough for 600,000 Bitmain Antminer S9 systems per month, but the actual number will probably be lower as we don't know the yields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, TSMC pulled in $350 million to $400 million of revenue from cryptocurrency chips in the third quarter alone. Bloomberg &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-17/bitcoin-is-more-important-than-the-iphone-at-some-asia-suppliers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;notes that was about&lt;/a&gt; 4 to 5 percent of the foundry's revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

<title>Montana becomes first state to implement net neutrality after FCC repeal</title>
<link>http://thehill.com/policy/technology/370133-montana-becomes-first-state-to-implement-net-neutrality-rules-following-fcc</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://thehill.com/policy/technology/370133-montana-becomes-first-state-to-implement-net-neutrality-rules-following-fcc</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Montana Gov. &lt;a class=&quot;rollover-people-link&quot; href=&quot;http://thehill.com/person/steve-bullock&quot;&gt;Steve Bullock&lt;/a&gt; (D) signed an executive order on Monday requiring internet service providers with state contracts to abide by net neutrality principles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The order makes his state the first to push back on the Federal Communications Commission’s decision to repeal the open internet rules last month.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There has been a lot of talk around the country about how to respond to the recent decision by the Federal Communications Commission to repeal net neutrality rules, which keep the internet free and open. It’s time to actually do something about it,” Bullock said in a statement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This is a simple step states can take to preserve and protect net neutrality. We can’t wait for folks in Washington DC to come to their senses and reinstate these rules.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;dfp-ad-mosad_1-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;dfp-tag-wrapper wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The order says that in order to receive a contract with the state government, internet service providers must not engage in blocking or throttling web content or create internet fast lanes. Those practices were all banned under the Obama-era 2015 net neutrality order.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Republican FCC voted to dismantle those rules in December. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCC's repeal includes a ban on states implementing their own net neutrality rules, but Democratic-controlled legislatures &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehill.com/policy/technology/367254-states-pursue-net-neutrality-rules-after-fcc-rollback&quot;&gt;around the country&lt;/a&gt; are eager to challenge that provision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democrats are fighting back by pushing for legislation in Congress that would wipe out the FCC vote, suing to overturn it and now by implementing laws at the state level. They argue the rules were an important check on the power of companies that control access to the internet, such as Comcast and Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most Republicans, including FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, argue the rules were unnecessary and that existing laws are sufficient to preserve an open internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullock’s office said the executive order goes into effect immediately, but there will be a six-month grace period for companies to ensure that they’re in compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The governor said on Monday that he is encouraging his counterparts and legislators in other states to follow suit, promising to personally email a copy of his order to any who ask for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the FCC repealed its net neutrality rules, it said consumers should choose,” Bullock said in his statement. “The State of Montana is one of the biggest consumers of internet services in our state. Today we’re making our choice clear: we want net neutrality.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>German Union Steps Up Fight for ‘Modern’ 28-Hour Workweek</title>
<link>http://www.industryweek.com/labor-employment-policy/german-union-steps-fight-modern-28-hour-workweek</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.industryweek.com/labor-employment-policy/german-union-steps-fight-modern-28-hour-workweek</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;BERLIN — Germany’s largest union is bracing for a combative start to the new year as it presses demands for a 28-hour working week, warning employers to expect mass strikes in the battle for a better work-life balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mighty IG Metall union, which represents some 3.9 million workers in the metal and electrical industries, says it is ready to flex its muscles after initial negotiations with employers made little headway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An agreed no-strike period ends on December 31, and IG Metall CEO Joerg Hofmann has told employers to expect brief “warning strikes” from January 8, and he said more widespread action could follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If by the end of January the employers have not changed their stance, we will consider resorting to 24-hour strikes or calling a vote for a general strike,” Hofmann told DPA news agency this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing its bargaining power strengthened at a time of bulging order books and record-low employment in Europe’s top economy, the union is pushing for a 6% wage increase. The Gesamtmetall employers’ federation has so far offered 2%, setting the stage for both sides to meet somewhere in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far more controversial is IG Metall’s call for employees to be allowed to switch to a 28-hour week for a two-year period — with limited impact on wages. That demand has been met with fierce resistance from company bosses, and stirred wider debate about quality of life and the future of work in booming Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In certain circumstances, IG Metall says reduced working hours must not go hand-in-hand with a drastic salary cut — for instance when staff are caring for young children or ailing relatives. In those cases, the union wants employers to top up workers’ salaries to help make up for the shortfall that comes with clocking up fewer hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also wants employees to be guaranteed a return to a 35-hour week after two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Radical Rethink&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think IG Metall’s proposal is very modern,” professor Gustav Horn of the Hans-Boeckler Foundation think tank told the Nordwest Zeitung daily. He said it would inevitably lead to higher costs that would hurt the bottom line, but could also be a way for firms to hold onto their best workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In future, well-qualified employees will select those companies that offer flexible hours that suit their lives at that time,” he predicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank, said a shorter week would mainly hurt small and medium-sized companies who could struggle to meet production targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If it would be replicated throughout the economy, it could do serious damage,” he said, in a nod to IG Metall’s track record of paving the way for major changes to the work environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IG Metall, which represents the powerful car and machine manufacturing sectors so crucial to Germany’s economic success, led the campaign for a 35-hour week in the 1990s. But this time, it is pushing for a radical rethink on part-time work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The time has come for workers to demand more self-determination to adapt working hours to their personal situation,” Hofmann told reporters in October. He said the trend for more flexible working hours in recent years had mainly benefitted bosses who got staff to work longer days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;‘Costly, Unfair’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gesamtmetall employers’ federation has slammed IG Metall’s demand for less work at roughly the same pay as “too costly” and “unfair”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It says employees already have the option of working part-time if they wish, with a pay packet to match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our rule is: if you work more, you earn more. If you work less, you earn less,” Gesamtmetall chief Rainer Dulger said in a recent interview with regional media. He added that the proposed measure could lead to a shortage of skilled workers in sectors crucial to the country’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IG Metall has hit back at the criticism, saying firms were losing out on skilled workers by not meeting their needs, particularly among the female workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy is likely to spill over into politics in coming weeks, as Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives head into negotiations with the Social Democrats on forming another coalition government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former labour minister Andrea Nahles, who will be a main negotiator for the Social Democrats in the upcoming talks, has already said it was “a good thing” that IG Metall was putting working time at the heart of its demands.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Y Combinator is accepting applications for S18</title>
<link>http://www.ycombinator.com/apply/#Summer2018</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.ycombinator.com/apply/#Summer2018</guid>
<description>&lt;nav class=&quot;toc g3 right stick&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Related&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Elsewhere&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;&lt;article class=&quot;g5&quot; readability=&quot;17.577987421384&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Y Combinator is accepting applications for the &lt;strong&gt;Summer 2018&lt;/strong&gt; funding cycle. It will take place in &lt;strong&gt;Mountain View, CA&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;June--August 2018&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;19.416708605939&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0.94054054054054&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to apply, please submit your &lt;a href=&quot;http://apply.ycombinator.com&quot;&gt;application&lt;/a&gt; online by &lt;strong&gt;8 pm PT on March 24&lt;/strong&gt;. Groups that submit early have a small advantage because we have more time to read their applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;April 17&lt;/strong&gt;, by 10PM, we’ll invite the groups that seem most promising to meet us in Mountain View &lt;strong&gt;in late May&lt;/strong&gt;. We’ll reimburse reasonable travel expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decide who to fund after each day of interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1.8888888888889&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we invest in you, your group is &lt;strong&gt;expected to move to the Bay Area for June--August 2018&lt;/strong&gt;. You can of course leave afterward if you want, but it's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ycombinator.com/atyc/#siliconvalley&quot;&gt;good place&lt;/a&gt; for a startup to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you're accepted, we'll immediately get to work helping you set up your company, if it isn't already. As soon as your company exists, we'll write a check to it for the investment. You can spend the money however you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y Combinator doesn't supply office space&lt;/strong&gt;. We have space you can use if you need to, but we expect you to work out of wherever you find to live. It is no coincidence that so many successful startups have started this way; it's the ideal setup for the initial phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the 3 month cycle we'll have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ycombinator.com/atyc/#dinners&quot;&gt;dinners every Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; for all the founders. At each dinner we'll invite an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ycombinator.com/speakers/&quot;&gt;expert&lt;/a&gt; in some aspect of startups to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0.93220338983051&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have regular &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ycombinator.com/atyc/#officehours&quot;&gt;office hours&lt;/a&gt; year round for startups who want to talk about what they're building, or get advice on dealing with investors. We also have occasional events at YC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0.85546875&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During and after the 3 months we introduce startups individually to people who could help them. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ycombinator.com/atyc/#alumni&quot;&gt;founders of other YC-funded companies&lt;/a&gt; tend to be especially helpful. Today the YC alumni network is probably the most powerful network in the startup world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1.8787878787879&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 11 weeks in, we organize an event called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ycombinator.com/atyc/#demoday&quot;&gt;Demo Day&lt;/a&gt; at which the startups present to a carefully selected, invite-only audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YC doesn't really end after 3 months&lt;/strong&gt;; only the dinners do. We continue to give advice and make introductions as long as founders need—-and so does the informal network of YC-funded companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;btn apply&quot; href=&quot;http://apply.ycombinator.com&quot;&gt;Apply to Summer 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;whowefund&quot;&gt;Who We Fund&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do we choose who to fund?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people in your group are what matter most to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll fund companies from anywhere in the world. We fund companies doing everything from building mobile apps to diagnosing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll happily fund companies that just started and have nothing more than an idea. And we've funded companies that had over $20M in annual revenue and over 50 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong id=&quot;internationalFounders&quot;&gt;International founders, please note:&lt;/strong&gt; if your company is already incorporated as a non-United States company, to participate in YC you will need to convert your foreign company into a United States corporation (usually with a foreign subsidiary). While lawyers will drive this process, it will require a significant effort on your part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong id=&quot;minimumEquity&quot;&gt;You must have at least 10% equity in the startup to be considered a founder by Y Combinator.&lt;/strong&gt; Only founders can come to interviews if invited or attend batch events if accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Turning Down a Blockchain Job Offer</title>
<link>https://hookrace.net/blog/turning-down-blockchain/?</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://hookrace.net/blog/turning-down-blockchain/?</guid>
<description>&lt;span class=&quot;post-date&quot;&gt;2018-01-22 · &lt;a href=&quot;https://hookrace.net/blog/programming/&quot;&gt;Programming&lt;/a&gt; · &lt;a href=&quot;https://hookrace.net/blog/work/&quot;&gt;Work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recently received a job offer to work on a blockchain implementation. While the offer was very generous, I had to turn it down. In this post I want to collect the thoughts that went into my decision process leading to this conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not touched blockchain technology much before, other than reading the original &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf&quot;&gt;Bitcoin paper&lt;/a&gt; shortly after it was released and accepting Bitcoin donations for &lt;a href=&quot;https://ddnet.tw/&quot;&gt;DDNet&lt;/a&gt;. But I have always used those donations pretty much immediately, and thus I have no investment in cryptocurrencies either way and am thus impartial to their fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-good&quot;&gt;The Good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider the Bitcoin idea to be quite interesting as an electronic cash system that doesn’t require any trusted intermediary. This is a small and simple idea that combines old cryptographic ideas into something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job I got offered had a significantly higher salary attached than my current job. The new job would have been remote, thus enabling me to spend more time with my girlfriend and live in any location I wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would have been able to work in a nice programming language, developing a blockchain implementation from the ground up with a small group of colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bad&quot;&gt;The Bad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proof of work in the form of mining is currently the most common form of trustless consensus in blockchain systems. It requires immense amounts of computational hardware in the form of ASICs and GPUs as well as energy to supply them. The only function of this is to prevent any one actor to take over more than 50% of the mining market and thus controlling the currency. This is a large price to pay for replacing trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at it the other way: Trust can be seen as a shortcut that humanity has used for a long time in order not to require expensive proof of work. Most applications this still works fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies are doing initial coin offerings (ICOs), giving out their own cryptotoken to public investors, circumventing a proper IPO process. While companies often claim that their tokens will have another purpose, this is usually not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading about blockchain is horrible because of all the hype, cargo cult and politics surrounding it. Everyone who is talking positively about cryptocurrencies and making hyperbolic claims seems to have invested in them. So they might be trying to pump up the value of cryptocurrencies in order to profit themselves. It might be that this aspect is so dominant that the actual technological details are less relevant. It feels like talking to a religious group that is trying to convert you to the one true faith that will solve all problems you and society have. I wish it was possible to filter out everyone who had money invested in the fate of cryptocurrencies in those discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like people already know that they want to use a blockchain even before they understand what the problem is, basically a solution in search of problems. The main use of cryptocurrencies right now seems to be as a speculation device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-conclusion&quot;&gt;The Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end I guess I don’t want to be associated with the current state of the blockchain ecosystem. So even if the job offer is great, I have to deny it. It took me a long time to realize this for myself and getting my priorities straight.&lt;/p&gt;

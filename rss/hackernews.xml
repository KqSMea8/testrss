<description>&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;g-lead-in&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he real Jessica Rychly&lt;/span&gt; is a Minnesota teenager with a broad smile and wavy hair. She likes reading and the rapper Post Malone. When she goes on Facebook or Twitter, she sometimes muses about being bored or trades jokes with friends. Occasionally, like many teenagers, she posts a duck-face selfie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;But on Twitter, there is a version of Jessica that none of her friends or family would recognize. While the two Jessicas share a name, photograph and whimsical bio — “I have issues” — the other Jessica promoted accounts hawking Canadian real estate investments, cryptocurrency and a radio station in Ghana. The fake Jessica followed or retweeted accounts using Arabic and Indonesian, languages the real Jessica does not speak. While she was a 17-year-old high school senior, her fake counterpart frequently promoted graphic pornography, retweeting accounts called Squirtamania and Porno Dan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;All these accounts belong to customers of an obscure American company named Devumi that has collected millions of dollars in a shadowy global marketplace for social media fraud. Devumi sells Twitter followers and retweets to celebrities, businesses and anyone who wants to appear more popular or exert influence online. Drawing on an estimated stock of at least 3.5 million automated accounts, each sold many times over, the company has provided customers with more than 200 million Twitter followers, a New York Times investigation found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The accounts that most resemble real people, like Ms. Rychly, reveal a kind of large-scale social identity theft. At least 55,000 of the accounts use the names, profile pictures, hometowns and other personal details of real Twitter users, including minors, according to a Times data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“I don’t want my picture connected to the account, nor my name,” Ms. Rychly, now 19, said. “I can’t believe that someone would even pay for it. It is just horrible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;These accounts are counterfeit coins in the booming economy of online influence, reaching into virtually any industry where a mass audience — or the illusion of it — can be monetized. Fake accounts, deployed by governments, criminals and entrepreneurs, now infest social media networks. By &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/10/nearly-48-million-twitter-accounts-could-be-bots-says-study.html&quot;&gt;some calculations&lt;/a&gt;, as many as 48 million of Twitter’s reported active users — nearly 15 percent — are automated accounts designed to simulate real people, though the company claims that number is far lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;In November, Facebook disclosed to investors that it had at least twice as many fake users as it previously estimated, indicating that up to 60 million automated accounts may roam the world’s largest social media platform. These fake accounts, known as bots, can help sway advertising audiences and reshape political debates. They can defraud businesses and ruin reputations. Yet their creation and sale fall into a legal gray zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“The continued viability of fraudulent accounts and interactions on social media platforms — and the professionalization of these fraudulent services — is an indication that there’s still much work to do,” said Senator Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat and ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which has been investigating the spread of fake accounts on Facebook, Twitter and other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Despite rising criticism of social media companies and growing scrutiny by elected officials, the trade in fake followers has remained largely opaque. While Twitter and other platforms prohibit buying followers, Devumi and dozens of other sites openly sell them. And social media companies, whose market value is closely tied to the number of people using their services, make their own rules about detecting and eliminating fake accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Devumi’s founder, German Calas, denied that his company sold fake followers and said he knew nothing about social identities stolen from real users. “The allegations are false, and we do not have knowledge of any such activity,” Mr. Calas said in an email exchange in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The Times reviewed business and court records showing that Devumi has more than 200,000 customers, including reality television stars, professional athletes, comedians, TED speakers, pastors and models. In most cases, the records show, they purchased their own followers. In others, their employees, agents, public relations companies, family members or friends did the buying. For just pennies each — sometimes even less — Devumi offers Twitter followers, views on YouTube, plays on SoundCloud, the music-hosting site, and endorsements on LinkedIn, the professional-networking site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The actor John Leguizamo has Devumi followers. So do Michael Dell, the computer billionaire, and Ray Lewis, the football commentator and former Ravens linebacker. Kathy Ireland, the onetime swimsuit model who today presides over a half-billion-dollar licensing empire, has hundreds of thousands of fake Devumi followers, as does Akbar Gbajabiamila, the host of the show “American Ninja Warrior.” Even a Twitter board member, Martha Lane Fox, has some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;At a time when Facebook, Twitter and Google are grappling with an epidemic of political manipulation and fake news, Devumi’s fake followers also serve as phantom foot soldiers in political battles online. Devumi’s customers include both avid supporters and fervent critics of President Trump, and both liberal cable pundits and a reporter at the alt-right bastion Breitbart. Randy Bryce, an ironworker seeking to unseat Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, purchased Devumi followers in 2015, when he was a blogger and labor activist. Louise Linton, the wife of the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, bought followers when she was trying to gain traction as an actress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Devumi’s products serve politicians and governments overseas, too. An editor at China’s state-run news agency, Xinhua, paid Devumi for hundreds of thousands of followers and retweets on Twitter, which the country’s government has banned but sees as a forum for issuing propaganda abroad. An adviser to Ecuador’s president, Lenín Moreno, bought tens of thousands of followers and retweets for Mr. Moreno’s campaign accounts during last year’s elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Kristin Binns, a Twitter spokeswoman, said the company did not typically suspend users suspected of buying bots, in part because it is difficult for the business to know who is responsible for any given purchase. Twitter would not say whether a sample of fake accounts provided by The Times — each based on a real user — violated the company’s policies against impersonation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“We continue to fight hard to tackle any malicious automation on our platform as well as false or spam accounts,” Ms. Binns said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Unlike some social media companies, Twitter does not require accounts to be associated with a real person. It also permits more automated access to its platform than other companies, making it easier to set up and control large numbers of accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-interactive jumbo&quot; id=&quot;interactive-00bots-code&quot; data-id=&quot;100000005581503&quot; data-slug=&quot;00bots-code&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-interactive-wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;interactive-headline&quot;&gt;Three Types of Twitter Bots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;interactive-summary&quot;&gt;Tweets from a Twitter bot look just like those of a normal user, but a bot’s tweets are generated by a computer program, rather than a person. Below are three examples of common bot types you might encounter on Twitter and an approximation of the code controls them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;By Rich Harris and Danny DeBelius&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“Social media is a virtual world that is filled with half bots, half real people,” said Rami Essaid, the founder of Distil Networks, a cybersecurity company that specializes in eradicating bot networks. “You can’t take any tweet at face value. And not everything is what it seems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Including, it turns out, Devumi itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Last year, three billion people logged on to social media networks like Facebook, WhatsApp and China’s Sina Weibo. The world’s collective yearning for connection has not only reshaped the Fortune 500 and upended the advertising industry but also created a new status marker: the number of people who follow, like or “friend” you. For some entertainers and entrepreneurs, this virtual status is a real-world currency. Follower counts on social networks help determine who will hire them, how much they are paid for bookings or endorsements, even how potential customers evaluate their businesses or products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;High follower counts are also critical for so-called influencers, a budding market of amateur tastemakers and YouTube stars where advertisers now lavish billions of dollars a year on sponsorship deals. The more people influencers reach, the more money they make. According to data collected by Captiv8, a company that connects influencers to brands, an influencer with 100,000 followers might earn an average of $2,000 for a promotional tweet, while an influencer with a million followers might earn $20,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Genuine fame often translates into genuine social media influence, as fans follow and like their favorite movie stars, celebrity chefs and models. But shortcuts are also available: On sites like Social Envy and DIYLikes.com, it takes little more than a credit-card number to buy a huge following on almost any social media platform. Most of these sites offer what they describe as “active” or “organic” followers, never quite stating whether real people are behind them. Once purchased, the followers can be a powerful tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“You see a higher follower count, or a higher retweet count, and you assume this person is important, or this tweet was well received,” said Rand Fishkin, the founder of Moz, a company that makes search engine optimization software. “As a result, you might be more likely to amplify it, to share it or to follow that person.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Twitter and Facebook can be similarly influenced. “Social platforms are trying to recommend stuff — and they say, ‘Is the stuff we are recommending popular?’” said Julian Tempelsman, the co-founder of Smyte, a security firm that helps companies combat online abuse, bots and fraud. “Follower counts are one of the factors social media platforms use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Search on Google for how to buy more followers, and Devumi often turns up among the first results. Visitors are greeted by a polished website listing a Manhattan address, displaying testimonials from customers and a money-back guarantee. Best of all, Devumi claims, the company’s products are blessed by the platform for which they are selling followers. “We only use promotion techniques that are Twitter approved so your account is never at risk of getting suspended or penalized,” Devumi’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://devumi.com/twitter-followers/&quot;&gt;website promises&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;To better understand Devumi’s business, we became a customer. In April, The Times set up a test account on Twitter and paid Devumi $225 for 25,000 followers, or about a penny each. As advertised, the first 10,000 or so looked like real people. They had pictures and full names, hometowns and often authentic-seeming biographies. One account looked like that of Ms. Rychly, the young Minnesota woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;But on closer inspection, some of the details seemed off. The account names had extra letters or underscores, or easy-to-miss substitutions, like a lowercase “L” in place of an uppercase “I.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-interactive jumbo&quot; id=&quot;interactive-00bots-bizarro&quot; data-id=&quot;100000005581502&quot; data-slug=&quot;00bots-bizarro&quot; readability=&quot;8.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-interactive-wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;interactive-headline&quot;&gt;How to Spot a Devumi Bot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;interactive-summary&quot;&gt;Devumi claims to use its own “private network of hand-picked real and active Twitter users and influencers”. In reality, it sells bots with stolen profiles. Here are the details that give them away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;By Rich Harris and Danny DeBelius&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The next 15,000 followers from Devumi were more obviously suspect: no profile pictures, and jumbles of letters, numbers and word fragments instead of names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;In August, a Times reporter emailed Mr. Calas, asking if he would answer questions about Devumi. Mr. Calas did not respond. Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/fake-twitter-followers-and-interactions&quot;&gt;forbids&lt;/a&gt; selling or buying followers or retweets, and Devumi promises customers absolute discretion. “Your info is always kept confidential,” the company’s website reads. “Our followers look like any other followers and are always delivered naturally. The only way anyone will know is if you tell them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;But company records reviewed by The Times revealed much of what Devumi and its customers prefer to conceal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Most of Devumi’s best-known buyers are selling products, services or themselves on social media. In interviews, their explanations varied. They bought followers because they were curious about how it worked, or felt pressure to generate high follower counts for themselves or their customers. “Everyone does it,” said the actress Deirdre Lovejoy, a Devumi customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;While some said they believed Devumi was supplying real potential fans or customers, others acknowledged that they knew or suspected they were getting fake accounts. Several said they regretted their purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“It’s fraud,” said James Cracknell, a British rower and Olympic gold medalist who bought 50,000 followers from Devumi. “People who judge by how many likes or how many followers, it’s not a healthy thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Ms. Ireland has over a million followers on Twitter, which she often uses to promote companies with whom she has endorsement deals. The Wisconsin-based American Family Insurance, for example, said that the former model was one of its most influential Twitter “brand ambassadors,” celebrities who are paid to help promote products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;But in January last year, Ms. Ireland had only about 160,000 followers. The next month, an employee at the branding agency she owns, Sterling/Winters, spent about $2,000 for 300,000 more followers, according to Devumi records. The employee later made more purchases, he acknowledged in an interview. Much of Ms. Ireland’s Twitter following appears to consist of bots, a Times analysis found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;A spokeswoman said that the employee had acted without Ms. Ireland’s authorization and had been suspended after The Times asked about the purchases. “I’m sure he thought he was fulfilling his duties, but it’s not something he should have done,” said the spokeswoman, Rona Menashe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Similarly, Ms. Lane Fox, a British e-commerce pioneer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/baroness-lane-fox-of-soho/4275&quot;&gt;member of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; and Twitter board member, blamed a “rogue employee” for a series of follower purchases spanning more than a year. She declined to name the person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Several Devumi customers or their representatives contacted by The Times declined to comment, among them Mr. Leguizamo, whose followers were bought by an associate. Many more did not respond to repeated efforts to contact them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;A few denied making Devumi purchases. They include Ashley Knight, Mr. Lewis’s personal assistant, whose email address was listed on an order for 250,000 followers, and Eric Kaplan, a friend to Mr. Trump and motivational speaker whose personal email address was associated with eight orders. A Twitter account belonging to Paul Hollywood, the celebrity baker, was deleted after The Times emailed him with questions. Mr. Hollywood then sent a reply: “Account does not exist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-interactive jumbo&quot; id=&quot;interactive-00bots-clients&quot; data-id=&quot;100000005599227&quot; data-slug=&quot;00bots-clients&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-interactive-wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;interactive-headline&quot;&gt;Devumi’s Web&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;interactive-summary&quot;&gt;Many of these celebrities, business leaders, sports stars and other Twitter users bought their own followers, records show. In other cases, the purchases were made by their employees, agents, family members or other associates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;By Rich Harris and Danny DeBelius&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Over two years, the Democratic public relations consultant and CNN contributor Hilary Rosen bought more than a half-million fake followers from Devumi. Ms. Rosen previously spent more than a decade as head of the Recording Industry Association of America. In an interview, she described the purchases as “an experiment I did several years ago to see how it worked.” She made more than a dozen purchases of followers from 2015 to 2017, according to company records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Other buyers said they had faced pressure from employers to generate social media followers. Marcus Holmlund, a young freelance writer, was at first thrilled when Wilhelmina, the international modeling agency, hired him to manage its social media efforts. But when Wilhelmina’s Twitter following didn’t grow fast enough, Mr. Holmlund said, a supervisor told him to buy followers or find another job. In 2015, despite misgivings, he began making monthly Devumi purchases out of his own pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“I felt stuck with the threat of being fired, or worse, never working in fashion again,” said Mr. Holmlund, who left in late 2015. “Since then, I tell anyone and everyone who ever asks that it’s a total scam — it won’t boost their engagement.” (A Wilhelmina spokeswoman declined to comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Several Devumi customers acknowledged that they bought bots because their careers had come to depend, in part, on the appearance of social media influence. “No one will take you seriously if you don’t have a noteworthy presence,” said Jason Schenker, an economist who specializes in economic forecasting and has purchased at least 260,000 followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Not surprisingly, Devumi has sold millions of followers and retweets to entertainers on the lower and middle rungs of Hollywood, such as the actor Ryan Hurst, a star of the television series “Sons of Anarchy.” In 2016 and 2017, he bought a total of 750,000 followers, about three-quarters of his current count. It cost less than $4,000, according to company records. Mr. Hurst did not respond to multiple requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Devumi also sells bots to reality television stars, who can parlay fame into endorsement and appearance fees. Sonja Morgan, a cast member on the Bravo show “The Real Housewives of New York City,” uses her Devumi-boosted Twitter feed to promote her fashion line, a shopping app and a website that sells personalized “video shout-outs.” One former “American Idol” contestant, Clay Aiken, even paid Devumi to spread a grievance: his &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/clayaiken/status/631273740991635460&quot;&gt;customer service complaint against Volvo&lt;/a&gt;. Devumi bots retweeted his complaint 5,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Mr. Aiken and Ms. Morgan did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;More than a hundred self-described influencers — whose market value is even more directly linked to their follower counts on social media — have purchased Twitter followers from Devumi. Justin Blau, a popular Las Vegas-based D.J. who performs as 3LAU, acquired 50,000 followers and thousands of retweets. In an email, Mr. Blau said a former member of his management team bought them without his approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;At least five Devumi influencer customers are also contractors for HelloSociety, an influencer agency owned by The New York Times Company. (A Times spokeswoman said the company sought to verify that the audience of each contractor was legitimate and would not do business with anyone who violated that standard.) Lucas Peterson, a freelance journalist who writes a travel column for The Times, also bought followers from Devumi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Influencers need not be well known to rake in endorsement money. According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/5030582/aspiring-child-youtubers-callum-ryan-erin-bradley-arabella-daho/&quot;&gt;recent profile&lt;/a&gt; in the British tabloid The Sun, two young siblings, Arabella and Jaadin Daho, earn a combined $100,000 a year as influencers, working with brands such as Amazon, Disney, Louis Vuitton and Nintendo. Arabella, who is 14, tweets under the name Amazing Arabella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;But her Twitter account — and her brother’s — are boosted by thousands of retweets purchased by their mother and manager, Shadia Daho, according to Devumi records. Ms. Daho did not respond to repeated attempts to reach her by email and through a public relations firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;While Devumi sells millions of followers directly to celebrities and influencers, its customers also include marketing and public relations agencies, which buy followers for their own customers. Phil Pallen, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/philpallen&quot;&gt;brand strategist&lt;/a&gt; based in Los Angeles, &lt;a href=&quot;https://philpallen.co/branding/&quot;&gt;offers customers&lt;/a&gt; “growth &amp;amp; ad campaigns” on social media. At least a dozen times, company records show, Mr. Pallen has paid Devumi to deliver those results. Beginning in 2014, for example, he purchased tens of thousands of followers for Lori Greiner, the inventor and “Shark Tank” co-host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Mr. Pallen at first denied buying those followers. After The Times contacted Ms. Greiner, Mr. Pallen said he had “experimented” with the company but “stopped using it long ago.” A lawyer for Ms. Greiner said she had asked him to stop after learning of the first purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Still, records show, Mr. Pallen bought Ms. Greiner more Devumi followers in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Marketing consultants sometimes buy followers for themselves, too, in effect purchasing the evidence of their supposed expertise. In 2015, Jeetendr Sehdev, a former adjunct professor at the University of Southern California who calls himself “the world’s leading celebrity branding authority,” began buying hundreds of thousands of fake followers from Devumi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;He did not respond to requests for comment. But in his recent best-selling book, “The Kim Kardashian Principle: Why Shameless Sells,” he had a different explanation for his rising follower count. “My social media following exploded,” Mr. Sehdev claimed, because he had discovered the true secret to celebrity influence: “Authenticity is the key.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Among the followers delivered to Mr. Sehdev was Ms. Rychly — or at least, a copy of her. The fake Rychly account, created in 2014, was included in the purchase orders of hundreds of Devumi customers. It was retweeted by Mr. Schenker, the economist, and Arabella Daho, the teenage influencer. Clive Standen, star of the show “Taken,” ended up with Ms. Rychly’s stolen social identity. So did the television baker Mr. Hollywood, the French entertainer DJ Snake and Ms. Ireland. (DJ Snake’s followers were purchased by a former manager, and Mr. Standen did not respond to requests for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The fake Ms. Rychly also retweeted at least five accounts linked to a prolific American pornographer named Dan Leal, who is based in Hungary and tweets as @PornoDan. Mr. Leal, who has bought at least 150,000 followers from Devumi in recent years, is one of at least dozens of customers who work in the adult film industry or as escorts, according to a review of Devumi records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;In an email, Mr. Leal said that buying followers for his business generated more than enough new revenue to pay for the expense. He was not worried about being penalized by Twitter, Mr. Leal said. “Countless public figures, companies, music acts, etc. purchase followers,” he wrote. “If Twitter was to purge everyone who did so there would be hardly any of them on it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Devumi has sold at least tens of thousands of similar high-quality bots, a Times analysis found. In some cases, a single real Twitter user was transformed into hundreds of different bots, each a minute variation on the original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-interactive jumbo&quot; id=&quot;interactive-00bots-flocks&quot; data-id=&quot;100000005589853&quot; data-slug=&quot;00bots-flocks&quot; readability=&quot;8.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-interactive-wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;interactive-headline&quot;&gt;Families of bots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;interactive-summary&quot;&gt;Individually, fake accounts are hard to detect. Study their group behaviour, and incriminating patterns begin to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;By Rich Harris and Mark Hansen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;These fake accounts borrowed social identities from Twitter users in every American state and dozens of countries, from adults and minors alike, from highly active users and those who hadn’t logged in to their accounts for months or years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Sam Dodd, a college student &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJh7aKCdVmwSZ31ZAC6ZYRA?view_as=subscriber&quot;&gt;and aspiring filmmaker&lt;/a&gt;, set up his Twitter account as a high school sophomore in Maryland. Before he even graduated, his Twitter details were copied onto a bot account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The fake account remained dormant until last year, when it suddenly began retweeting Devumi customers continuously. This summer, the fake Mr. Dodd promoted various pornographic accounts, including Mr. Leal’s Immoral Productions, as well as a link to a gambling website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“I don’t know why they’d take my identity — I’m a 20-year-old college student,” Mr. Dodd said. “I’m not well known.” But even unknown, Mr. Dodd’s social identity has value in the influence economy. At prices posted in December, Devumi was selling high-quality followers for under two cents each. Sold to about 2,000 customers — the rough number that many Devumi bot accounts follow — his social identity could bring Devumi around $30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The stolen social identities of Twitter users like Mr. Dodd are critical to Devumi’s brand. The high-quality bots are usually delivered to customers first, followed by millions of cheaper, low-quality bots, like sawdust mixed in with grated Parmesan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Some of Devumi’s high-quality bots, in effect, replace an idle Twitter account — belonging to someone who stopped using the service — with a fake one. Whitney Wolfe, an executive assistant who lives in Florida, opened a Twitter account in 2008, when she was a wedding planner. By the time she stopped using it regularly in 2014, a fake account copying her personal information had been created. In recent months, it has retweeted adult film actresses, several influencers and an escort turned memoirist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“The content — pictures of women in thongs, pictures of women’s chests — it’s not anything I want to be represented with my faith, my name, where I live,” said Ms. Wolfe, who is active in her local Southern Baptist congregation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Other victims were still active on Twitter when Devumi-sold bots began impersonating them. Salle Ingle, a 40-year-old engineer who lives in Colorado, said she worried that a potential employer would come across the fake version of her while vetting her social media accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“I’ve been applying for new jobs, and I’m really grateful that no one saw this account and thought it was me,” Ms. Ingle said. Once contacted by The Times, Ms. Ingle reported the account to Twitter, which deactivated it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;After emailing Mr. Calas last year, a Times reporter visited Devumi’s Manhattan address, listed on its website. The building has dozens of tenants, including a medical clinic and a labor union. But Devumi and its parent company, Bytion, do not appear to be among them. A spokesman for the building’s owner said neither Devumi nor Bytion had ever rented space there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Like the followers Devumi sold, the office was an illusion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;In real life, Devumi is based in a small office suite above a Mexican restaurant in West Palm Beach, Fla., overlooking an alley crowded with Dumpsters and parked cars. Mr. Calas lives a short commute away, in a penthouse apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;On &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/german-calas-bb181926/&quot;&gt;his LinkedIn profile&lt;/a&gt;, Mr. Calas is described as a “serial entrepreneur,” with a long record in the tech business and an advanced degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But Mr. Calas’s persona, too, is a mixture of fact and fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Mr. Calas, who is 27, grew up in South Florida, where as a teenager he learned web design and built sites for local businesses, according to earlier versions of his personal web page available on the Internet Archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Eventually he taught himself techniques for search engine optimization — the art of pushing a web page higher in search results. While in high school, he began taking classes at Palm Beach State College, where he earned an associate degree in 2012, according to a school spokeswoman. Within a few years, Mr. Calas was claiming to have built dozens of online businesses serving 10 million customers, now under the Bytion umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“I started this company with a thousand dollars in the bank, without investors, and only the burning passion for success,” Mr. Calas wrote last year on the job-listing site Glassdoor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;As Mr. Calas’s ambitions grew, so did his embroidery. &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20140221071512/http://gcalas.com:80/#/resume&quot;&gt;A copy of his résumé&lt;/a&gt; posted online in 2014 claimed that he earned a physics degree from Princeton University in 2000, when he would have been about 10 years old, and a Ph.D. in computer science from M.I.T. Representatives for both schools said they had no record of Mr. Calas’s attending their institution. His current LinkedIn page says that he has a master’s degree in “international business” from M.I.T., a degree it does not offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;According to former employees interviewed by The Times, turnover was high at Devumi, and Mr. Calas kept his operation tightly compartmentalized. Employees sometimes had little idea what their colleagues were doing, even if they were working on the same project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The ex-employees asked for anonymity for fear of lawsuits or because they were subject to nondisclosure agreements with Mr. Calas’s companies. But their comments are echoed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Bytion-Reviews-E1356490.htm&quot;&gt;reviews on Glassdoor&lt;/a&gt;, where some former employees said that Mr. Calas was uncommunicative and demanded that they install monitoring software on their personal devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Dozens of Devumi’s customer service and order fulfillment personnel are based in the Philippines, according to company records. Employing overseas contractors may have helped Mr. Calas hold down costs. But it also appears to have left him vulnerable to a kind of social identity theft himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Last August, Mr. Calas sued Ronwaldo Boado, a Filipino contractor who previously worked for Devumi as an assistant customer support manager. After being fired for squabbling with other members of his team, Mr. Boado took control of a Devumi email account listing more than 170,000 customer orders, Mr. Calas alleged in court papers. Then Mr. Boado created a fake Devumi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;His copycat company used a similar name — DevumiBoost — and copied the design of Devumi’s website, Mr. Calas alleged. (Mr. Boado did not respond to emails seeking a response to Mr. Calas’s claims.) The fake Devumi even listed the same phantom Manhattan address. Over a stretch of days last July, Mr. Boado, posing as a Devumi employee, emailed hundreds of Devumi customers to inform them that their orders needed to be reprocessed on DevumiBoost. Then he impersonated the customers, too, emailing Devumi under different aliases to ask that Devumi cancel the original orders. Mr. Boado, according to Mr. Calas, was trying to steal his customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Mr. Calas’s lawsuit also revealed something else: Devumi doesn’t appear to make its own bots. Instead, the company buys them wholesale — from a thriving global market of fake social media accounts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Scattered around the web is an array of obscure websites where anonymous bot makers around the world connect with retailers like Devumi. While individual customers can buy from some of these bare-boned sites — Peakerr, CheapPanel and YTbot, among others — they are less user-friendly. Some, for example, do not accept credit cards, only cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;But each site sells followers, likes and shares in bulk, for a variety of social media platforms and in different languages. The accounts they sell may change hands repeatedly. The same account may even be available from more than one seller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Devumi, according to one former employee, sourced bots from different bot makers depending on price, quality and reliability. On Peakerr, for example, 1,000 high-quality, English-language bots with photos costs a little more than a dollar. Devumi charges $17 for the same quantity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The price difference has allowed Mr. Calas to build a small fortune, according to company records. In just a few years, Devumi sold about 200 million Twitter followers to at least 39,000 customers, accounting for a third of more than $6 million in sales during that period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Last month, Mr. Calas asked for examples of bots The Times found that copied real users. After receiving the names of 10 accounts, Mr. Calas, who had agreed to an interview, asked for more time to analyze them. Then he stopped responding to emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Ms. Binns, the Twitter spokeswoman, said the company did not proactively review accounts to see if they were impersonating other users. Instead, the company’s efforts are focused on identifying and suspending accounts that violate Twitter’s spam policies. In December, for example, the company identified an average of 6.4 million suspicious accounts each week, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;All of the sample accounts provided by The Times violated Twitter’s anti-spam policies and were shut down, Ms. Binns said. “We take the action of suspending an account from the platform very seriously,” she said. “At the same time, we want to aggressively fight spam on the platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The company also suspended Devumi’s account on Saturday after the Times article was published online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Yet Twitter has not imposed seemingly simple safeguards that would help throttle bot manufacturers, such as requiring anyone signing up for a new account to pass an anti-spam test, as many commercial sites do. As a result, Twitter now hosts vast swaths of unused accounts, including what are probably dormant accounts controlled by bot makers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Former employees said the company’s security team for many years was more focused on abuse by real users, including racist and sexist content and orchestrated harassment campaigns. Only recently, they said, after revelations that Russia-aligned hackers had deployed networks of Twitter bots to spread divisive content and junk news, has Twitter turned more attention to weeding out fake accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Leslie Miley, an engineer who worked on security and user safety at Twitter before leaving in late 2015, said, “Twitter as a social network was designed with almost no accountability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Some critics believe Twitter has a business incentive against weeding out bots too aggressively. Over the past two years, the company has struggled to generate the user growth seen by rivals like Facebook and Snapchat. And outside researchers have disputed the company’s estimates for how many of its active users are actually bots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-interactive jumbo&quot; id=&quot;interactive-00bots-twitter&quot; data-id=&quot;100000005581504&quot; data-slug=&quot;00bots-twitter&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-interactive-wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;interactive-headline&quot;&gt;The Evolution of Twitter’s Timeline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;interactive-summary&quot;&gt;Small design changes over a number of years has placed an increasingly greater focus on user engagement with replies, retweets and likes in Twitter’s timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;By Rich Harris and Danny DeBelius&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“We’re working with completely unregulated, closed ecosystems that aren’t reporting on these things. They have a perverse incentive to let it happen,” said Mr. Essaid, the cybersecurity expert. “They want to police it to the extent it doesn’t seem obvious, but they make money off it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;In January, after almost two years of promoting hundreds of Devumi customers, the fake Jessica Rychly account was finally flagged by Twitter’s security algorithms. It was recently suspended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;But the real Ms. Rychly may soon leave Twitter for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“I am probably just going to delete my Twitter account,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Terraforming 1Password</title>
<link>https://blog.agilebits.com/2018/01/25/terraforming-1password/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.agilebits.com/2018/01/25/terraforming-1password/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I posted this tweet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1Password servers will be down for the next few hours. We are recreating our entire environment to replace AWS CloudFormation with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/HashiCorp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@HashiCorp&lt;/a&gt; Terraform. It is like creating a brand new universe, from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Roustem Karimov (@roustem) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/roustem/status/954912547555090433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 21, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tweet generated quite a bit of interest from people running or managing their services, and I thought I would share some of the cool things we are working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post will go into technical details and I apologize in advance if I explain things too quickly. I tried to make up for this by including some pretty pictures but most of them ended up being code snippets. 🙂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1Password and AWS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Password is hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS). We’ve been using AWS for several years now, and it is incredible how easy it was to scale our service from zero users three years ago to several million happy customers today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWS has many geographical regions. Each region consists of multiple independent data centres located closely together. We are currently using three regions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;N. Virginia, USA &lt;code&gt;us-east-1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Montreal, Canada &lt;code&gt;ca-central-1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frankfurt, Germany &lt;code&gt;eu-central-1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each region we have four environments running 1Password:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;staging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are counting, that’s 12 environments across three regions, including three production environments: &lt;a href=&quot;https://start.1password.com&quot;&gt;1password.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://start.1password.ca&quot;&gt;1password.ca&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://start.1password.eu&quot;&gt;1password.eu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every 1Password environment is more or less identical and includes these components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Virtual Private Cloud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon Aurora database cluster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caching (Redis) clusters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subnets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Routing tables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security roles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IAM permissions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auto-scaling groups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elastic Load Balancers (ELB)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Route53 DNS (both internal and external)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon S3 buckets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CloudFront distributions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key Management System (KMS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a simplified diagram:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://roustem.s3.amazonaws.com/simplified-1password-env.svg&quot; alt=&quot;env&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there are many components working together to provide 1Password service. One of the reasons it is so complex is the need for high availability. Most of the components are deployed as a cluster to make sure there are at least two of each: database, cache, server instance, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, every AWS region has at least two data centres that are also known as Availability Zones (AZs) – you can see them in blue in the diagram above. Every AZ has its own independent power and network connections. For example, Canadian region &lt;code&gt;ca-central-1&lt;/code&gt; has two data centres: &lt;code&gt;ca-central-1a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ca-central-1b&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we deployed all 1Password components into just a single Availability Zone, then we would not be able to achieve high availability because a single problem in the data centre would take 1Password offline. This is why when 1Password services are deployed in a region, we make sure that every component has at least one backup in the neighbouring data centre. This helps to keep 1Password running even when there’s a problem in one of the data centres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Infrastructure as Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be very challenging and error-prone to manually deploy and maintain 12 environments, especially when you consider that each environment consists of at least 50 individual components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why so many companies today switched from updating their infrastructure manually and embraced Infrastructure as Code. With Infrastructure as Code, the &lt;em&gt;hardware&lt;/em&gt; becomes &lt;em&gt;software&lt;/em&gt; and can take advantage of all software development best practices. When we apply these practices to infrastructure, every server, every database, every open network port can be written in code, committed to GitHub, peer-reviewed, and then deployed and updated as many times as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For AWS customers, two major languages could be used to describe and maintain the infrastructure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CloudFormation is an excellent option for many AWS customers, and we successfully used it to deploy 1Password environments for over two years. At the same time we wanted to move to Terraform as our main infrastructure tool for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Terraform has a more straightforward and powerful language (HCL) that makes it easier to write and review code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terraform has the concept of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/&quot;&gt;resource providers&lt;/a&gt; that allows us to manage resources outside of Amazon Web Services, including services like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datadoghq.com/&quot;&gt;DataDog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pagerduty.com/&quot;&gt;PagerDuty&lt;/a&gt;, which we rely on internally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terraform is completely open source and that makes it easier to understand and troubleshoot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are already using Terraform for smaller web apps at AgileBits, and it makes sense to standardize on a single tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to the JSON or YAML files used by CloudFormation, Terraform HCL is both a more powerful and a more readable language. Here is a small example of a snippet that defines a subnet for the application servers. As you can see, the Terraform code a quarter of the size, more readable, and easier to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;CloudFormation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;

        ]
    }

&quot;B5AppSubnet3&quot;: {

&lt;h4&gt;Terraform&lt;/h4&gt;

resource &quot;aws_subnet&quot; &quot;b5app&quot; {
  count             = &quot;${length(var.subnet_cidr[&quot;b5app&quot;])}&quot;
  vpc_id            = &quot;${aws_vpc.b5.id}&quot;
  cidr_block        = &quot;${element(var.subnet_cidr[&quot;b5app&quot;],count.index)}&quot;
  availability_zone = &quot;${var.az[count.index]}&quot;

    Application = &quot;B5&quot;

    Name        = &quot;${var.env}-b5-b5app-subnet-${count.index}&quot;
  }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terraform has another gem of a feature that we rely on: &lt;code&gt;terraform plan&lt;/code&gt;. It allows us to visualize the changes that will happen to the environment without performing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, here is what would happen if we change the server instance size from &lt;code&gt;t2.medium&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;t2.large&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Terraform Plan Output&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
#
# Terraform code changes
#
# variable &quot;instance_type&quot; {
#    type        = &quot;string&quot;
# -  default     = &quot;t2.medium&quot;

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 2 to destroy.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Terraform is a pleasure to work with, and that makes a huge difference in our daily lives. DevOps people like to enjoy their lives too. 🙌&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Migration from CloudFormation to Terraform&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to simply import the existing AWS infrastructure directly into Terraform, but there are certain downsides to it. We found that naming conventions are quite different and that would make it more challenging to maintain our environments in the future. Also, a simple import would not allow us to use the new Terraform features. For example, instead of hard-coding the identifiers of Amazon Machine Images used for deployment we started using &lt;code&gt;aws_ami&lt;/code&gt; to find the most recent image dynamically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;aws_ami&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
data &quot;aws_ami&quot; &quot;bastion_ami&quot; {
  most_recent = true
  
  filter {
    name   = &quot;architecture&quot;
    values = [&quot;x86_64&quot;]
  }
  filter {
    name   = &quot;name&quot;
    values = [&quot;bastion-*&quot;]
  }
  filter {
    name   = &quot;virtualization-type&quot;
    values = [&quot;hvm&quot;]
  }
  name_regex = &quot;bastion-.*&quot;
  owners     = [92135000000]
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took us a couple of weeks to write the code from scratch. After we had the same infrastructure described in Terraform, we recreated all non-production environments where downtime wasn’t an issue. This also allowed us to create a complete checklist of all the steps required to migrate the production environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, on January 21, 2018, we completely recreated 1Password.com. We had to bring the service offline during the migration. Most of our customers were not affected by the downtime because the 1Password apps are designed to function even when the servers are down or when an Internet connection is not available. Unfortunately, our customers who needed to access the web interface during that time were unable to do so, and we apologize for the interruption. Most of the 2 hours and 39 minutes of downtime were related to data migration. The 1Password.com database is just under 1TB in size (not including documents and attachments), and it took almost two hours to complete the snapshot and restore operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are excited to finally have all our development, test, staging, and production environments managed with Terraform. There are many new features and improvements we have planned for 1Password, and it will be fun to review new infrastructure pull requests on GitHub!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember when we were starting out we hosted our very first server with 1&amp;amp;1. It would have taken weeks to rebuild the very simple environment there. The world has come a long way since we first launched 1Passwd 13 years ago. I am looking forward to what the next 13 years will bring! 😃&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few questions and suggestions about the migration came up on Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By “recreating” you mean building out a whole new VPC with Terraform? Couldn’t you build it then switch existing DNS over for much less down time?&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-1672091797-tweet1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.agilebits.com/2018/01/25/terraforming-1password/#fn-1672091797-tweet1&quot; class=&quot;jetpack-footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is pretty much what we ended up doing. Most of the work was performed before the downtime. Then we updated the DNS records to point to the new VPC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couldn’t you’ve imported all online resources? Just wondering.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-1672091797-tweet2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.agilebits.com/2018/01/25/terraforming-1password/#fn-1672091797-tweet2&quot; class=&quot;jetpack-footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is certainly possible, and it would have allowed us to avoid downtime. Unfortunately, it also requires manual mapping of all existing resources. Because of that, it’s hard to test, and the chance of a human error is high – and we know humans are pretty bad at this. As a wise person on Twitter said: “&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/filler/status/955509298356015109&quot;&gt;If you can’t rebuild it, you can’t rebuild it&lt;/a&gt;“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, let us know in the comments, or ask me (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/roustem&quot;&gt;@roustem&lt;/a&gt;) and Tim (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stumyp&quot;&gt;@stumyp&lt;/a&gt;), our Beardless Keeper of Keys and Grounds, on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>1Password is hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS). We have been using AWS for several years now and it is amazing how easy it was to scale our service from zero users three years ago to several million users today. We recently switched from AWS CloudFormation to Terraform to manage our infrastructure</og:description>

<title>An Italian Song That Sounds Like English But Is Nonsense</title>

<description>&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/51272/image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Adriano Celentano performing in 1970.&quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-51272&quot;/&gt;Adriano Celentano performing in 1970. &lt;span class=&quot;caption-credit&quot;&gt;Giorgio Lotti/Mondadori Portfolio/ Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;section-start-text&quot;&gt;Before children learn how to&lt;/span&gt; speak properly, they go through a period of imitating the sounds they hear, with occasionally hilarious results, at least for their parents. Baby talk evolves into proto-words, so that “octopus” might come out as “appah-duece,” or “strawberry” as “store-belly.” But it’s not just children who ape the sounds of spoken language. There’s a long tradition of songs that “sound” like another language without actually meaning anything. In Italy, for example, beginning in the 1950s, American songs, films, and jingles inspired a diverse range of “American sounding” cultural products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;The most famous is probably “Prisencolinensinainciusol,” a 1972 song composed by legendary Italian entertainer Adriano Celentano and performed by him and his wife, Claudia Mori. The song’s lyrics sound phonetically like American English—or at least what many Italians hear when an American speaks—but are clearly total, utter, delightful nonsense. You really have to hear it to appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-VsmF9m_Nt8&quot; width=&quot;860&quot; height=&quot;538&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;“Prisencolinensinainciusol” fell under the radar upon release, but in 1973—once Celentano performed it on Italian public broadcaster RAI—the song topped charts in Italy, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;It was rediscovered across the pond in the YouTube age, when in 2010 &lt;em&gt;boingboing&lt;/em&gt;’s Cory Doctorow described a video of the song as “one of the most bizzare videos found on the internet,” and the 72-year-old Celentano was interviewed for an episode of National Public Radio’s “All Things Considered.” “Ever since I started singing, I was very influenced by American music and everything Americans did,” Celentano said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;He wasn’t alone. After World War II, American culture started to exert its influence in many parts of Europe. The phenomenon was especially strong in Italy, where the arrival of American troops in Rome in June 1944 helped mark the country’s liberation from fascism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/51125/image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;American forces in Rome on June 5, 1944. &quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-51125&quot;/&gt;American forces in Rome on June 5, 1944. &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberazione_di_Roma#/media/File:TD_al_Colosseo_1944.jpg&quot;&gt;Public domain&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;“Americanization” was captured in films such as 1954’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046705/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;An American in Rome&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which Italian actor Alberto Sordi plays a young Roman who is obsessed with the United States. He seeks to imitate &lt;em&gt;gli Americani&lt;/em&gt; in his daily life, and one of the most well-known scenes sees him trading red wine for milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;By the time Celentano’s song came out, the sound of American English had been “contaminating” Italian culture for decades. Linguist Giuseppe Antonelli &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibs.it/ma-cosa-vuoi-che-sia-libro-generic-contributors/e/9788815134066&quot;&gt;analyzed Italian pop songs&lt;/a&gt; produced between 1958 and 2007, and revealed the ways in which Italian singers have incorporated American sounds into their music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;One way was to use intermittent English words, with preference for trendy terms. The most notable example of this is “Tu vuo’ fa l’americano” (“You Want to Be American”), a 1956 song by Renato Carosone about a young Neapolitan who is trying to impress a girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/51126/image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Italy's postwar fascination with American culture was captured by films such as 1954's &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;An American in Rome&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;. &quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-51126&quot;/&gt;Italy’s postwar fascination with American culture was captured by films such as 1954’s &lt;em&gt;An American in Rome&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Alberto_Sordi_-_scena_degli_spaghetti_-_Un_americano_a_Roma_(1954).jpg&quot;&gt;Public domain&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;The song, featured in the 1999 film &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUd-YP0Dt80&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Talented Mr. Ripley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, features mentions of “baseball,” “rock ‘n’ roll,” and “whiskey and soda,” which not only “sound American” but also evoke a kind of aspirational American lifestyle. Other songs alternated sentences in both languages, and still more, such as Bruno Martino’s 1959 “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8CaOLah9p4&quot;&gt;Kiss Me, Kiss Me&lt;/a&gt;,” were sung half in English and half in Italian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Similarly, in the 1960s there was a trend of bands in England singing in Italian—with strong English accents. Both phenomena resulted in a similar hybrid sound, one that Italians responded to. According to Francesco Ciabattoni, who teaches Italian culture and literature at Georgetown University, this Anglo-Italian pop genre grew from Italy’s collective interest in America, as well as the British Invasion of the 1960s. “I am not sure how much thinking they put in it, but producers must have realized that imitating English and American sounds would sell more,” he says. Linguistics may have played a role, too. “The phonetic structure of English makes it more suited to rock or pop songs compared with Italian,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/51134/image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Renato Carosone and his band in Milan in 1958. &quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-51134&quot;/&gt;Renato Carosone and his band in Milan in 1958. &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Renato_Carosone_and_his_band.JPG&quot;&gt;Public domain&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;“Rock or pop music is often arranged in ‘common time,’ a rhythmic pattern made of four beats with an emphasis on the second and fourth beat,” says Simone Lenzi, an Italian writer and frontman of Tuscan rock band &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.virginianamiller.it&quot;&gt;Virginiana Miller&lt;/a&gt;. “That pattern goes very well with the English language, which is mostly made of short and monosyllabic words that can easily be arranged on four beats.” Italian, on the other hand, is mostly made of longer words—only about 2 percent of the most-used words are monosyllabic—making it more suited to arias than rock or pop. For example, Tracy Chapman’s “You got a fast car” translates as “Tu hai una macchina veloce.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t to say that there’s not a wide range of popular music sung in Italian, but Celentano expressed his preference when he explained his creation to NPR. “So at a certain point, because I like American slang—which, for a singer, is much easier to sing than Italian—I thought that I would write a song which would only have as its theme the inability to communicate,” he said. “And to do this, I had to write a song where the lyrics didn’t mean anything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;baseline-grid-hr&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf section-break-graf&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;section-start-text&quot;&gt;But the roots of Celentano’s&lt;/span&gt; song go much further back than the end of World War II. “What Celentano is doing, inventing a nonsense language, was already done by Dante and by medieval comedians before him,” says Simone Marchesi, who teaches French and Italian medieval literature at Princeton University. And that practice, Marchesi explains, goes back even further, to the Old Testament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+11%3A1-9&quot;&gt;Genesis 11:1–9&lt;/a&gt; says that after the flood, the people of Earth, who all spoke the same language, founded the new city of Babel, and planned to build a tower tall enough to reach heaven. In reaction to this act of arrogance, God decided to confuse humans by creating different languages so that they could no longer understand each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/51145/image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;The Tower of Babel&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, Lucas van Valckenborch, 1594. &quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-51145&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tower of Babel&lt;/em&gt;, Lucas van Valckenborch, 1594. &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tour_de_babel.jpeg&quot;&gt;Public domain&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;And so, in Dante’s &lt;em&gt;Divine Comedy&lt;/em&gt;, the author encounters a giant named Nimrod next to the ninth circle of hell. In non-canonical writings, Nimrod is associated with building the Tower of Babel. He approaches Dante and Virgil, and says “Raphèl maí amècche zabí almi,” a series of words that has no meaning but, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dante.dartmouth.edu/search_view.php?cmd=prevresult&quot;&gt;according to some scholars&lt;/a&gt;, can sound a little like Old Hebrew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Virgil says, “every language is to him the same/as his to others—no one knows his tongue.” Nimrod speaks a failed language, and failed languages are the result of divine punishment. This is why, Marchesi explains, nonsense languages were traditionally associated with sin. “The medieval period was characterized by a division in ‘high’ aspects of life, associated with the heavens, and ‘low’ aspects associated with carnal, animal existence: the realm of sin.” For language, the high part was “signifiers”—the concepts that language conveys—and the low part was the “signs”—the sounds and symbols that represent those concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/51143/image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dante's &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Inferno&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; by Sandro Botticelli, 1480–90. &quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-51143&quot;/&gt;Dante’s &lt;em&gt;Inferno&lt;/em&gt; by Sandro Botticelli, 1480–90. &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerchi_dell%27Inferno#/media/File:Sandro_Botticelli_-_La_Carte_de_l%27Enfer.jpg&quot;&gt;Public domain&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;It then follows that purely ideal, divine language requires no sound, which is how the angels of the &lt;em&gt;Divine Comedy&lt;/em&gt; communicate. Lower language, on the other hand, would be rooted in the materiality of mortal sinners—pure sound. “And what happens when language becomes pure sound?” Marchesi says. “You need the body. It’s the language of mimics, it’s a language of performance.” Indeed, comedians and jesters in the Middle Ages resorted to invented sounds to tell bawdy, racy stories, and tales about hunger, disease, and other “low” subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;An example of this is Grammelot, a system of languages popularized by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/comm/hd_comm.htm&quot;&gt;Commedia dell’arte&lt;/a&gt;, a theatrical form that started in Italy in the 16th century and later spread around Europe. Grammelot was used by itinerant performers to “sound” like they were performing in a local language by a using macaronic and onomatopoeic elements together with mimicry and mime. Dario Fo, an Italian playwright and actor who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1997, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwDObANf1g&quot;&gt;featured Grammelot&lt;/a&gt; in his 1996 show &lt;em&gt;Mistero Buff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;o&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Comic Mystery Play&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;“Charlie Chaplin even did something like that,” Marchesi points out. The otherwise silent 1936 film &lt;em&gt;Modern Times&lt;/em&gt; sees the comedian performing a song that sounds like a mix of Italian and French, but means absolutely nothing. “He sings about love, one can make sense of it through the performance, even if sounds do not make sense,” Marchesi says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/0daS_SDCT_U&quot; width=&quot;860&quot; height=&quot;538&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;So a few millennia after Babel, a few centuries after Dante, and a few decades after Chaplin, Celentano offered his take on this classic performance trick. “When I first heard Celentano’s song I was very impressed by its ‘Americanness,’” says Arielle Saiber, a professor of Romance languages and literatures at Bowdoin College. “It notably emphasizes the American nasal, mumbling, drawn out sort of sounds … distinct from the clean ‘clip’ of British English or melodic Italian.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Indeed, it seems like Celentano followed the advice on Grammelot that Fo offered in his book &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2DLGyTq&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tricks of the Trade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;To perform a narrative in Grammelot, it is of decisive importance to have at your disposal a repertoire of the most familiar tonal and sound stereotypes of a language, and to establish clearly the rhythms and cadences of the language to which you wish to refer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/51271/image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Italian actor, playwright, and Nobel laureate Dario Fo. &quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-51271&quot;/&gt;Italian actor, playwright, and Nobel laureate Dario Fo. &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/michaeledwards/90814443/&quot;&gt;Michael Edwards/flickr&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;And Celentano certainly grasped the American rhythms and cadences of the 1960s. “Celentano captured stereotypical American sounds of that time, from movies and rock songs, much in the way that &lt;em&gt;comici dell’arte&lt;/em&gt;, comedians of Commedia dell’arte theater, in the 1600s imitated colloquial, regional language,” Saiber says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf item-body-last&quot;&gt;Of equal importance, Fo adds, is to inform the audience of what the Grammelot performance will be about. So in his 1972 television performance, Celentano introduces “Prisencolinensinainciusol” as the one word that can express universal love. If these rules are followed, Fo writes, the imaginary world created by the performer will make perfect sense for that audience in that time and place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, does prisencolinensinainciusol make any sense to you?&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Using high speed cameras, it’s possible to record the vibrations of everyday objects caused by nearby sounds and reverse engineer the sounds…&lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/consumer-electronics/audiovideo/your-candy-wrappers-are-listening&quot;&gt;essentially turning anything that vibrates into a speaker&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, if you want to know what a person is saying but can’t hear them directly, you can take a video of the house plant next to them and recover the sound from the micro-vibrations of the leaves. In one example, they filmed a pair of Apple earbuds playing a song and the recovered audio was accurate enough for the Shazam app to identify the song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group tested an eclectic selection of materials, including a bag of chips (excellent), a soda can (surprisingly mediocre), and a potted plant (average). They were even able to recreate music playing using footage of the vibrating ear buds. The best material of all was the thin foil wrapper on a Lindt chocolate bar Davis had been snacking on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst was a brick, which they intended to use for measuring experimental error. Even that “did better than we expected it to do,” says Davis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last demo is especially clever…they use &lt;a href=&quot;https://kottke.org/17/07/the-rolling-shutter-effect-explained&quot;&gt;the rolling shutter effect&lt;/a&gt; to essentially overclock the frame rate of regular 60fps video to recover nearby sounds. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>USAF Is Jamming GPS in Western U.S. For Largest Ever Red Flag Air War Exercise</title>

&lt;h2 class=&quot;dek&quot;&gt;The use of the mysterious jamming technology will impact the navigation of aircraft operating as far away from Nevada as Colorado. &lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;has-ad-column&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year's first iteration of the USAF's premier set of aerial war games, known commonly as &lt;a href=&quot;https://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/these-are-the-amazing-planes-of-this-years-red-flag-aer-1692329388&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Red Flag&lt;/a&gt;, is kicking off today at Nellis Air Force Base just outside of Las Vegas, but this exercise will be different than any in the past. Not only is it the largest of its kind in the exercise's 42 year history, but the USAF is going to blackout GPS over the sprawling &lt;a href=&quot;https://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/aggressor-air-controllers-display-clearly-shows-aircraf-1696453612&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nevada Test and Training Range&lt;/a&gt; to challenge aircrews and their weaponry under realistic fighting conditions. The tactic will spill over throughout the region, with warnings being posted stating inconsistent GPS service could be experienced by aircrews flying throughout the western United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disruptions will begin on January 26th and will run through February 16th. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flyingmag.com/upcoming-gps-outage-in-western-us-could-mean-back-to-basics&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flying.com reports&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The NBAA Command Center reports the U.S. military will begin training exercises on the Nevada Test and Training Range between 0400Z until 0700Z daily. Training maneuvers will impact vast portions of the Western U.S. including California, Nevada, Oregon, Wyoming, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Montana and New Mexico. FAA enroute ATC centers affected include Albuquerque (ZAB), Denver (ZDV), Los Angeles (ZLA), Salt Lake (ZLC), Oakland (ZOA) and Seattle (ZSE). Operations in R-2508 and R-2501 may also be impacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrivals and departures from airports within the Las Vegas area may be issued non-Rnav re-routes with the possibility of increased traffic disruption near LAS requiring airborne re-routes to the south and east of the affected area. Aircraft operating in Los Angeles (ZLA) center airspace may experience navigational disruption, including suspension of Descend-via and Climb-via procedures. Non-Rnav SIDs and STARs may be issued within ZLA airspace in the event of increased navigational disruption. Crews should expect the possibility of airborne mile-in-trail and departure mile-in-trail traffic management initiatives.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those dates and the location perfectly correspond with Red Flag 18-1. The timeframe for the daily disruptions is also the same as the night launch and recovery period for Red Flag this time of year. Two major large force employment missions take place every day during the exercise, one during the light and one during the night, with each last roughly two to three hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div itemprop=&quot;associatedMedia&quot; class=&quot;video-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;video-youtube__video&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gJWtaNcFzj4?rel=0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;has-ad-column&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular Red Flag includes players from the USAF, USMC, Australia and UK. The very limited guest list of only America's most trusted allies is indicative of a Red Flag exercise where high-end and sensitive capabilities will be put to the test. According to a press release from the USAF that was posted just hours ago, this seems to be an accurate assumption, with Colonel Michael Mathes, 414th Combat Training Squadron commander, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nellis.af.mil/News/Article/1420982/red-flag-18-1-takes-off-at-nellis/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;stating&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re trying a few new and different things with Red Flag 18-1... It’s the largest Red Flag ever with the largest number of participants, highlighting the balance of training efficiency with mission effectiveness... Red Flag 18-1 primarily is a strike package focused training venue that we integrate at a command and control level in support of joint task force operations... It’s a lot of words to say that we integrate every capability we can into strike operations that are flown out of Nellis Air Force Base.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPS denial is a becoming a huge issue for American military planners. Peer states, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/15194/russia-jammed-phones-and-gps-in-northern-europe-during-massive-military-drills&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;especially Russia&lt;/a&gt;, are already putting &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/13549/russia-may-be-testing-its-gps-spoofing-capabilities-around-the-black-sea?iid=sr-link1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GPS spoofing&lt;/a&gt; and jamming tactics to work during various training events near their own borders. We have discussed this situation in great depth before, and I would &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/17207/sr-71s-r2-d2-could-be-the-key-to-winning-future-fights-in-gps-denied-environments?iid=sr-link3&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;suggest you read this article&lt;/a&gt; to understand just how deeply the loss of reliable global positioning system data can mean for the U.S. and its allies during a time of war, as well as what is being done to overcome such a monumental hurdle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pentagon has mysteriously tested technology that can jam GPS over a wide area before, and it is likely that this same capability will be put to use in the Nellis Test and Training Range for this Red Flag 18-1. Line-of-sight and distance impact the way in which GPS users, especially other airplanes, operating far outside the training area will be affected. Here is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/3865/this-is-likely-why-the-navy-is-causing-a-massive-and-mysterious-gps-outage-in-the-western-us&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an article on those tests&lt;/a&gt;, which emanated from Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, which is located on the western edge of the Mojave Desert in California, in June of 2016. Below is a released image showing how line-of-sight impacts the jammer's abilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the Department of Defense is going to execute wide-spread GPS jamming operations during such a high-end exercise is more proof of just how big of a threat these emerging electronic warfare tactics pose. It will be interesting to see if the USAF admits that the technology was indeed used for Red Flag after the exercise concludes, but considering that there are a whole number of position, navigation, and timing (PNT) technologies being developed in hopes to help overcome the loss of GPS during combat, advisories like this one that occur during major military exercises will likely become increasingly normal in the years to come. &lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;I found a useful table with most of those in the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nostarch.com/howlinuxworks2&quot;&gt;How Linux Works&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; book that I'm currently reading, and some more on Stack Overflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you plan on using them, please bear in mind that these keyboard shorcuts depend on quite a number of things: the Unix distribution that you're using, your shell, your own configuration quirks... so YMMV.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Extensions in Firefox 59</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2018/01/26/extensions-firefox-59/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2018/01/26/extensions-firefox-59/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/&quot;&gt;Fire&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8370&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2018/01/firefox-logo-beta-160x160.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;160&quot; height=&quot;160&quot;/&gt;fox Quantum&lt;/a&gt; continues to make &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/01/firefoxs-continued-quantum-transformation-more-multithreading-tracking-protection/&quot;&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; as Mozilla incorporates even more &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/01/making-webassembly-even-faster-firefoxs-new-streaming-and-tiering-compiler/&quot;&gt;innovative technology&lt;/a&gt; into the platform. The development team behind the WebExtensions architecture is no exception, landing a slew of new API and improvements that can now be found in Firefox 59 (just released to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/channel/desktop/&quot;&gt;the Beta channel&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, documentation for the API discussed here can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions&quot;&gt;MDN Web Docs&lt;/a&gt; (some of the features below are just hitting the main branch as of this post, so if you don’t find the documentation on MDN, check back in a few days).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Experimental Tab Hiding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tab hiding is back! Since the deprecation of the legacy extension architecture, one of the most requested features has been the ability to hide tabs with the WebExtensions API. It was a key element of some very popular legacy add-ons that provided the ability to manage tab groups. Firefox 59 brings this capability back in an initial, experimental form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The API is very straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Include the “tabHide” permission in your manifest file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use tabs.hide() with the tab ID (or list of tab IDs) to hide tabs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use tabs.show() with the tab ID (or list of tab IDs) to show hidden tabs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examine the tabs.Tab.hidden field to determine if a tab is currently hidden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that the visible state of a tab is completely independent from its discarded state. While it may make sense to keep certain tabs active and loaded in memory while hidden, we encourage you to use tabs.discard() in combination with tabs.hide() to help manage memory and resource usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are certain restrictions when hiding tabs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tabs that are pinned cannot be hidden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tabs that are sharing their screen, microphone or camera cannot be hidden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The current active tab cannot be hidden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tabs that are in the process of being closed cannot be hidden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reintroduction of hidden tabs to Firefox does not come without some concern. A primary motivation for moving to the WebExtensions framework is to offer users a safer extension ecosystem that can be trusted to protect their security and privacy. Obviously, tab hiding opens the door for malicious extensions to hide tabs, doing things in the background without a user’s knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure we get things right, tab hiding is disabled by default. To enable the API, you must manually go to the about:config page and set extensions.webextensions.tabhide.enabled to true. This restriction will remain in place until:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additional user interface features are added to Firefox that allow users to see all of their hidden tabs and/or show those tabs independent of any extension. This user interface work is currently active and on-going.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers (internal and external) have had some time to try the API and understand its strengths and weaknesses. In particular, we want some time to gather input on the potential for abuse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, this API is currently &lt;strong&gt;experimental&lt;/strong&gt;. It could change, or even go away entirely if we can’t provide it in a secure manner.  Nevertheless, Firefox has a long, proud history of customization and the team is committed to upholding that tradition with tab hiding. So please give the API a try and see what you think. With your help, we will work to make tab hiding as fully functional as possible while still maintaining the security of the WebExtensions architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to jump right in a see what it’s like? Give the &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-hider/&quot;&gt;Tab Hider&lt;/a&gt; extension a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Additional Tab Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While tab hiding is the big feature to land in Firefox 59, it isn’t the only thing related to tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Even More Theme API&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing the “theme” of previous releases, Firefox 59 includes a number of additions to the Theme API that allow you to customize even more of the browser’s appearance, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Improvements to the webRequest API&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The webRequest API now &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1377689&quot;&gt;merges multiple headers with the same name&lt;/a&gt; rather than using only the last one. In addition, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1149250&quot;&gt;a couple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1418275&quot;&gt;of mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; were added to the webRequest API to allow for requests to be upgraded from HTTP to HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, to make debugging a lot easier, exceptions raised from a webRequest blocking listener now &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1428094&quot;&gt;report the original error message and filename&lt;/a&gt;. Below is an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_8371&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8371&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2018/01/Screenshot-2018-1-24-1428094-Exception-raised-from-a-webRequest-blocking-listener-BEFORE.png&quot; alt=&quot;Before Firefox 59&quot; width=&quot;811&quot; height=&quot;67&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2018/01/Screenshot-2018-1-24-1428094-Exception-raised-from-a-webRequest-blocking-listener-BEFORE.png 811w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2018/01/Screenshot-2018-1-24-1428094-Exception-raised-from-a-webRequest-blocking-listener-BEFORE-252x21.png 252w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2018/01/Screenshot-2018-1-24-1428094-Exception-raised-from-a-webRequest-blocking-listener-BEFORE-768x63.png 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2018/01/Screenshot-2018-1-24-1428094-Exception-raised-from-a-webRequest-blocking-listener-BEFORE-600x50.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 811px) 100vw, 811px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Before Firefox 59&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_8372&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8372&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2018/01/Screenshot-2018-1-24-1428094-Exception-raised-from-a-webRequest-blocking-listener-AFTER.png&quot; alt=&quot;Starting With Firefox 59&quot; width=&quot;817&quot; height=&quot;62&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2018/01/Screenshot-2018-1-24-1428094-Exception-raised-from-a-webRequest-blocking-listener-AFTER.png 817w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2018/01/Screenshot-2018-1-24-1428094-Exception-raised-from-a-webRequest-blocking-listener-AFTER-252x19.png 252w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2018/01/Screenshot-2018-1-24-1428094-Exception-raised-from-a-webRequest-blocking-listener-AFTER-768x58.png 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2018/01/Screenshot-2018-1-24-1428094-Exception-raised-from-a-webRequest-blocking-listener-AFTER-600x46.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Starting With Firefox 59&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Register Content Scripts at Runtime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another big feature landing with Firefox 59 is the ability to &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/contentScripts&quot;&gt;register content scripts&lt;/a&gt; at runtime. This is an important feature for extensions that want to support user scripting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the contentScripts.register() API, extensions can dynamically associate content scripts with different URLs, lifting the previous limitation that all content scripts had to be listed statically in the manifest file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Support for Decentralization Protocols&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla has always been a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/decentralization/&quot;&gt;proponent of decentralization&lt;/a&gt;, recognizing that it is a key ingredient of a healthy Internet. Starting with Firefox 59, several protocols that support decentralized architectures are available for use by extensions.  The newly approved protocols are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;browserAction and pageAction Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browser Actions and Page Actions are two of the most popular types of extensions that we see submitted to the Firefox &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/&quot;&gt;Add-Ons website&lt;/a&gt;.  Accordingly, the team behind WebExtensions continues to expand and improve the API for those types of extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;pageActions can now be &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/page_action&quot;&gt;shown and/or hidden automatically&lt;/a&gt; for specific pages via pattern matching using the “hide_matches” and “show_matches” manifest properties. This is a nice performance win for users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/browserAction#Functions&quot;&gt;browserAction set* methods can now accept a null value&lt;/a&gt; which removes the property from the browserAction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invalid badge background colors are &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1427107&quot;&gt;now rejected&lt;/a&gt; (provides more Chrome compatibility).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An extension can now &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1427431&quot;&gt;determine&lt;/a&gt; if its browserAction is enabled or disabled (browserAction.isEnabled), a pageAction is currently shown for a tab ( pageActions.isShown), and if its sidebarAction is currently open (sidebarAction.isOpen).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Enhancement to Cookies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability for extensions to control cookies in the browser expanded in Firefox 59, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Proxy Settings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extensions can now &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1425535&quot;&gt;override the proxy settings&lt;/a&gt; in the browser which has been another highly requested feature.  Using the browserSettings.proxyConfig.set() API, the following proxy settings can be controlled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;proxyType: The type of proxy to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;http: The address of the http proxy, can include a port.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;httpProxyAll: Use the http proxy server for all protocols.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ftp: The address of the ftp proxy, can include a port.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ssl: The address of the ssl proxy, can include a port.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;socks: The address of the socks proxy, can include a port.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;socksVersion: The version of the socks proxy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;passthrough: A list of hosts which should not be proxied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;autoConfigUrl: A URL to use to configure the proxy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;autoLogin: Do not prompt for authentication if password is saved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proxyDNS: Proxy DNS when using SOCKS v5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;User Notification of Extensions Overrides&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with previous releases, when functionality is provided via WebExtensions that allows extensions to control some aspect of the browser, Firefox will inform the user which extension controls that aspect and provide a way for them to regain control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability for an extension to control the browser’s tracking protection setting was added back in Firefox 57 via the websites.trackingProtectionMode API. Firefox 59 now shows when an extension controls tracking protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-8373&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2018/01/tracking-protection.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Tracking Protection Notification&quot; width=&quot;1261&quot; height=&quot;926&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above image, notice that a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1403751&quot;&gt;message is now displayed&lt;/a&gt; after a user disables an extension reminding them how to re-enable it, also a new feature of Firefox 59.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most popular browser defaults to override is the new tab page. Firefox already shows the user when an extension has overridden that page, but starting with Firefox 59 it also informs the user of the override on the first appearance of the new tab page itself. Plus, it is smart enough to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1414018&quot;&gt;revert back to the previous new tab&lt;/a&gt; if the new override is declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-8374&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2018/01/restore-settings-multiple.mov.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Restore New Tab&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;402&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Additional Browser Controls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better support mouse gestures, browserSettings.contextMenuShowEvent() has been added in this version. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1419426&quot;&gt;This new API&lt;/a&gt; can be set to “mouseup” or “mousedown” by extensions to determine when context menus should be shown. Note that this is not supported on Android, and also calling it with a value of “mousedown” on Windows is a no-op.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in Firefox 59, read-only browserSettings now &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1408472&quot;&gt;return false when calling set or clear&lt;/a&gt; and also report an accurate levelofControl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Context Menus for Bookmarks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of context menus, you can now set &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/menus/ContextType#Type&quot;&gt;custom context menus for bookmarks&lt;/a&gt;.  This will work on the bookmarks toolbar, the library menu, the bookmarks subview, and the bookmarks menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Development and Debugging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to suggest a new WebExtension API is to prototype it via an official experiment. Two major changes landed for WebExtension experiments that makes this significantly easier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in Firefox 59, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1429567&quot;&gt;more detail has been added to sandbox names&lt;/a&gt; to aid in debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous Changes and Fixes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of smaller items were also landed in the new Firefox 59 Beta, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More to Come&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox 59 landed a total of &lt;a href=&quot;https://mzl.la/2CJN9gE&quot;&gt;69 items&lt;/a&gt; for WebExtensions, the most important of which are discussed above. Thank you to everyone who had a part in getting it to Beta, especially volunteer contributors &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?login=andre%40andregarzia.com&quot;&gt;Andre Garzia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?login=ntim.bugs%40gmail.com&quot;&gt;Tim Nguyen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?login=oriol-bugzilla%40hotmail.com&quot;&gt;Oriol Brufau&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?login=javier--Lx3u0NnX4Eug3hq7uRufuMOjDIwrH7%40jasp.net&quot;&gt;Javier Serrano Polo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?login=kevinhowjones%40gmail.com&quot;&gt;Kevin Jones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?login=tushararora.cs%40gmail.com&quot;&gt;Tushar Arora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?login=martin%40humanoids.be&quot;&gt;Martin Giger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?login=psnyde2%40uic.edu&quot;&gt;Peter Snyder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?login=lukas.jung%40mailbox.org&quot;&gt;Lukas Jung&lt;/a&gt;. Additional changes and improvements to the WebExtensions API are already in progress for Firefox 60, so please continue to send us your feedback. And as always, thank you for using Firefox and helping ensure that individuals have the ability to shape the Internet and their own experiences on it.&lt;/p&gt;

De verdad, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Google?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@Google&lt;/a&gt;! Que leeches estáis haciendo con YouTube?? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/NzMUMlArJs&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/NzMUMlArJs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— ᛗ🦊ᛟErvoᛟ🦊ᛗ (@Mystic_Ervo) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Mystic_Ervo/status/956237422391709696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 24, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, researchers with antivirus provider Trend Micro said the ads helped drive a more than three-fold spike in Web miner detections. They said the attackers behind the ads were abusing Google's DoubleClick ad platform to display them to YouTube visitors in select countries, including Japan, France, Taiwan, Italy, and Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ads contain JavaScript that mines the digital coin known as Monero. In nine out of 10 cases, the ads will use publicly available JavaScript provided by Coinhive, a cryptocurrency-mining service that's controversial because it allows subscribers to profit by surreptitiously using other people's computers. The remaining 10 percent of the time, the YouTube ads use private mining JavaScript that saves the attackers the 30 percent cut Coinhive takes. Both scripts are programmed to consume 80 percent of a visitor's CPU, leaving just barely enough resources for it to function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;YouTube was likely targeted because users are typically on the site for an extended period of time,&quot; independent security researcher &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bad_packets&quot;&gt;Troy Mursch&lt;/a&gt; told Ars. &quot;This is a prime target for cryptojacking malware, because the longer the users are mining for cryptocurrency the more money is made.&quot; Mursch said a &lt;a href=&quot;https://badpackets.net/coinhive-miner-found-on-official-showtime-network-websites-in-latest-case-of-cryptojacking//&quot;&gt;campaign from September&lt;/a&gt; that used the Showtime website to deliver cryptocurrency-mining ads is another example of attackers targeting a video site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add insult to injury, the malicious JavaScript in at least some cases was accompanied by graphics that displayed ads for fake AV programs, which scam people out of money and often install malware when they are run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ad.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;250&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above ad was posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://vozforums.com/showpost.php?p=135399393&amp;amp;postcount=31&quot;&gt;on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. Like the ads analyzed by Trend Micro and posted on social media, it mined Monero coins on behalf of someone with the Coinhive site key of &quot;h7axC8ytzLJhIxxvIHMeC0Iw0SPoDwCK.&quot; It's not possible to know how many coins the user has generated so far. Trend Micro said the campaign started January 18. In an e-mail sent as this post was going live, a Google representative wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mining cryptocurrency through ads is a relatively new form of abuse that violates our &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/6020954?hl=en&quot;&gt;policies&lt;/a&gt; and one that we’ve been monitoring actively. We enforce our policies through a multi-layered detection system across our platforms which we update as new threats emerge. In this case, the ads were blocked in less than two hours and the malicious actors were quickly removed from our platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn't clear what the representative meant when saying the ads were blocked in less than two hours. Evidence supplied by Trend Micro and on social media showed various ads containing substantially the same JavaScript ran for as long as a week. The representative didn't respond to follow-up questions seeking a timeline of when the abusive ads started and ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
As the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/11/drive-by-cryptomining-that-drains-cpus-picks-up-steam-with-aid-of-2500-sites/&quot;&gt;problem of Web-based cryptomining has surged&lt;/a&gt; to almost epidemic proportions, a variety of AV programs have started warning of cryptocurrency-mining scripts hosted on websites and giving users the option of blocking the activity. While drive-by cryptocurrency mining is an abuse that drains visitors' electricity and computing resources, there's no indication that it installs ransomware or other types of malware, as long as people don't click on malicious downloads.

<title>You Can’t Fire Equifax, but Your Employer Can</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/your-money/equifax-breach.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/your-money/equifax-breach.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;655&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2186&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;Even after Equifax disclosed the big breach in the fall, sloppy practices continued. I tip my cap to the reader who somehow ended up on a long list of recipients of an urgent email and spreadsheet from inside Equifax, which I now have, too. It warned of “inappropriate access” across several company systems and a “lack of an adequate review of operating system and database credentials.” This reader is not an Equifax employee but ended up on the distribution list anyway, where recipients were asked to mark terminated employees in red, presumably so they wouldn’t have access to internal systems anymore. Equifax said that it was inadvertent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;396&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2582&quot;&gt;Now, a bit about this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theworknumber.com/Employees/Why/Verifications.asp&quot;&gt;Work Number&lt;/a&gt; service that The Times will no longer be using. At its most basic level, it helps employers avoid all of the phone calls they get asking to verify someone’s current or past employment and salary. Generally, if you give, say, a landlord or a lender permission to check your salary, they are free to contact your employer. Work Number helps automate the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;342&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2924&quot;&gt;Lots of employers use it. Equifax claims that more than 5,500 have signed up, including over 75 percent of Fortune 500 companies and many federal agencies. The service works by setting up a sort of central line to your employer’s payroll operation, uploading your paycheck information each period. It &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theworknumber.com/samples/voi.pdf&quot;&gt;also records&lt;/a&gt; your job title and tenure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;340&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3264&quot;&gt;As you might guess, this information has a lot of value to outsiders. As long as those entities comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, they can generally gain access to it if you’ve given them permission. (You might have done this years ago, without even realizing it, when you signed up for a credit card or other financial service.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;440&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3704&quot;&gt;If lenders want an early warning that you’ve been fired or demoted, Equifax’s Work Number service can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theworknumber.com/products/Select.pdf&quot;&gt;hand one over&lt;/a&gt;. “This critical and timely information will maximize your efficiency on credit risk and collections decisions,” the company promises lenders. Armed with information about what you’re making or if you’re no longer working, they can turn up the heat on efforts to get you to pay or reduce credit lines accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;281&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3985&quot;&gt;Equifax can also use the payroll data to help colleges track the financial progress of its alumni with its “Graduate Outcome Metrics” offering, allowing schools to avoid expensive surveys and what Equifax &lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.equifax.com/assets/wfs/equifaxGraduateOutcomeMetrics_ps.pdf&quot;&gt;refers to&lt;/a&gt; in its marketing materials as “self-reporting falsehoods.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;314&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4299&quot;&gt;And if your mind wandered to where mine did in imagining other Work Number uses, yes — employers can and do ask for job applicants’ permission to check their current and previous salary &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bna.com/ask-salary-history-n73014470106/&quot;&gt;where it is legal&lt;/a&gt; to do that. So fibbing about your past compensation in hopes of securing a raise may not work out so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;story-ad-2&quot; class=&quot;story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent&quot;&gt;

&lt;a class=&quot;visually-hidden skip-to-text-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/your-money/equifax-breach.html#story-continues-4&quot;&gt;Continue reading the main story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;285&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4584&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;Speaking of falsehoods, I found something that looked like one on my own Work Number report. (You can get yours free on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theworknumber.com/Employees/DataReport/&quot;&gt;Equifax’s website&lt;/a&gt; the same way you would a normal credit report.) It said that in June 2017, Discover Financial Services was able to dive into my Work Number data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;371&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4955&quot;&gt;But unless I’m forgetting some long-ago dalliance, I’ve never had a relationship with that company. So why — and how — has it been able to pry? I figured this was a mistake; credit reports tend to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2015/01/ftc-issues-follow-study-credit-report-accuracy&quot;&gt;lots of errors&lt;/a&gt;, after all. Equifax suggested &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theworknumber.com/Employees/employee-data-dispute/index.asp&quot;&gt;disputing the item&lt;/a&gt; online through its normal process. Discover was unable to offer up an explanation by my deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;438&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5393&quot;&gt;In the wake of the payroll unit breach that Mr. Krebs reported on, which resulted from thieves using personal information from affected employees to reset their passwords, the University of Louisville stopped doing business with the Equifax service. Another company, the building material manufacturer Saint-Gobain Corporation, made a different call in the moment and kept Equifax while also starting an examination of competing services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;305&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5698&quot;&gt;Erickson Living, a retirement community operator, also continued doing business with Equifax, while adding additional security measures and shutting down online access to W-2s. The aerospace and defense company Northrop Grumman declined to say what it did, and Mark Root, a spokesman, declined to say why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;114&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5812&quot;&gt;(Equifax said that the number of Work Number employee records it handles had increased over the past four months.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;200&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6012&quot;&gt;Here at The Times, we gave Equifax 90 days’ notice of termination of our Work Number contract on Thursday. According to a Times spokeswoman, Eileen Murphy, an evaluation of alternatives is underway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;232&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6244&quot;&gt;For those who may consider airing concerns with their own employer, I sought out the advice of my friend Bob Sullivan, who shined some of the brightest, earliest light on Equifax’s Work Number service through &lt;a href=&quot;https://bobsullivan.net/archive/archive-exclusive-your-employer-may-share-your-salary-and-equifax-might-sell-that-data/&quot;&gt;reporting of his own&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;265&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6509&quot;&gt;He suggested making two points in particular. The primary one is the basic security argument about Equifax. “They can’t be trusted with data, and they’ve proven that over and over again,” said Mr. Sullivan, who is also the author of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://bobsullivan.net/gotchas/ten-years-later-the-gotchas-are-back-and-so-is-my-book-with-all-new-advice-for-2018/&quot;&gt;Gotcha Capitalism&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;294&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6803&quot;&gt;There is also the matter of internal communications, given that most employees (including me, until recently) have no idea whom their employers are working with. “If all employees understood that every single pay stub was going to Equifax every week, there would be a mini-revolt,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;visually-hidden skip-to-text-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/your-money/equifax-breach.html#whats-next&quot;&gt;Continue reading the main story&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Mozilla Is Hiring a Developer to Work on Thunderbird Full-Time</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/thunderbird/2018/01/were-hiring-a-developer-to-work-on-thunderbird-full-time/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/thunderbird/2018/01/were-hiring-a-developer-to-work-on-thunderbird-full-time/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Thunderbird Project is hiring for a software engineer! We’re looking for an amazing developer to come on board to help make Thunderbird the best Email client on the planet! If you are interested you can apply via the link below, following the job description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the job description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title: Thunderbird Software Engineer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Thunderbird&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thunderbird is a email client depended on daily by 25 million people on&lt;br/&gt;three platforms: Windows, Mac and Linux (and other *nix). It was developed by the Mozilla Corporation until 2014 when development was handed over to the community. The Mozilla Foundation is now the fiscal home of Thunderbird. The Thunderbird Council, who lead the community effort, has begun hiring contractors through Mozilla in support of this venture and to guarantee that all vital services are provided in a reliable fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will join the team that is leading Thunderbird into a bright future. As a software engineer you will be maintaining and improving the existing Gecko-based Thunderbird but also pave the way for its transition to being based on web technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Thunderbird team works openly using public bug trackers and repositories, providing you with a premier chance to showcase your work to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Contract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Thunderbird project is looking to hire software engineers to help maintain Thunderbird. You’ll be expected to work with community volunteers, the Thunderbird Council, and other employees to maintain and improve the Thunderbird product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a remote, hourly 6-month contract. Hours will be up to 40 a week. You will be expected to have excellent written communication skills and coordinate your work over email, IRC, and Bugzilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a software engineer for Thunderbird you will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Fix bugs and regressions and address technical debt.&lt;br/&gt;* In collaboration with Thunderbird’s Engineering Steering Committee,&lt;br/&gt;replace/rewrite modules to prepare Thunderbird for the transition to a&lt;br/&gt;new platform.&lt;br/&gt;* Maintain and improve Thunderbird to ensure that both nightly builds&lt;br/&gt;and releases are always possible.&lt;br/&gt;* Follow improvements made by Mozilla engineers for the Firefox platform&lt;br/&gt;process and implement those for Thunderbird.&lt;br/&gt;* Be a self-starter. In a large code-base it’s inevitable that you&lt;br/&gt;conduct your own research, investigation and debugging, although others&lt;br/&gt;in the project will of course share their knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;* Work with both volunteers and employees across the world to fix issues.&lt;br/&gt;* Collaborate with QA, Security, Localization, and Release Engineering&lt;br/&gt;for coordinated code releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Previous Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since we are looking to fill one or more positions, we are interested to&lt;br/&gt;hear from junior and senior candidates who can offer the following:&lt;br/&gt;* Solid knowledge and experience developing a large software system (7+&lt;br/&gt;million lines of code).&lt;br/&gt;* Solid knowledge of C++ as well as JavaScript, HTML and CSS.&lt;br/&gt;* Ideally exposure to the Mozilla platform as a voluntary contributor or&lt;br/&gt;add-on author with knowledge of XPCOM, XUL, etc.&lt;br/&gt;* Some experience using distributed version control systems (preferably&lt;br/&gt;Mercurial, Git would be acceptable).&lt;br/&gt;* Some prior exposure to Python and build systems (preferably make)&lt;br/&gt;would be beneficial.&lt;br/&gt;* Experience developing software cross-platform applications is a plus.&lt;br/&gt;* B.S. in Computer Science would be lovely, but real-world experience is&lt;br/&gt;preferred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If this position sounds like a good fit for you, please send us your resume with a cover letter to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:apply@mozillafoundation.org&quot;&gt;apply@mozillafoundation.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cover letter is essential to your application, as it shows us how you envision Thunderbird’s technical future. Tell us about why you’re passionate about Thunderbird and this position. Also include samples of your work as a programmer, either directly or a link. If you contribute to any open source software, or maintain a blog we’d love to hear about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that while the Thunderbird project is a group of individuals separate from the Mozilla Foundation that works to further the Thunderbird email client, the Mozilla Foundation is the Project’s fiscal home. The Thunderbird Council, separate from Mozilla, manages the Project and will direct the software engineer’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The successful applicant will be hired as freelancer (independent contractor) through the Mozilla Foundation’s third-party service Upwork (www.upwork.com). By applying to this job, you are agreeing to have your applications reviewed by Thunderbird contractors and volunteers who are a part of the hiring committee as well as by staff members of the Mozilla Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla values diversity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.&lt;/p&gt;

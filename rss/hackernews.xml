<title>EFF&amp;#039;s Fight to End Warrantless Device Searches at the Border</title>
<link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/01/round-effs-advocacy-against-border-device-searches</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/01/round-effs-advocacy-against-border-device-searches</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;EFF has been working on multiple fronts to end a widespread violation of digital liberty—warrantless searches of travelers’ electronic devices at the border. Government policies allow border agents to search and confiscate our cell phones, tablets, and laptops at airports and border crossings for no reason, without explanation or any suspicion of wrongdoing. It’s as if our First and Fourth Amendment rights don’t exist at the border. This is wrong, which is why we’re working to challenge and end these unconstitutional practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EFF and the ACLU &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-and-aclu-ask-court-allow-legal-challenge-proceed-against-warrantless-searches&quot;&gt;filed a brief today&lt;/a&gt; in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cases/alasaad-v-duke&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alasaad v. Nielsen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; lawsuit to oppose the government’s attempt to dismiss our case. Our lawsuit, filed in September 2017 on behalf of 11 Americans whose devices were searched, takes direct aim at the illegal policies enforced by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and its component agencies, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). In our brief we explain that warrantless searches of electronic devices at the border violate the First and Fourth Amendments, and that our 11 clients have every right to bring this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just the latest action we’ve taken in the fight for digital rights at the border. EFF is pushing back against the government’s invasive practices on three distinct fronts: litigation, legislation, and public education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Rampant Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years there has been a dramatic increase in the number of searches of cell phones and other electronic devices conducted by border agents. CBP reported that in fiscal year 2012 the number of border device searches was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/qfr-kevin-mcaleenan-senate-finance-committee&quot;&gt;5,085&lt;/a&gt;. In fiscal year 2017, the number had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/cbp-releases-updated-border-search-electronic-device-directive-and&quot;&gt;increased to 30,200&lt;/a&gt;—a six-fold increase in just five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DHS claims the authority to ransack travelers’ cell phones and other devices and the massive troves of highly personal information they contain. ICE agents can do so for any reason or no reason. Under a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/01/new-cbp-border-device-search-policy-still-permits-unconstitutional-searches&quot;&gt;new policy issued earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, CBP agents can do so without a warrant or probable cause, and usually can do so without even reasonable suspicion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, agents can and do confiscate devices for lengthy periods of time and subject them to extensive examination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These practices are unconstitutional invasions of our privacy and free speech. Our electronic devices contain our emails, text messages, photos and browsing history. They document our travel patterns, shopping habits, and reading preferences. They expose our love lives, health conditions, and religious and political beliefs. They reveal whom we know and associate with. Warrantless device searches at the border violate travelers’ rights to privacy under the Fourth Amendment, and freedoms of speech, press, private association, and anonymity under the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These practices &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/13/technology/aclu-border-patrol-lawsuit.html&quot;&gt;have existed&lt;/a&gt; at least since the George W. Bush administration and continued through the Obama administration. But given the recent dramatic uptick in the number of border device searches since President Trump took office, a former DHS chief privacy officer, Mary Ellen Callahan, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/american-citizens-u-s-border-agents-can-search-your-cellphone-n732746&quot;&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; that the increase was “clearly a conscious strategy,” and not “happenstance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the U.S. border is not a Constitution-free zone. The Fourth Amendment requires the government to obtain a probable cause warrant before conducting a border search of a traveler’s electronic device. This follows from the U.S. Supreme Court case &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/riley-wurie-supreme-court-opinions&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Riley v. California&lt;/em&gt; (2014)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The court held that police need a warrant to search the cell phones of people they arrest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warrant process is critical because it provides a check on government power and, specifically, a restraint on arbitrary invasions of privacy. In seeking a warrant, a government agent must provide sworn testimony before a neutral arbiter—a judge—asserting why the government believes there’s some likelihood (“probable cause”) that the cell phone or other thing to be searched contains evidence of criminality. If the judge is convinced, she will issue the search warrant, allowing the government to access your private information even if you don’t consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, there are no such constraints on CBP and ICE agents—but we’re fighting in court and in Congress to change this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Litigation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 13, 2017, EFF along with ACLU filed our lawsuit, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-aclu-media-conference-call-today-announce-lawsuit-over-warrantless-phone-and&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alasaad v. Nielsen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, against the federal government on behalf of ten U.S. citizens and one lawful permanent resident whose smartphones and other devices were searched without a warrant at the U.S. border. The plaintiffs include a military veteran, journalists, students, an artist, a NASA engineer, and a business owner. Several are Muslims or people of color. All were reentering the country after business or personal travel when border agents searched their devices. None were subsequently accused of any wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the &lt;em&gt;Alasaad&lt;/em&gt; plaintiffs suffered a substantial privacy invasion. Some plaintiffs were detained for several hours while agents searched their devices, while others had their devices confiscated and were not told when their belongings would be returned. One plaintiff was even placed in a chokehold after he refused to hand over his phone. You can read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/pages/alasaad-vs-duke-bios&quot;&gt;detailed stories&lt;/a&gt; of all the &lt;em&gt;Alasaad&lt;/em&gt; plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Alasaad&lt;/em&gt; lawsuit, we are asking the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts to find that the policies of CBP and ICE violate the Fourth Amendment. We also allege that the search policies violate the First Amendment. We are asking the court to enjoin the federal government from searching electronic devices at the border without first obtaining a warrant supported by probable cause, and from confiscating devices for lengthy periods without probable cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past year, EFF also has filed three &lt;em&gt;amicus&lt;/em&gt; briefs in U.S. Courts of Appeals (in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/us-v-kolsuz-eff-amicus-brief&quot;&gt;Fourth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/us-v-molina-isidoro-eff-brief&quot;&gt;Fifth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/files/2018/01/19/17_eff_amicus_brief_usa_v_cano_1.19.18.pdf&quot;&gt;Ninth&lt;/a&gt; Circuits). In those briefs, we argued that border agents need a probable cause warrant to search electronic devices. There are extremely strong and unprecedented privacy interests in the highly sensitive information stored and accessible on electronic devices, and the narrow purposes of the border search exception—immigration and customs enforcement—are not served by warrantless searches of electronic data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legislation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EFF is urging the U.S. Congress to pass the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wyden.senate.gov/download/?id=9CDE0A37-24DD-4D05-B199-C7E160CAA088&amp;amp;download=1&quot;&gt;Protecting Data at the Border Act&lt;/a&gt;. The Act would require border agents to obtain a probable cause warrant before searching the electronic devices of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents at the border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate bill (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/823?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22protecting+data+at+the+border+act%22%5D%7D&amp;amp;r=4&quot;&gt;S. 823&lt;/a&gt;) is sponsored by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY). &lt;a href=&quot;https://adamsmith.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/smith-and-polis-introduce-legislation-to-protect-data-privacy-civil&quot;&gt;Rep. Polis (D-CO), Rep. Smith (D-WA), and Rep. Farenthold (R-TX)&lt;/a&gt; are taking the lead on the House bill (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1899?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22protecting+data+at+the+border+act%22%5D%7D&amp;amp;r=5&quot;&gt;H.R. 1899&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to creating a warrant requirement, the Act would prohibit the government from delaying or denying entry or exit to a U.S. person based on that person’s refusal to hand over a device passcode, online account login credential, or social media handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read more about this critical bill in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/04/border-search-bill-would-rein-cbp&quot;&gt;call to action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; and our &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/homeland-security/352898-pass-the-protecting-data-at-the-border-act&quot;&gt;op-ed in &lt;em&gt;The Hill&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Please &lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/demand-border-agents-get-a-warrant-before-digital-searches-f3b58af9-e71d-4b7c-b5ae-52d89c70b912&quot;&gt;contact your representatives in Congress&lt;/a&gt; and urge them to co-sponsor the Protecting Data at the Border Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Education&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, EFF published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/wp/digital-privacy-us-border-2017&quot;&gt;travel guide&lt;/a&gt; that helps travelers understand their individual risks when crossing the U.S. border (which includes U.S. airports if flying from overseas), provides an overview of the law around border searches, and offers technical guidance for securing digital data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our travel guide recognizes that one size does not fit all, and it helps travelers make informed choices regarding their specific situation and risk tolerance. The guide is a useful resource for all travelers who want to keep their digital data safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download our full report &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/files/2017/03/10/digital-privacy-border-2017-guide3.10.17.pdf&quot;&gt;as a PDF&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, you can print &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/eff-border-search-pocket-guide&quot;&gt;EFF’s pocket guide&lt;/a&gt; to protecting digital privacy at the border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;So Coinbase's disastrous customer service has come up on HN before [1]. But my issue is rather more extreme than a wire transfer that takes a few weeks to go through - I've been waiting for over &lt;em&gt;five months&lt;/em&gt; for Coinbase to unlock my account and allow me to access my funds. Since August 20 of 2017 to be exact.
&lt;p&gt;I've never experienced or even heard of such a long wait time for action to be taken on an open customer support ticket and I honestly have no idea how to proceed. Should I start contacting the CFPB or BBB, writing registered letters, etc?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I have had contact with various Coinbase customer service reps since August. I also have tried emailing and tweeting at the CEO and Coinbase executives. The refrain is always the same: &quot;We're expanding fast and adding to our customer service team. Your case has been escalated for further review. Please bear with us.&quot; I've been patient for months now and am thinking that maybe I'm not following the right strategy - any advice?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Software Complexity Is Killing Us</title>
<link>https://www.simplethread.com/software-complexity-killing-us/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.simplethread.com/software-complexity-killing-us/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Since the dawn of time (before software, there was only darkness), there has been one constant: businesses want to build software cheaper and faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is certainly an understandable and laudable goal – especially if you’ve spent any time around software developers. It is a goal that every engineer should support wholeheartedly, and we should always strive to create things as efficiently as possible, given the constraints of our situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the truth is we often don’t. It’s not intentional, but over time, we get waylaid by unforeseen complexities in building software and train ourselves to seek out edge cases, analysis gaps, all of the hidden repercussions that can result from a single bullet point of requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get enthralled by the maelstrom of complexity and the mental puzzle of engineering elegant solutions: Another layer of abstraction! DRY it up! Separate the concerns! Composition over inheritance! This too is understandable, but in the process, we often lose sight of the business problems being solved and forget that managing complexity is the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;second most important&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; responsibility of software developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how did we get here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few decades, our industry has been very successful at reducing the amount of custom code it takes to write most software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of this reduction has been accomplished by making programming languages more expressive. Languages such as Python, Ruby, or JavaScript can take &lt;em&gt;as little as one third as much code&lt;/em&gt; as C in order to implement similar functionality. C gave us similar advantages over writing in assembler. Looking forward to the future, it is unlikely that language design will give us the same kinds of improvements we have seen over the last few decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But reducing the amount of code it takes to build software involves many other avenues that don’t require making languages more expressive. By far the biggest gain we have made in this over the last two decades is open source software (OSS). Without individuals and companies pouring money into software that they give freely to the community, much of what we build today wouldn’t be possible without an order of magnitude more cost and effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These projects have allowed us to tackle problems by standing on the shoulders of giants, leveraging tools to allow us to focus more of our energy on actually solving business problems, rather than spending time building infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, businesses are complex. Ridiculously complex and only getting moreso. OSS is great for producing frameworks and tools that we can use to build systems on top of, but for the most part, OSS has to tackle problems shared by a large number of people in order to gain traction. Because of that, most open source projects have to either be relatively generic or be in a very popular niche. Therefore, most of these tools are great platforms on which to build out systems, but at the end of the day, we are still left to build all of the business logic and interfaces in our increasingly complex and demanding systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what we are left with is a stack that looks something like this (for a web application)…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;Our Code&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;Libraries&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;Web Framework&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;Web Server&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;Data Stores&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;Operating System&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That “Our Code” part ends up being enormously complex, since it mirrors the business and its processes. If we have custom business logic, and custom processes, then we are left to build the interfaces, workflow, and logic that make up our applications. Sure, we can try to find different ways of recording that logic (remember business rules engines?), but at the end of the day, no one else is going to write the business logic for your business. There really doesn’t seem to be a way around that… at least not until the robots come and save us all from having to do any work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if we have to develop the interfaces, workflow, and logic that make up our applications, then it sounds like we are stuck, right? To a certain extent, yes, but we have a few options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To most developers, software equals code, but that isn’t reality. There are many ways to build software, and one of those ways is through using visual tools. Before the web, visual development and RAD tools had a much bigger place in the market. Tools like PowerBuilder, Visual Foxpro, Delphi, VB, and Access all had visual design capabilities that allowed developers to create interfaces without typing out any code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tools spanned the spectrum in terms of the amount of code you needed to write, but in general, you designed your app visually and then ended up writing a ton of code to implement the logic of your app. In many cases you still ended up programmatically manipulating the interface, since interfaces built using these tools often ended up being very static. However, for a huge class of applications, these tools allowed enormous productivity gains over the alternatives, mostly at the cost of flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of these tools might have waned since the web took over, but companies’ desire for them has not, especially since the inexorable march of software demand continues. The latest trend that is blowing across the industry is “low code” systems. Low code development tools are a modern term put on the latest generation of drag and drop software development tools. The biggest difference between these tools and their brethren from years past is that they are now mostly web (and mobile) based and are often hosted platforms in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And many companies are jumping all over these platforms. Vendors like Salesforce (App Cloud), Outsystems, Mendix, or Kony are promising the ability to create applications many times faster than “traditional” application development. While many of their claims are probably hyperbole, there likely is a bit of truth to them as well. For all of the downsides of depending on platforms like these, they probably do result in certain types of applications being built faster than traditional enterprise projects using .NET or Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, a few things. First is that experienced developers often hate these tools. Most Serious Developers™ like to write Real Software™ with Real Code™. I know that might sound like I’m pandering to a bunch of whiney babies (and maybe I am a bit), but if the core value you deliver is technology, it is rarely a good idea to adopt tools that your best developers don’t want to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second is that folks like me look at these walled platforms and say “nope, not building my application in there.” That is a legitimate concern and the one that bothers me the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you built an application a decade ago with PHP, then that application might be showing its age, but it could still be humming along right now just fine. The language and ecosystem are open source, and maintained by the community. You’ll need to keep your application up to date, but you won’t have to worry about a vendor deciding it isn’t worth their time to support you anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…folks like me look at these walled platforms and say “nope, not building my application in there.” That is a legitimate concern and the one that bothers me the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you picked a vendor 10 years ago who had a locked down platform, then you might be forced into a rewrite if they shut down or change their tooling too much (&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/30/facebooks-parse-developer-platform-is-shutting-down-today/&quot;&gt;remember Parse?&lt;/a&gt;). Or even worse, your system gets stuck on a platforms that freezes and no longer serves your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons to be wary of these types of platforms, but for many businesses, the allure of creating software with less effort is just too much to pass up. The complexity of software continues on, and software engineers unfortunately aren’t doing ourselves any favors here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are productive platforms out there, that allow us to build Real Software™ with Real Code™, but unfortunately our industry right now is far too worried with following the lead of the big tech giants to realize that sometimes their tools don’t add a lot of value to our projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t tell you the number of times I’ve had a developer tell me that building something as a single page application (SPA) adds no overhead versus just rendering HTML. I’ve heard developers say that every application should be written on top of a NoSQL datastore, and that relational databases are dead. I’ve heard developers question why every application isn’t written using CQRS and Event Sourcing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is that kind of thought process and default overhead that is leading companies to conclude that software development is just too expensive. You might say, “But event sourcing is so elegant! Having a SPA on top of microservices is so clean!” Sure, it can be, but not when you’re the person writing all ten microservices. It is that kind of additional complexity that is often &lt;em&gt;so unnecessary&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, as an industry, need to find ways to simplify the process of building software, without ignoring the legitimate complexities of businesses. We need to admit that not every application out there needs the same level of interface sophistication and operational scalability as Gmail. There is a whole world of apps out there that need well thought-out interfaces, complicated logic, solid architectures, smooth workflows, etc…. but don’t need microservices or AI or chatbots or NoSQL or Redux or Kafka or Containers or whatever the tool dujour is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of developers right now seem to be so obsessed with the technical wizardry of it all that they can’t step back and ask themselves if any of this is really needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is like the person on MasterChef who comes in and sells themselves as the molecular gastronomist. They separate ingredients into their constituent parts, use scientific methods of pairing flavors, and then apply copious amounts of CO2 and liquid nitrogen to produce the most creative foods you’ve ever seen. And then they get kicked off after an episode or two because they forget the core tenet of most cooking, that food needs to taste good. They seem genuinely surprised that no one liked their fermented fennel and mango-essence pearls served over cod with anchovy foam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our obsession with flexibility, composability, and cleverness is causing us a lot of pain and pushing companies away from the platforms and tools that we love. I’m not saying those tools I listed above don’t add value somewhere; they arose in response to real pain points, albeit typically problems encountered by large companies operating systems at enormous scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I’m saying is that we need to head back in the direction of simplicity and start actually creating things in a simpler way, instead of just constantly talking about simplicity. Maybe we can lean on more &lt;em&gt;integrated&lt;/em&gt; tech stacks to provide out of the box patterns and tools to allow software developers to create software more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…we are going to push more and more businesses into the arms of “low code” platforms and other tools that promise to reduce the cost of software by dumbing it down and removing the parts that brought us to it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to stop pretending that our 20th line-of-business application is some unique tapestry that needs to be carefully hand-sewn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After writing that, I can already hear a million developers sharpening their pitchforks, but I believe that if we keep pushing in the direction of wanting to write everything, configure everything, compose everything, use the same stack for every scale of problem, then we are going to push more and more businesses into the arms of “low code” platforms and other tools that promise to reduce the cost of software by dumbing it down and removing the parts that brought us to it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our answer to the growing complexity of doing business cannot be adding complexity to the development process – no matter how elegant it may seem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must find ways to manage complexity by simplifying the development process. Because even though managing complexity is our second most important responsibility, we must always remember the most important responsibility of software developers: delivering value through working software.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Software Complexity Is Killing Us - Simple Thread</og:title>
<og:description>Since the dawn of time (before software, there was only darkness), there has been one constant: businesses want to build software cheaper and faster. It is certainly an understandable and laudable goal – especially if you’ve spent any time around software developers. It is a goal that every engineer should support wholeheartedly, and we should...

<title>The U.S. Gets Less Subway for Its Money Than Its Peers</title>

&lt;p class=&quot;l-article__dek o-small-container&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;It’s not just the Second Avenue Subway: Nearly all urban rail projects in the U.S. cost much more than their European counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-1&quot; readability=&quot;84.689218523878&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late December, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; published a bombshell article by Brian Rosenthal about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/nyregion/new-york-subway-construction-costs.html&quot;&gt;high construction costs on the New York City subway&lt;/a&gt;. Doing painstaking investigative work building on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pedestrianobservations.com/2011/05/16/us-rail-construction-costs/&quot;&gt;a set of numbers I blogged about in 2011&lt;/a&gt;, Rosenthal showed how, at $2.6 billion per mile, New York’s Second Avenue Subway broke records for its costs, and that all of the reasons subway officials offered were excuses. The article documented poor contracting practices, bad management, and union featherbedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/thisiscitylab&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/01/Facebook_Injector/2af933f8b.png&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, what Rosenthal portrays as a New York affliction is in fact a nationwide problem. The construction costs of American rail transit are a multiple of such costs in peer countries, for both subways and light-rail lines. Many U.S. lines that would be easy to justify economically if they cost as much as in France or Sweden are marginal at current American costs. Every city that hopes to expand its transit network should pay closer attention to best industry practices abroad if it wants its investments to be cost-effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much does rail cost?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approximate range of underground rail construction costs in continental Europe and Japan is between $100 million per mile, at the lowest end, and $1 billion at the highest. Most subway lines cluster in the range of $200 million to $500 million per mile; in Amsterdam, a six-mile subway line &lt;a href=&quot;https://nltimes.nl/2017/04/06/first-full-speed-full-length-test-new-amsterdam-subway-ends-successfully&quot;&gt;cost 3.1 billion Euros&lt;/a&gt;, or about $4 billion, after severe cost overruns, delays, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.railjournal.com/index.php/metros/amsterdam-north-south-line-construction-completed.html&quot;&gt;damage to nearby buildings&lt;/a&gt;. The Second Avenue Subway is unique even in the U.S. for its exceptionally high cost, but elsewhere, the picture is grim by European standards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is hard to find exact international comparisons for subway lines running in the medians of freeways. However, it should not be much more difficult to construct such lines than to build light rail. Indeed, in the study for Atlanta’s I-20 East extension, there are options for light rail and bus rapid transit, and the light rail option is only slightly cheaper than the heavy rail option, at $140 million per mile.&lt;/p&gt;

The cheaper lines cost about $40 million per mile, the more expensive ones about $100 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, most recent and in-progress light-rail lines cost more than $100 million per mile. Two light-rail extensions in Minneapolis, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://metrocouncil.org/Transportation/Projects/Current-Projects/METRO-Blue-Line-Extension/Publications-And-Resources/Project-Facts/BLRT-Project-Facts.aspx&quot;&gt;Blue Line Extension&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://metrocouncil.org/Transportation/Projects/Current-Projects/Southwest-LRT.aspx&quot;&gt;Southwest LRT&lt;/a&gt;, cost $120 million and $130 million per mile, respectively. Dallas’ Orange Line light rail, 14 miles long, cost somewhere between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ipd/project_profiles/tx_dart.aspx&quot;&gt;$1.3 billion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/an-absurd-transit-duplication-in-dallas&quot;&gt;$1.8 billion&lt;/a&gt;. Portland’s Orange Line &lt;a href=&quot;https://trimet.org/history/orangeline/index.htm&quot;&gt;cost about $200 million per mile&lt;/a&gt;. Houston’s Green and Purple Lines together cost &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/transportation/article/More-trouble-for-rail-lines-as-opening-pushed-to-5762844.php&quot;&gt;$1.3 billion&lt;/a&gt; for about 10 miles of light rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-3&quot; readability=&quot;87.725252525253&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a handful of American lines come in cheaper than $100 million per mile, the upper limit for French light rail: For example, a light-rail extension in suburban Phoenix was recently built for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.valleymetro.org/sites/default/files/legacy-images/uploads/prop_photos/CME_ProjectFactSheer_LRT1948_12_5.pdf&quot;&gt;$65 million per mile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending $900 million per mile on a subway, or $150 million per mile on light rail, may not seem so outrageous compared to New York’s $2.6 billion per-mile subway. But there’s no reason why building subways and light rail in sprawling cities should be as expensive as it is. In Manhattan, the population density and utilities around Second Avenue make it comparable to Paris, London, Berlin, and other older cities with large subway systems that have complex tunnel networks. But San Jose has wide roads and little in the way of older infrastructure, so it is better to compare it with suburban tunnels in Europe, which come near the low end of construction costs. Among the American subway tunnels recently opened or under construction, only the Central Subway in San Francisco, passing deep under the two-level Market Street Subway, has a reason to be costly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Stockholm, construction costs are generally low, but among its &lt;a href=&quot;http://nyatunnelbanan.sll.se/sites/tunnelbanan/files/Faktablad_Upphandling_%20engelsk.pdf&quot;&gt;ongoing subway extensions&lt;/a&gt;, the most suburban one (Barkarby) is the cheapest at about $150 million per mile; an extension underwater (to Nacka) is about $220 million per mile, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20150402164159/http:/www.trafikverket.se/en/startpage/Projects/Railway-construction-projects1/The-Stockholm-City-Line/&quot;&gt;deep commuter rail tunnel under the city center&lt;/a&gt; is about $400 million per mile. Based on the difference in costs within Stockholm, it is likely that if other American cities built a project as complex as the Second Avenue Subway, they would find themselves facing the same costs as the Second Avenue Subway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost per rider&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost-per-mile metric is useful in measuring a city’s ability to build infrastructure efficiently. However, by itself, it does not reveal whether rail investments are socially or economically justified. In order to decide how cost-effective investment is, cities must compare costs with benefits—in this case, ridership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-4&quot; readability=&quot;83.714685314685&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In New York, the Second Avenue Subway, which is only two miles long, is estimated to eventually see 200,000 trips per day, and so far, it seems to be on track to achieving its ridership projection. This is a high figure, achievable only in very dense neighborhoods. The Second Avenue Subway serves segments of the Upper East Side that have among the highest population-density levels in the developed world. With such high intensity of usage, the new line is projected to cost $25,000 per daily rider. The cost-per-rider range for European subways seems to be $10,000 to $25,000, so the Second Avenue Subway is not even an outlier: Its extreme cost is balanced by very high ridership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in other American cities, there is no hope of balancing high cost with ridership in the same way. Even relatively old cities such as Boston and San Francisco have extensive suburban sprawl, and no neighborhood as dense as the Upper East Side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas the Second Avenue Subway will cost about $25,000 per rider if it meets projections, Los Angeles’ Purple Line &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesource.metro.net/2014/11/10/long-wait-is-over-groundbreaking-ceremony-today-for-subway-extension-under-wilshire-boulevard/&quot;&gt;is expected to carry 150,000 riders&lt;/a&gt; across its three phases (and some of this ridership comes from preexisting rather than new stations), which will come out to about $45,000 per rider. Boston’s Green Line Extension is projected to get &lt;a href=&quot;http://greenlineextension.eot.state.ma.us/documents/about/FactSheets/GreenLineEXTFactSheet_F_web.pdf&quot;&gt;52,000 daily riders&lt;/a&gt;, making it about $45,000 per rider as well. But many American light-rail lines have per-rider costs approaching $100,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-5&quot; readability=&quot;54.276923076923&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Parisian tramways, which combine very high ridership and reasonable (though not low) costs, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2010/01/19/paris-officials-push-huge-suburban-transit-investment-to-increase-metropolitan-mobility/&quot;&gt;are almost all cheaper than $10,000 per rider&lt;/a&gt;, with many around $5,000. Parisian Metro extensions are more expensive, clustering around $10,000 per rider; these balance higher investment costs with lower operating costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-6&quot; readability=&quot;75.312855517634&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Second Avenue Subway would be unbelievably cheap to build in Europe. Other American lines would not be so cheap, but they could still be justifiable, with costs per rider that fall within the European range. The budgets that American cities currently devote to the odd line could fund entire networks of light rail and subway lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are costs so high?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his exposé, Rosenthal talked about labor problems: severe overstaffing, with some workers doing jobs that are no longer necessary, and wages well into six figures. These issues are not exclusive to New York. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.michaelbradydesign.com/Transfer/ACEC%20files/Megaprojects/MP_Ch12.pdf&quot;&gt;chapter in a textbook&lt;/a&gt; about megaproject construction states that “as a result of existing union agreements covering the eastern seaboard area of the United States, underground construction employs approximately four times the number of personnel as in similar jobs in Asia, Australia, or Europe.” European subway construction uses union labor, just like American construction, but the work rules that have accumulated over the decades permit higher productivity and fewer workers doing each task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the problems are not just to do with labor. Working alongside active commuter or intercity rail lines brings a slew of new requirements and regulations. The Green Line Extension is notable for running in a trench next to a commuter rail line, and several Boston-area rail activists told me that a key reason for its high cost is that construction is not permitted to disturb commuter rail service. Another light rail line running alongside commuter rail and Amtrak, San Diego’s Mid-Coast Trolley extension, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/government/change-rein-costs-wildly-expensive-mid-coast-trolley-project/&quot;&gt;costs $2.1 billion for 11 miles&lt;/a&gt;; by contrast, &lt;a href=&quot;http://voiceofsandiego.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/50cbd67885fbd.pdf.pdf&quot;&gt;other light rail projects on San Diego’s wishlist&lt;/a&gt; are projected to cost less, about $100 million per mile in 2010 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-7&quot; readability=&quot;75.894255874674&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In California, the quality of contractors is to blame for some problems. The &lt;em&gt;San Diego Union Tribune&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/watchdog/sdut-ron-tutor-addressess-high-speed-rail-criticism-2013apr16-htmlstory.html&quot;&gt;ran an article in 2013&lt;/a&gt; focusing on Tutor Perini, which has a pattern of submitting low bids to win public construction contracts but then running over because of change orders and courtroom battles, contributing to an average 40-percent cost overrun in the San Francisco Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California’s contractor problem does not seem to be a national one. Jaime Garmendia, a manager at Boston’s MBTA, said, “We would cease to do business with that contractor in a heartbeat.” He put the Green Line Extension’s high cost down to poor project management. Recent changes to the Green Line Extension support that diagnosis. After the transit agency fired the contractor and hired a new general manager to oversee the project, it reduced the budget to $2.3 billion from a previous $3 billion. Of the $2.3 billion price tag, only $1.1 billion is for actual construction, whereas much of the rest is sunk cost is due to the botched earlier version of the extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the solution?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly all American urban rail projects cost much more than their European counterparts do. The cheaper ones cost twice as much, and the more expensive ones about seven times as much. The reasons for this are varied: Some arise from the character of the project (unique regulations related to commuter rail), some from state rules (California’s problem with contractors), and some from poor project management (Boston’s Green Line Extension).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;c-related-content u-full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;c-related-content__title&quot;&gt;Recommended&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-8&quot; readability=&quot;67&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these problems are solvable upon a careful review of what it takes to build a new subway or light-rail line. Boston’s experience in limiting its cost overrun is instructive, and could prove to be a model for other cities. Modernizing work rules to avoid having many redundant employees, as described in detail in Rosenthal's investigation, could also provide savings. If cities overstaff tunnel construction by a factor of four, they could hire the same number of workers to build four times as much tunnel and devote the cost savings to further infrastructure improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States is not doomed to ineffective transit investment. Since many of these problems affect some cities but not others, there is scope for cities to learn best practices from each other. Additionally, the U.S. can look at what other rich countries (such as France and Sweden) do and copy what works. There is no iron curtain between the United States and Western Europe—learning good rail-project management and procurement is well within the grasp of a large urban transit agency. All it takes is the understanding that things are better abroad, and a willingness to learn and do better.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>My new favorite book of all time</title>
<link>https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Enlightenment-Now</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Enlightenment-Now</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;For years, I’ve been saying Steven Pinker’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/The-Better-Angels-of-Our-Nature&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Better Angels of Our Nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was the best book I’d read in a decade. If I could recommend just one book for anyone to pick up, that was it. Pinker uses meticulous research to argue that we are living in the most peaceful time in human history. I’d never seen such a clear explanation of progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to stop talking up &lt;em&gt;Better Angels&lt;/em&gt; so much, because Pinker has managed to top himself. His new book, &lt;em&gt;Enlightenment Now&lt;/em&gt;, is even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ABVVDSgihYs?rel=0&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enlightenment Now&lt;/em&gt; takes the approach he uses in &lt;em&gt;Better Angels&lt;/em&gt; to track violence throughout history and applies it to 15 different measures of progress (like quality of life, knowledge, and safety). The result is a holistic picture of how and why the world is getting better. It’s like &lt;em&gt;Better Angels&lt;/em&gt; on steroids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pinker was generous enough to send me an early copy, even though &lt;em&gt;Enlightenment Now&lt;/em&gt; won’t be released until the end of February. I read the book slowly since I loved it so much, but I think most people will find it a quick and accessible read. He manages to share a ton of information in a way that’s compelling, memorable, and easy to digest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It opens with an argument in favor of returning to the ideals of the Enlightenment—an era when reason, science, and humanism were touted as the highest virtues. (Gates Notes Insiders can get a preview of this section of the book.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m all for more reason, science, and humanism, but what I found most interesting were the 15 chapters exploring each measure of progress. Pinker is at his best when he analyzes historic trends and uses data to put the past into context. I was already familiar with a lot of the information he shares—especially about health and energy—but he understands each subject so deeply that he’s able to articulate his case in a way that feels fresh and new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love how he’s willing to dive deep into primary data sources and pull out unexpected signs of progress. I tend to point to things like dramatic reductions in poverty and childhood deaths, because I think they’re such a good measure of how we’re doing as a society. Pinker covers those areas, but he also looks at more obscure topics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are five of my favorite facts from the book that show how the world is improving:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re 37 times less likely to be killed by a bolt of lightning than you were at the turn of the century&lt;/strong&gt;—and that’s not because there are fewer thunderstorms today. It’s because we have better weather prediction capabilities, improved safety education, and more people living in cities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time spent doing laundry fell from 11.5 hours a week in 1920 to an hour and a half in 2014.&lt;/strong&gt; This might sound trivial in the grand scheme of progress. But the rise of the washing machine has improved quality of life by freeing up time for people—mostly women—to enjoy other pursuits. That time represents nearly half a day every week that could be used for everything from binge-watching &lt;em&gt;Ozark&lt;/em&gt; or reading a book to starting a new business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re way less likely to die on the job.&lt;/strong&gt; Every year, 5,000 people die from occupational accidents in the U.S. But in 1929—when our population was less than two-fifths the size it is today—20,000 people died on the job. People back then viewed deadly workplace accidents as part of the cost of doing business. Today, we know better, and we’ve engineered ways to build things without putting nearly as many lives at risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The global average IQ score is rising by about 3 IQ points every decade.&lt;/strong&gt; Kids’ brains are developing more fully thanks to improved nutrition and a cleaner environment. Pinker also credits more analytical thinking in and out of the classroom. Think about how many symbols you interpret every time you check your phone’s home screen or look at a subway map. Our world today encourages abstract thought from a young age, and it’s making us smarter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;War is illegal.&lt;/strong&gt; This idea seems obvious. But before the creation of the United Nations in 1945, no institution had the power to stop countries from going to war with each other. Although there have been some exceptions, the threat of international sanctions and intervention has proven to be an effective deterrent to wars between nations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pinker also tackles the disconnect between actual progress and the perception of progress—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Some-Good-News-For-Once&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;something I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about&lt;/a&gt;. People all over the world are living longer, healthier, and happier lives, so why do so many think things are getting worse? Why do we gloss over positive news stories and fixate on the negative ones? He does a good job explaining why we’re drawn to pessimism and how that instinct influences our approach to the world, although I wish he went more in depth about the psychology (especially since he’s a psychologist by training). The late Hans Rosling explains this more fully in his excellent new book &lt;em&gt;Factfulness&lt;/em&gt;, which I plan to review soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with Pinker on most areas, but I think he’s a bit too optimistic about artificial intelligence. He’s quick to dismiss the idea of robots overthrowing their human creators. While I don’t think we’re in danger of a &lt;em&gt;Terminator-&lt;/em&gt;style scenario, the question underlying that fear—who exactly controls the robots?—is a valid one. We’re not there yet, but at some point, who has AI and who controls it will be an important issue for global institutions to address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big questions surrounding automation are proof that progress can be a messy, sticky thing—but that doesn’t mean we’re headed in the wrong direction. At the end of &lt;em&gt;Enlightenment Now&lt;/em&gt;, Pinker argues that “we will never have a perfect world, and it would be dangerous to seek one. But there is no limit to the betterments we can attain if we continue to apply knowledge to enhance human flourishing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; getting better, even if it doesn’t always feel that way. I’m glad we have brilliant thinkers like Steven Pinker to help us see the big picture. &lt;em&gt;Enlightenment Now&lt;/em&gt; is not only the best book Pinker’s ever written. It’s my new favorite book of all time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plunging cost of storage, along with that of wind and solar power, appears to have crossed a new threshold after a tender conducted by a major US energy utility suggests “firm and dispatchable” renewables are now cheaper than existing coal plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4340162-Xcel-Solicitation-Report.html&quot;&gt;stunning revelation came from Xcel Energy in Colorado,&lt;/a&gt; and quietly released over the Christmas/New Year break, although some outlets like Vox and Carbon Tracker were quick to pick up on the significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, XCel Energy put out a “request for proposals” (RFP) for how it could replace two coal-fired generators that it is considering shutting down – part of a plan that will take its share of renewables to more than 50 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were described by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/1/16/16895594/colorado-renewable-energy-future&quot;&gt;Vox’s David Roberts as “mind-blowing”&lt;/a&gt;. And he’s not wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://reneweconomy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-29-at-10.33.11-AM.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-105853&quot; src=&quot;http://reneweconomy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-29-at-10.33.11-AM-590x358.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;549&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; srcset=&quot;http://reneweconomy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-29-at-10.33.11-AM-590x358.png 590w, http://reneweconomy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-29-at-10.33.11-AM-300x182.png 300w, http://reneweconomy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-29-at-10.33.11-AM.png 778w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The median bid price for projects proposing a mix of wind plus battery storage was just $US21/MWh ($A25.80/MWh), while the median price for solar plus battery storage projects was just $US36/MWh ($A44.30/MWh).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The graph above comes from the XCel documents. The areas blacked out were done by the utility for reasons of commercial in confidence).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And these prices do not represent just a few one-off, left field offers. All told, there were more than 100 bids combining wind and solar, or both, with battery storage, and 20 gigawatts of such capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “median” means that half the bids were cheaper than the median price cited above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.carbontracker.org/colorados-renewables-revolution/&quot;&gt;to Carbon Tracker,&lt;/a&gt; these are the lowest renewables plus battery storage bids in the US to date, and most likely anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The median bid for wind plus storage appears to be lower than the operating cost of all coal plants currently in Colorado, while the median solar plus storage bid could be lower than 74 per cent of operating coal capacity,” it noted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.carbontracker.org/colorados-renewables-revolution/&quot;&gt;in a report earlier this month.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.carbontracker.org/colorados-renewables-revolution/&quot;&gt;(See graph below. This shows that the operating cost of the cheapest coal plants in Colorado is just below $US40/MWh, rising to more than $40/MWh and then soaring beyond $100/MWh for the most expensive units)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://reneweconomy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-29-at-12.15.45-PM.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-105854&quot; src=&quot;http://reneweconomy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-29-at-12.15.45-PM-590x356.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;547&quot; height=&quot;330&quot; srcset=&quot;http://reneweconomy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-29-at-12.15.45-PM-590x356.png 590w, http://reneweconomy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-29-at-12.15.45-PM-300x181.png 300w, http://reneweconomy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-29-at-12.15.45-PM.png 755w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 547px) 100vw, 547px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The significance of the tender result is the small additional cost of storage – between $US3 and $US7/MWh. This is less than half the $US15/MWh priced in the previous lowest bid – $US45/MWh for solar and storage in a bid &lt;a href=&quot;http://reneweconomy.com.au/stunning-new-lows-in-solar-and-battery-storage-costs-13929/&quot;&gt;accepted by Tucson Energy&lt;/a&gt; easier last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of wind without storage was $18/MWh, while the cost of solar without storage was $29/MWh – both prices benefit from federal tax incentives, and would likely be around $US25/MWh and $US40/MWh without them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The significance for Australia is enormous. The battery storage sector has only just commenced, but the potential is clearly huge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://reneweconomy.com.au/tesla-big-battery-moves-from-show-boating-to-money-making-93955/&quot;&gt;Tesla big battery in South Australia&lt;/a&gt; since its launch in early December has created great interest, and caused many to think how the operations of the electricity grid may be completely rethought and redesigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tesla big battery will be joined by numerous other battery storage installations in a relatively short time – smaller battery arrays in Alice Springs and near Cooktown in Queensland are due to come on soon, as will another battery at the Wattle Point wind farm in South Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be followed by three new battery storage arrays in Victoria, another in the Northern Territory, at least two more in South Australia (Lincoln Gap and Whyalla) and numerous other potential projects in Queensland and NSW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was interesting that Franck Woitiez, the head of Neoen Australia which operates the Tesla big battery adjacent to its Hornsdale wind farm, last week spoke of the huge pipeline of solar projects in NSW – more than 2,000MW – that could readily adopt battery storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woitiez noted how quickly the 150MW &lt;a href=&quot;http://reneweconomy.com.au/neoen-starts-on-150mw-solar-plant-in-nsw-just-a-year-from-initial-idea-52444/&quot;&gt;Coleambally solar project in western NSW&lt;/a&gt; will be delivered – &lt;a href=&quot;http://reneweconomy.com.au/neoen-starts-on-150mw-solar-plant-in-nsw-just-a-year-from-initial-idea-52444/&quot;&gt;less than two years after the project was first conceived&lt;/a&gt; – and said large scale solar and storage could be delivered in half the time, and at a much lower cost, than the massive Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US tender bears that out. Wind, solar and storage costs in the US tend to be cheaper than in Australia, partly due to the lower cost of finance, the lower cost of labour, and the depth of the industry there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Xcel tender results are just part of story that illustrates the plunging cost of wind, solar, and battery storage. Bids of below $US20/MWh for solar projects have now been delivered in both Saudi Arabia and Mexico, and storage is matching predictions that its cost profile will be similar to solar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://reneweconomy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-29-at-12.44.01-PM.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright wp-image-105855 size-full&quot; src=&quot;http://reneweconomy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-29-at-12.44.01-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;192&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Xcel tender elicited bids for stand alone battery storage with a media price of $US11/MWh, with storage ranging from&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Vox’s Roberts notes, a company called ViZn Energy Systems, which uses flow batteries rather than lithium-ion, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/record-low-solar-plus-storage-price-in-xcel-solicitation&quot;&gt;promising&lt;/a&gt; $US27/MWh solar+storage by 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is lower than many predictions for solar alone. When the Tucson bid results were announced, it was considered to be a death knell for the market for new gas plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Danny Kennedy, formerly on Sungevity and now head of the California Clean Energy Fund, has noted, both GE and Siemens have taken an axe to their once enormous gas generation units because of the massive slump in orders because renewables and storage are beating out gas plant in tenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the cost of wind or solar plus storage is beating out existing coal, that takes the market transition to a whole new dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;header readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With apologies to Elon Musk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I dedicate this piece to my father who introduced me to world of waves when I was four by teaching me how to rebuild Ducati engines and to my mother who revealed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zachaysan.com/writing/2018-01-23-the-world-of-bits&quot;&gt;world of bits&lt;/a&gt; when I was six by demonstrating how to alter QBasic computer games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is geared towards people with a STEM background. For something shorter try &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weeklystandard.com/terrorists-could-use-teslas-to-kill-us/article/2011171&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; in The Weekly Standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With cyber security the first thing to understand is that the internet is ungovernable because locality is irrelevant and identity shroudable. This is by design—it's &lt;em&gt;the internet&lt;/em&gt;—we're all supposed to be able to talk to everyone and it wasn't designed at the protocol level to require payment or identification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyber criminals make mistakes and are occasionally arrested, but attacks often originate within states that do not cooperate with international institutions or foreign governments. As a result, even the most competitive startups and technology companies capitulate to ransom demands when compromised; rather than rely on protection or action of law enforcement. In places outside of the developed world there is less of a distinction between private individuals and state actors. A software security expert can work to enrich herself or a criminal enterprise one day, and work for her governments intelligence service the next. This makes international cooperation less tenable with adversaries or unaligned states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second thing to recognize about cyber security is that attack is a thousand times easier than defense. Attackers can probe from multiple points, like previously hacked computers or from servers rented with stolen credit card information, patiently trying different strategies until they succeed. Especially talented attackers may first invent a new method of attack then write software to scan servers or internet traffic to create a prioritized list of potentially vulnerable organizations before systematically breaching them. Like burglars scoping a neighborhood before trying their new approach on many domiciles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A defender, on the other hand, is a sitting target. Her application is public facing; with URLs, domains, and data centers that anyone can investigate. A consistent, detectable set of operating systems, software languages, and libraries that are as well understood by potential adversaries as they are by the team that is responsible for the software that uses them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It only takes a single entry point incorrectly secured to allow inadvertent public access. Defending all entry points and permanently keeping them defended, despite changing organizational requirements, personnel, and a never ending stream of vulnerability updates to software libraries; is nigh on impossible. Even organizations that have the technical competence and resources to defend against persistent attack, like the NSA, are one insider away from critical breach or exfiltration. Think Edward Snowden or Chelsea Manning. The stakes are high, the attack surface huge, and the threat persistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a system is breached, a sufficiently prepared attacker can use pre-written software to accomplish their prioritized objectives. For example, malware may exfiltrate password lists and cryptographic keys first, and later collect information like purchasing history. Once an attacker begins to suspect that their activities have not gone unnoticed they can resort to encrypting the compromised server's hard drives before ransoming them back to their owners. Welcome to the cyberpunk future: it's stranger and less dingy than promised, but hackers have panicked organizations scrambling to pay cryptocurrency ransoms. It's strange to admit publicly, but I'm one of the people that gets called because of my early involvement in crytpocurrencies and long history of responsible vulnerability disclosure. Attackers: Please understand that due to the public nature of this website, I no longer personally hold cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;System administrators and software developers, the primary people responsible for defending our software enabled devices, are invisible until a breach occurs. Since organizations do not observe an attacker's failure, the market generally does not reward extreme competence in cyber defense. The best paid and most well known people in cyber security are generally known for their public disclosures or exploits, and rarely for the bulk of their quiet work: making sure standard issues are continuously monitored and addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackhats, in stark contrast, are sexy. They seem to come out of nowhere. They disrupt events and enact their will to a degree that would otherwise be disproportionate to their resources. Look no further than the Clinton email breach to see how much a single hacker can change the world. The power of a talented software expert is growing every day. In terms of electoral votes per person-hour worked, door-to-door canvassing pales in comparison to cyber attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the most dedicated defenders have an Achilles's heel: Previously undisclosed software exploits. These are known as 0days to experts due to the lack of notice. Attackers utilizing these weaknesses can breach systems regardless of the care or knowledge of the software developers involved. A competent defender's confidence in code or agents is a spectrum ranging from untrustworthy to highly trusted. They don't ever trust completely; which conflicts with rapid software development and deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heartbleed, a security hole in a widely used library called OpenSSL, caused a number of organizations online to panic as system administrators rushed to patch in advance of a breach. The most prepared either immediately disconnected their servers or waited to see signs that an attack was ongoing through utilization of network monitoring tools; only removing their computers from the internet once the vulnerability transitioned to an ongoing attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Hayden former US Air Force General and Director of both the NSA and CIA has these comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The cyber domain of war] is characterized by great speed and great maneuverability, so it favors the offense. It is inherently global. It is inherently strategic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survival of the agent and its persistence as a command and control platform for payload delivery depend on its ability to hide, morph and masquerade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third thing to understand about cyber security is that certain classes of cyber attack, including most 0days, can break all instances of the same system at the same time. For example, while it would take two separate missiles to destroy two separate predator drones, a single software vulnerability found in both of them can be exploited for a cyber attack to breach and disable both simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how WannaCry was able to infect hundreds of thousand computers, including life saving machines used by hospitals in the UK. Bombs from the world of bits don't have yields measured the attributes of their identity, like mass or explosive power, they have yields measured by the attributes of the world around them. The number of vulnerable targets, their network connectivity, the privileges they operate under, and the additional access to other devices they provide. Their usefulness is a function of the target's exposure, much like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incendiary_device&quot;&gt;incendiary devices&lt;/a&gt; used during the Second World War.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are countermeasures at a defender's disposal, but they aren't perfect and in the arms race between attack and defense, they're harder to build, deploy, and for non-technical organizations to evaluate. Even armed with the best tools, dedicated operators still don't win every single time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one advantage that defenders have is that most software experts do not want to work for criminal gangs or to get involved with corrupt, illiberal states. But the cyberarms market is growing and nation states like Saudi Arabia pay millions for certain classes of vulnerabilities. Money talks. Burner computers and cryptocurrencies enable the otherwise timid to sell their discoveries without worrying about potential blackmailers getting their face or fingerprints; though only the truly careful evade NSA detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The internet is anarchy. It is difficult to attribute attacks and even when it is possible, public disclosure reveals sources and methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyber defense is extremely difficult and underappreciated, especially over time as organizations change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some classes of cyber attack allow control of all instances of a device and, with the right pre-planning, can prevent access to the device owner once breached.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reliance on conventional deterrence, like bombing a cyber criminal's house, is politically difficult. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-missile-intelligence.html&quot;&gt;Intelligence isn't perfect&lt;/a&gt;. Malware can destroy or alter itself and attacks can be staged to implicate uninvolved third parties. Attacks can even be inadvertently launched due to errors made during exploit development. A malware developer can accidentally program a bug into their virus, they can unintentionally connect a test computer to the internet, they can even have their virus launched due to the presence of third party malware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For deterrence to be effective it must be not only credible, it must threaten rational actors who have full control of their resources. Software experts are no different than the public in their capacity for derangement or extreme ideological persuasion. Even if western intelligence agencies were omniscient and had perfect, provable attribution that didn't leak sources and methods, deterrence against all terrorist cells and cyber activists would still be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reacting during an attack is difficult because the communication systems that run the internet move data at roughly the speed of light. A server in Austin, Texas takes about 140 milliseconds to send data to a server in Tokyo, Japan. An ICBM traveling the same distance takes almost a million times longer in travel time alone. Attacks originating from compromised computer components can be measured in &lt;em&gt;microseconds&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the use of methods like automated network monitoring, unsophisticated attacks can be automatically mitigated. Servers can be powered off or disconnected from the internet, but reliance on human judgment during an attack isn't feasible and disconnecting or shutting down devices may not always be possible since compromised devices can disengage themselves from remote control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hacked phone, for example, may have its network code updated to pass all information through a server controlled by the assailant. Without countermeasures enacted ahead of time by the phone manufacturer, instructions to update the phone's vulnerable software can be automatically blocked. Failure to plan for the worst or other missteps by a defender may result in a permanently compromised device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010 Sergey Ulasen of VirusBlokAda discovered Stuxnet, a virus believed to be written in a joint collaboration between Israel and the United States to disrupt the Iranian nuclear weapons program. Though the Iranians took steps to ensure that their nuclear material processing devices were not connected to the internet, the virus was able to breach them by hopping onto USB keys. Once the malware had taken hold, it subtly altered instrumentation to destroy centrifuges without revealing its presence. It was a watershed moment that I recall disbelieving upon first learning of its existence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It sounds way too Hollywood to be true.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn't until I'd read through the code myself that I finally believed that it had actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuxnet taught the cyber security community two things: First, viruses aren't just intelligence tools—they're weapons of war. Second, whether or not a computer is internet connected is just another area of trust for competent defender: More of a continuum than a binary fact. The Iranian weapons program can be &lt;em&gt;pretty dark&lt;/em&gt; but still let in USB keys and a Twitter profile can be &lt;em&gt;white hot&lt;/em&gt; but still go offline occasionally; and data can be exfiltrated through a multitude of methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every single electrical and radiological device can be utilized to transmit data. What's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baud&quot;&gt;baud&lt;/a&gt; of opening and closing HVAC vents and reading them from space satellites?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to advances in AI, data can be analyzed and filtered locally so low bandwidth or high latency methods of communication aren't the barriers that they once were. For example, an adversary can employ voice-to-text on an organization's internal videos and only exfiltrate those that mention keywords critical to research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaspersky Lab, the research group that uncovered Stuxnet to the public, has recently been classified by the United States Department of Homeland Security as likely having ties to the Russian FSB, the post-Soviet replacement of the KGB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past twenty years a multitude of everyday devices have turned into computers. Fridges are now computers. Watches are now computers. Even things like one time use sensors to ensure correct concrete hardening are computers. Cars are computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a cyber security breach at very reputable company I was working with years ago I asked myself: If even we can't keep personal data secure, how are these automotive companies doing it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/&quot;&gt;Jeep got hacked&lt;/a&gt; and had to ship millions of USB sticks to patch the automotive software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaguely vindicated that there wasn't some special secret to securing computers that they knew that we didn't, I also felt uneasy. If hacking a Jeep is as straightforward as hacking a server, and servers are routinely breached, then where are all the hacked cars? It's a bit like the Fermi Paradox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explanation is likely a mix of things. It may not occur to most security researchers that they could be just as effective hacking cars as they could hacking servers or workstations. There may be a lack of motivation by assailants capable of breaching these devices, since they may be used to corporate espionage contracts where buyers buy information, not control. They may also have trouble turning security techniques that work for servers or personal computers to cars because the attack surface is smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though unlikely, the answer could also be more sinister. Just as Uber quietly paid off their attacker, automotive companies could be quietly doing the same. Public companies may need to publish audited financial statements, but they don't have to report on the scope of nature of their cyber breaches. If VW &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal&quot;&gt;acted unfaithfully&lt;/a&gt; to circumvent pollution regulations, why should we trust them to responsibly warn us about the growing nature of this threat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I think we've overloaded the word security. It's used to indicate both a feeling as well as a reality. One person can feel safe, but actually be in grave danger, while another can feel terrified even though they're under no risk of calamity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structural engineers limit how much deflection a beam or causeway undergo during expected load not because the deflections themselves are necessarily unsafe, but because they expect people to reliably report when things feel wrong and if large but otherwise safe deflections are routine, then large but unsafe deflections will go unreported. Structural engineers also use more conservative designs when systems cannot exhibit visible weakness before failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computers hit with sophisticated malware show no sign of infection. Even if an attack requires multiple stages or intermediary computers—as the Stuxnet virus did—carefully written malware is invisible. All software, including computer worms and viruses, is just code and code is just data and data doesn't change how we perceive the computer it resides in unless the software on the computer intends for us to perceive the change; which carefully written malware thwarts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think of Teslas as cars just like we think of an iPhone as a phone, but a more accurate account of reality is that they're both just computers. One drives you around, but that's basically the sum of the difference. No matter how strange it may sound to a layperson, to a software developer it's so obvious that it isn't worth discussing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall that the third thing to understand about cyber security was that some classes of cyber attack compromise all instances of a device. WannaCry is just as possible for Teslas as it is for hospitals in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autonomous vehicles have a second problem: They can be used as powerful, directed bombs. A fully charged Telsa traveling over 200 kilometers (125 miles) per hour that crashes into a chemical plant, electrical subsystem, oil line, or gas station will have an impact worse than bombs that terrorists set off in the middle east.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now combine those two thoughts together. What are hundreds of thousands or millions of cars capable of taking out every gas station or power grid in the developed world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weapons of Mass Destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, I know how it sounds, but please hear me out. I'm deeply concerned about the future and I see no other way to secure it other than to characterize it this way and to bring my research and suggestions forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima killed eighty thousand people. Today the death of that number of people is possible by compromising only one type of Tesla and killing the driver alone. These things aren't in league with modern day nuclear weapons, but they are weapons of mass destruction just the same. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard&quot;&gt;hazard&lt;/a&gt; from autonomous devices is growing every day as we put increasing numbers of them on the road and in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attacks of this nature are not mere perturbations of general purpose computing systems or traditional tools of espionage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also contend that they aren't even the first class of cyber WMDs. Our formerly vulnerable industrial facilities and power plants probably fell in the same category, but it was prior to Stuxnet and most could be both physically isolated and disconnected from the internet, unlike self-driving cars. It is also harder to hack multitudes of them because they run software customized to their needs and it takes work to understand how to use compromised industrial equipment for evil. Lower hazard; easier risk mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True, the problem isn't solved, but it's being carefully watched and addressed by countries in the West. Autonomous devices are a much harder problem to tackle because there are going to be billions of them with the same set of technologies and we can't stop attackers from physically inspecting them. I'm convinced it is why some voices in the United States talk of &lt;a href=&quot;http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/cyberwar-the-nuclear-option-8638&quot;&gt;nuclear deterrence to cyber attack&lt;/a&gt;. They know the damage these weapons can cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the problems I've had over the past year and a half is how to communicate this idea without:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sounding like a crank.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giving ideas to terrorists or hostile foreign governments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this first occurred to me a year and a half ago I reported it to Public Safety Canada and a year later I met with my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Dzerowicz&quot;&gt;Member of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; to try to communicate my concerns and to get answers about what efforts we were putting forward to mitigate this threat. What I learned was that there were not only &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/autonomous-vehicles-self-driving-cars-uber-google-general-motors-1.4287591&quot;&gt;no regulations&lt;/a&gt; there were no plans for them either. While I think my MP took my concerns seriously and did what she could, I came to understand that political will lags public outcry and that the best way of protecting the public from this threat is to make this concern public so we can change the way we think and talk about cyber security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've contacted most major autonomous car companies, including Tesla, BMW, GM, Toyota, Waymo, and others. With the exception of GM, my technical questions about the nature of their cyber security practices were completely ignored. The person I emailed at GM answered what she could, but there's a limit to what a corporation can share because obscurity is a valid defensive measure. It's how passwords and authorization tokens work. But if decision makers in large automotive companies had a magic solution that startup software developers somehow missed it should be front page news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also used this time to quietly talk with researchers from military think tanks, autonomous vehicle committees, university professors, cyber security experts, respected personal contacts, and members of the intelligence community. I've even talked to a member of the cyber warfare division of a major military. It was hard to convince some of them to accept my characterization of this threat as cyber WMDs, but only two of them disagreed with me overall. They rebutted that individual cars are much easier to hack and after they are first used in a terror attack we will get the political will to fix the problem. One security expert countered that unethical cyber experts lack incentive; but when I brought up cyber warfare arms sales and far out &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Put_option&quot;&gt;put options&lt;/a&gt; he reversed his position completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I do not agree with these counterarguments, I include them to present as full a picture as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our automotive corporations know they need autonomous driving technology to compete and they also know they're exposed. Their primary defense is the obscurity of their platform. That it is unnecessary for individual automotives to service arbitrary, inbound internet traffic also helps. Most software developers haven't thought of self driving cars, cyber security, and national security at the same time, nor do they know the interfaces that the communication systems on automotives expose. When I bring up the nature of this threat to strangers with data science stickers on their laptops while pretending to be a layperson, they assure me that things are fine because there &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be regulation. Even smart people, used to thinking via &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/first-principles&quot;&gt;first principles&lt;/a&gt;, have trouble thinking critically about new ideas from people they don't know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people at the NSA, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cse-cst.gc.ca/&quot;&gt;CSE&lt;/a&gt;, and others are working very hard to do what they can to protect us, but neither they, nor the automotive companies have anything special secretly rolled up their sleeve that they've managed to hide from the millions of people involved in automotive manufacture. If it were easy for countries to coordinate with industry, then our phones would imperceptibly communicate GPS location data in high pitched sound during calls to emergency services (911 in North America) to communicate location. Instead, we have hundreds of thousands of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-XlyB_QQYs&quot;&gt;preventable deaths&lt;/a&gt; around the world each year. Rather than save lives, this simple technological method is instead used to track television ad viewership through hacked phones or otherwise monitored audio devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyber attack of this type is difficult, but it isn't impossible. What this means is that we have time. These exploits are possible for the NSA, but they aren't something that ISIL or the DPRK is currently capable of pulling off. We're exposed, yes, but the sky isn't falling. We have time to create the right regulations and international agreements if we can foster the political will and if we act with haste. However, if a cyber attack of this nature does happen before we fix things please do not take my words as proof that the event is a conspiracy by the US government. Liberal democracies don't purposely kill their own civilians. Belief to the contrary is rooted in deranged ideology and black propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a number of ideas on how to approach a solution to this problem, but the most important one is this: Engineers and software professionals need to recognize that our politicians aren't able to intelligently regulate autonomous devices and our corporations lack the incentives to completely protect us. A well-funded, open source effort with clear recommendations will be the most effective way to securing the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software professionals need to encourage electrical and mechanical engineers to submit open source proposals that will help autonomous vehicle companies and governments protect the public. The OSINT and Arms Control community need to help with drafts of international agreements to make cyber targeting of civilian systems resulting in mass casualty during wartime illegal under international law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legal minds and translators, especially those with STEM backgrounds, can help craft sample regulations that less technical countries can use as a baseline. Even if you lack these skills, you can make a difference just by writing a pen and paper letter to your governmental representative or writing an article for your local newspaper about how important it is to work together to solve this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our trade agreements need to reflect the changing nature of our interdependence. China recently announced that foreign self-driving automotive companies like Google's Waymo cannot photo every square inch of their roads due to concerns over national security. But autonomous vehicles require both cameras and an internet connection to operate. What difference does it make? If followed to its logical conclusion the regulation will have the effect of keeping foreign-made autonomous vehicles off of Chinese roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese either understand the threat that autonomous devices hold and want to limit the potential damage that foreign autonomous devices present or they are attempting to use national security as a fig leaf to mask their larger ambitions: Supremacy in the next automotive revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China's population is 40% greater than Nato's; they're modernizing and we won't have digital supremacy over them forever. Liberalized trade is great, but national security takes precedent. International cooperation on autonomous device regulation and symmetric trade agreements with harsh violation provisions are required. Otherwise, we cannot allow non-friendly states access to our autonomous device markets. Nor can we allow components from these countries in our autonomous devices. Today, China is both an opportunity and a geopolitical threat. Continued economic integration is important because friendship, peace, and, ultimately, alliance between China and the West is possible; but we need to do so carefully. Without a cooperative China this challenge becomes an order of magnitude harder to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though my primary recommendation is a well organized open source initiative, I have my own specific suggestions after thinking about this over the past year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First allow me to address what I think won't work:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reliance on off-the-shelf antivirus software.&lt;/strong&gt; Antivirus software is the perfect platform for foreign intelligence services because it requires heavy disk scans with decryption. It should be used only where absolutely required, and entrusted only if it is from a highly vetted corporation from an allied nation. Antivirus software compromises one thing for another, and should be treated only as a very last resort. In a perfect world we wouldn't use or need 3rd party antivirus, but in the short to medium term it may be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trying to air gap autonomous devices.&lt;/strong&gt; Between aerial Bluetooth worms traveling across smart light bulbs, debugging devices at your local automotive repair shop, or just plain old mistakes like vulnerable software defined radios; air gaps can't be ensured. It never stopped the CIA so we shouldn't count on it stopping the DPRK, either. It was my first instinct a year and a half ago, and it took me a long time to lose, but even though it works for power plants it won't work for cars. It will just slow things down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code review by governmental agencies.&lt;/strong&gt; The British may review the code of Chinese network gear in Banbury, Oxfordshire, but even they admit that if it ever came to total war with the Chinese they would likely have to replace it all with American or EU stuff. The chief deterrent the UK uses to discourage the widespread intentional abuse of Chinese networking gear is loss of trade and reputation. The British haven't convinced themselves that Huawei switches or antennas are completely safe because they've inspected every byte of the source. Code is as slippery as an eel. What you analyze today is irrelevant tomorrow. Code is just data and data changes. Plus, there are plenty of Huawei pieces that got through code review only to have critical breaches in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trusting automotive companies to self-regulate.&lt;/strong&gt; Equifax and Ashley Madison were secure until they weren't. National security with WMDs isn't something to entrust to corporations, and certainly not corporations from countries with a poor history on cyber security. Capitalism rewards invention and risk, not long tail risk mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certifying individual components or vehicles.&lt;/strong&gt; Detailed, prescriptive regulation and individual certification is too slow to keep pace with the fast changing nature of modern software development. Our most secure software companies update their code multiple times per day. This isn't just a correlative artifact of well run tech companies—it's causal. The first actor to find a vulnerability is often the organization responsible for the service or device and getting the fix out as fast as possible is important. The only counter example I can think of is Nasa, but their interfaces and latency issues are out of this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, regulations should be functional. Introduce maxims such as &lt;em&gt;Data should never be readable by an intermediary network device&lt;/em&gt;, and, &lt;em&gt;no action taken by the media computer should change state in the control computer&lt;/em&gt;. This way fines and security bounties aren't arbitrary, but still allow automotive corporations to compete on the speed of their technology advancement while addressing concern over gambling on security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurance market should not be responsible for pricing widescale cyber attack. They have neither the balance sheet, nor the expertise to effectively estimate the risk. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution&quot;&gt;Poisson Distribution&lt;/a&gt; is wonderful but it can't be used to price or predict mass cyber attacks. It requires statistical independence, something vulnerabilities of this nature do not have. It is impossible to get precise measures of the probability or scale of black swan cyber events. Civil engineers design for one in hundred year storms. What is a one in hundred year cyber attack?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though blockchains could be useful to ensure code is consistent across a myriad of devices, they also delay safety critical updates. Also, some security techniques are harder to employ if code must be consistent across devices, so I lean against recommending them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waiting for autonomous vehicles to be used in small scale attacks before crafting legislation. Though it is easier to hack a single computer in person, the resulting regulations will not be geared towards widespread attack. The concern should first be focussed on our national security. Securing soft targets should be a distant secondary priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If terrorists can hack one car in person why wouldn't they hack more before initiating an attack?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only the wasteful would because a pre-step of hacking many or all devices of the same type is hacking a single one locally to make sure that that the approach works. A great insight I would have missed were it not for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattlovesmath&quot;&gt;@mattlovesmath&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With what won't work out of the way, allow me to share what I think might help:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any multi-use, non-military device that can fly, drive, walk, rocket, or swim autonomously must allow for a standardized set of components designed for different contexts (underwater, high heat, etc.) that can be collectively reasoned about as a singular concept I term &lt;em&gt;the safety module&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power or fuel of the propulsion mechanism, and the computers and sensors that command the autonomous device must both connect through the safety module. If this is not possible due to the nature of the propulsion system (e.g., devices with solid fuel chemical rockets), then an emergency disabling or guidance system should be present instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device must not be powerable or operable if the safety module is not present and the device should not be able to alter or remove the safety module of any device, including its own. Though military devices shouldn't be subject to these regulations, they should follow as many of them as possible, and when not possible, strive to follow their intent in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyber-secure drones and killbots, ironically, are something that our militaries have a vested interest in acquiring, so they're presently less of a concern. Plus, they can be safely turned off when they aren't needed so fewer of them threaten us during peacetime. If they do employ safety modules they should employ layers of them so our defenses cannot be brought offline by breaching a single safety broadcasting system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UN should take steps to protect the right for every country to specify what safety modules are acceptable within their domain and it should be against international law to allow the manufacture or sale of civilian autonomous devices that do not meet these standards. It should also be illegal to create products that only accept safety modules from a predefined set of nations. States will probably contribute to open source initiates to establish a common working platform, but will also probably employ final tweaks based on their own understanding of the threats they face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Close allies, like the United States and Canada, will either trust each others modules or work together to develop a jointly managed strategy. Every type of standardized safety module should have a preset expiry date and the bays that the module is designed to fit within should be designed with this in mind so that upgrading the design of the safety module isn't costly. After months of warning, safety modules reaching their expiry date should safely shutdown the device they enable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manufacture or provision of counterfeit safety modules by states should be considered an Act of War and be illegal under international law. Individuals knowingly involved should be treated as felons and arrested. By Interpol if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Devices could be designed to accept multiple modules&lt;/strong&gt; any of which can initiate safety procedures. That way autonomous movement does not need to cease when changing jurisdictions; though care would need to be taken to ensure that the devices were truly independent. Any one safety module should be able to shutdown or disconnect their host, even if other modules have been designed to act maliciously. This isn't just for hard nosed realism, safety module redundancy is helpful since villains should never be able to negate protective measures through a safety module. Security here should be additive or, at worst, redundant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The safety module must be able to &lt;strong&gt;communicate through multiple channels&lt;/strong&gt;; including satellite, radio, and LTE. Pulsating light should act as a backup if the radio spectrum is jammed or unavailable, and the submerged should pre-planned communication with civilian &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.darpa.mil/program/distributed-agile-submarine-hunting&quot;&gt;subullites&lt;/a&gt;. By utilizing cryptographic keys and certificates, states can order autonomous devices through the safety module to head emergency commands like &lt;em&gt;shutdown in 5 seconds&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;cease software updates until further instruction&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;revert to fallback computer and safely cease operation&lt;/em&gt; and the safety module should parrot these commands through a secure one way channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be assumed that the module may be relaying commands to a compromised control computer, so the module itself must be able to disengage both the power and the controlling computer during an emergency. The automotive navigation system should routinely communicate intention to national bodies to establish a geofence that, if breached, would initiate automated emergency procedures. Countries should also analyse the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_planning_and_scheduling&quot;&gt;automated plans&lt;/a&gt; for statistical anomalies, like number of devices simultaneously proximate to soft targets, to detect when an adversary may be subtly organizing the position of autonomous devices to reduce attack detection response time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cryptographic tricks could be used to try to handle some of the negative implications to our privacy. But the reality is that regardless of the measures taken, autonomous devices are going to be easy for most states to track. Just as modern phones are. The tool to fight abuse of the safety module by illiberal states should be economic sanctions and armed conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most straightforward way of securing the safety module would be to employ both a secured computer within the safety module and a fallback to an unchangeable &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit&quot;&gt;ASIC&lt;/a&gt;, each with their own set of cryptographic keys. Either should be able to power down the device in the event that the other is compromised. The secured computer of the safety module should communicate with the main computer over shielded, private, encrypted, one-way (i.e., connectionless) bus and electrical diodes should enforce this directive. Though I'm not fully certain here; radio broadcast seems jammable and forgeable (sans frequency hopping), but a bus connected to the control computer seems potentially dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any computer must communicate to the safety module this should be accomplished by having the message relayed to the manufacturer through the internet or with a predetermined physical state change to the safety module, like the flip of a physical switch. For example, if the media computer detects that the control computer has been compromised while the automobile is in an area lacking an internet connection, it should physically flip an emergency shutdown switch to safely cease vehicle operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safety modules should have no ports and no network connection&lt;/strong&gt; to debugging devices or upgrade servers. The code that commands them should not be alterable at the hardware layer. Their job is simple: Relay commands and initiate emergency shutdowns. They should be designed to be regularly recyclable, and should be physically replaced in secure, government run facilities when requiring an upgrade or when necessary at boarder crossings. Exceptions can be made in extreme situations, like remote communities or, temporarily, during natural disasters. Very large bounties and ceremonial honors should be awarded to security researchers that bring forward critical vulnerabilities for safety modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standardized, redundant systems&lt;/strong&gt; are another safeguard. If power is removed from the primary computer of an autonomous device then the vehicle should still be able to surface, land, or park safely. Hard shutdowns should always be available to stop weaponization, but it shouldn't be the first resort during a cyberwar. For planes my instincts say that we should either plan to keep pilots around or have flight attendants trained as backup pilots, but this may limit options for smaller autonomous aircraft. Perhaps they should have redundant fallback computers that do nothing but glide?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for a device to go faster than a preset limit it should request permission to do so via the internet and it should be enabled by the module for a predefined period. If the device is traveling to an area without an internet connection, it should request this capability beforehand. That way our autonomous devices can get to the hospital quickly during an emergencies, but governments can limit how many simultaneous high speed vehicles are allowed. A car moving half the speed has one quarter of the kinetic energy and is less likely to have a battery explosion on contact. GPS signal is jammable and forgeable, so use multiple methods to determine location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isolating the control computer&lt;/strong&gt; of our autonomous devices is also important. For example, the automotive media computer should not be connected to the control computer. Today, many automotives communicate through a Controller Area Network Bus, or CAN bus. It is an unauthenticated, unencrypted multi-master bus. Around the world software developers reading the previous sentence just spat out their coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not allow control computers to read data directly from the CAN bus. If we must get state from the CAN bus then it should be through an intermediary component that converts signals to one of a finite series of states, enums, or bounded analog voltages. Create an international agreement to sunset the CAN bus and replace it with something more secure. The replacement components and On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) systems should be viewed as methods for the patient to quietly gain control of thousands of vehicles and should be rethought, replaced, or removed completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these proposals, like the previous one, will make repairs by small shops hard or impossible, but the unfortunate reality is that it makes no difference decades from now because vehicle maintenance is also going to be automated and automated vehicle navigation mean automotive collisions will be far less likely. It's the primary reason automating vehicles is a good thing. Electric vehicles also inherently require less routine maintenance because they have less dramatic engines and drivetrains. We're lucky in one sense: This transition is happening at the same time as the transition to fully electric vehicles. Let's approach it as an opportunity to wind down small shops where we can instead of getting them to retool just before going bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should &lt;strong&gt;solve social problems from automation&lt;/strong&gt; with paid training programs for new jobs and we should institute a basic income to make sure nobody gets completely left behind. We have tools to finance this, like temporarily higher income taxes after paid training programs and targeted taxes on corporate income from patents on AI and robotics. Corporations around the world benefit from our collective investments in universities and infrastructure, and everyone should benefit from automation. International treaties should set minimum effective tax rates for corporations and high net worth individuals. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/8836f284-592a-11e0-b9f6-00144feab49a&quot;&gt;This 2011 piece&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs&quot;&gt;Jeffrey Sachs&lt;/a&gt; summarizes my views near perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our designs should &lt;strong&gt;take a note from Apple's Secure Enclave&lt;/strong&gt; and mandate that critical tasks, like updating the control computer's software, be accomplished in a similar way. The security enclave should also have fallback communication methods to safely disable the car during a critical cyber vulnerability. Ideally, the enclave should be designed with multiple sets of chips from different manufacturers to mitigate damage from espionage or hardware vulnerability, like Intel's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability)&quot;&gt;Meltdown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The network shouldn't be trusted&lt;/strong&gt; and DNS and certificate chains shouldn't either. Employ IP pinning and certificate pinning with fallback strategies. It shouldn't be possible to send or receive UDP packets over IP through any networked device. UDP over untrusted gear isn't secure and we should stop pretending that it is. Support &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; IPv4 and IPv6 for update servers so if a vulnerability is discovered in either the safety module or enclave can instruct the update process to utilize one over the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the media computer supports Bluetooth connections or connections to untrusted devices like phones, then the media computer and its components should be completely isolated from any components involved in navigation or control. Create a separate navigation computer with its own user interface so attacks cannot be pre-staged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedicated_short-range_communications&quot;&gt;DSRC&lt;/a&gt; should be &lt;a href=&quot;http://glenechogroup.isebox.net/securesetaccelerator/dedicated-short-range-communications-dsrc-expose-critical-gaps-in-security-and-privacy&quot;&gt;similarly redesigned&lt;/a&gt; and isolated. I haven't researched this one in great detail, but with that proviso: From the surface it looks difficult because the control computer needs to assume the component responsible for it has been compromised, but the component needs to communicate with the control computer, so it's an ideal surface for attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A partial mitigation I can think of is to split its function across two components. The first connects to the control computer and communicates a finite series of states related to multi-vehicle cruise control and collision avoidance, and another that connects to the media computer for things like automated electronic tolls. Compromise of this component should come with a large bounty to encourage less hackable solutions, like stateless ASICs. Even so, research and ideas are needed here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use HTTPS/2 with TLS 1.2 or greater and ensure ciphers and configurations employ forward secrecy. Nginx and other web servers get the default wrong here, so employ care and regularly scan endpoints. Do not solely rely on HTTPS no matter how seemingly secure your setup seems. Ciphers aren't perfect and misconfigurations, evil certificates, and protocol downgrade attacks are too easy. &lt;strong&gt;Use client side encryption in addition to HTTPS&lt;/strong&gt; and use really big keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ship every car with its own, massive One Time Pad (OTP). Create the OTP with multiple secure random sources on computers never connected to the internet in the secure, guarded facility used for code signing. It should not be physically possible to read the same bit twice from the OTP. The Snowden leaks taught us that layered encryption is what the CIA does to communicate, so do the same. Final code review should be on very simple, secure computers that have never been connected to the internet and are as stateless as possible. These computers should also scan codebases for irregular characters and should communicate through a permanent, physical, auditable channel; like write only disks or giant printed QR codes. Otherwise it's just another easy hop for the talented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This layered approach will ensure that compromise of one layer does not enable &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack&quot;&gt;MITM attacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never SSH&lt;/strong&gt; or otherwise allow access via programmer terminal to any autonomous vehicle carrying passengers or those outside of secure testing facilities. This includes cars under development. Since working on this article I've heard a couple very reckless stories, but unfortunately nobody is willing to publicly or anonymously breach their non-disclosure agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to come forward, leave your electronics on their chargers at home and hand me a hand written note. I'll vet you, then connect you to an attorney that takes cyber security seriously. There are bad managers everywhere so don't just irresponsibly Snowden your employer. Whistleblowing should be safe, measured, ethical, and, if at all possible, legal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employ cryptographic signing and encryption&lt;/strong&gt; on everything that is possible, given performance and safety considerations. This should include both code and data in volatile memory. All updates to the control computer should be encrypted, signed, and double checksummed. The checksum should be shared with governments and broadcast to the safety module. If the control computer cannot verify the software update signature or checksums with the safety module the control computer should shutdown the vehicle safely. The safety module should disconnect the power from the computer if it does not do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All code on any device connected to the control or navigation computer should have a high degree of test coverage, and these tests and other techniques, like fuzzing, should be run before any software update to any component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bug bounties, like those employed by GM, Tesla, and others are a good start, but they do not pay well enough to fund non-casual security research. Government mandated and &lt;strong&gt;internationally agreed upon rewards&lt;/strong&gt; should be set and payments should scale with the number of autonomous devices in operation. Network attacks and social engineering should be allowed so our national security isn't compromised because IT trusts compromised laptops that look like they're from Dell. Other corporate espionage techniques, like moles, should remain illegal and outside the scope of the bounty. Bounties for real remote control should range between $100 to $10k USD per device, depending on factors like max speed attainable and geofence breachability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harshly fine and imprison those that manufacture, sell, or provision counterfeit automotive electronics. Extend import and manufacture regulatory bodies to routinely inspect automotives and components. Use international treaties to regulate ocean bound autonomous devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a note from what the USA did during the past twenty years and &lt;strong&gt;dramatically increase funding for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_security&quot;&gt;COMSEC&lt;/a&gt; and cyber operations&lt;/strong&gt;. Expand or create cyber reserve programs to cross pollinate skills between armed forces and the private sector. Try to find a way to engage cannabis using cyber experts through organized challenges or well funded think tanks, even if it isn't possible politically to have them join the intelligence services or armed forces. Update Nato military spending guidelines and other alliances to include a minimum on cyber operations because defense is a collective benefit. Stop stigmatizing addiction. Create targeted programs to help drug users transition to sobriety if they want to help but need to quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fund research into chips that are specialized for security&lt;/strong&gt; so vulnerabilities like Meltdown and Spectre are less likely. Create regulations that encourage safer programming languages, like Haskell and Rust, over those that have unsafe or undefined behaviour. Sunset unsafe languages, like C and C++, for security critical devices via regulation over the next decade. In the interim, devices should come with a cyber safety score similar to metrics for other devices like miles per gallon or kilowatt hours per year. Trust non-profits, like Mozilla, and open source initiatives over proposals from automotive corporations to help craft these. Include detection of violation of these in bounties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build systems to detect reverse engineering of security critical code&lt;/strong&gt; and collaborate with intelligence agencies to filter friendly security researchers from potential hostiles or cyberarms manufacturers. Investigate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mulliner.org/blog/blosxom.cgi/security/re_canary.html&quot;&gt;canaries&lt;/a&gt; for this, a suggestion by security researcher &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/collinrm&quot;&gt;@collinrm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a silver lining to all the work we have to do: The nature of this threat may finally bring about the political will, economic incentives, and ideas we need to finally secure our computer systems. We may wake up decades from now and talk with amazement about cyber events of the early 2000s like we do of the chemical fires on the rivers of the mid 1900s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epilogue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I accidentally stumbled into this and it has taken a lot out of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the piece is dedicated to my parents I kept them and most others in the dark until very recently. The two people I want to thank most are Julia Starostenko and Paddy Kerley. Julia saw the burdened, worried side of me that few others have and did her best to help me direct my energy towards solutions. Thank you Julia. Patman thank you for being a frequent sounding board for some of my ideas and for contributing many of your own as well. I'm sure you'll both measurably change the world for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aidan Campbell, Jaco Joubert, and Mina Riad; thank you all for hearing me out and for guidance. Mina, thank you for convincing me I wasn't crazy and that the steps I had taken while trying to disprove this theory were well beyond what should have been necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Scott LaFoy, Jeffrey Lewis, and everyone else behind the Arms Control Wonk Podcast, Slack, and blog. I've learned so much from all of you. Thanks also to everyone involved in OSINT and Arms Control community everywhere. If we're going to beat the odds that the Fermi Paradox seems to imply it will be because of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Max Veytsman for many insights that have made me a better hacker and for reviewing an early draft. Thanks to Phillip Mendonça-Vieira, David Wolever, and Andrew Louis for challenging my characterization before it was fully developed. It pushed me to read thousands of pages of technical documents and books on spycraft. My understanding would not have been as complete without it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Razvan Draghici, Ash Furrow, and David Wright, thank you all for understanding this idea so quickly and completely. It made it feel more real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Matt McInnis for hearing me out and for that perfect insight. Thanks to an anonymous Waymo employee who entertained my ideas without breaking his NDA. Thanks the anonymous employee from an unnamed automotive company for the off the record stories of negligence. Thanks to Rebecca A White from GM for answers to many of my questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the people at the RAND Corporation who treated my ideas with interest, respect, and helpful resources; finally giving me the resolve to take this on myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're far from perfect, but I'd also like to thank the American intelligence community for protecting us from cyber attacks all these years. I would like to conclude this essay with a transcript I put together from the CIA's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/podcasts/intelligence-matters&quot;&gt;Intelligence Matters&lt;/a&gt; podcast that I think is especially insightful. It is between Sue Gordon, Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence, and Michael Morell, twice former Acting Director of the CIA. Apologies in advance for transcription errors, it's late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morell:&lt;/strong&gt; So some specific issues, the first is cyber. So when you were at CIA the then CIA director John Brennan asked you to take a look at that issue. And to think about how does this affect, both from a defensive perspective, and an offensive perspective, and a perspective of how we do our job every day. How does this affect us, this thing called cyber. And I heard rumours that your answer was: &quot;It affects everything! And we need to embed it both defensively and offensively in how we do our job into everything we do.&quot; Do I have that right? Does that make sense? How do you think about that from a community perspective?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gordon:&lt;/strong&gt; Great question, and I think the moment and the answer were relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gordon:&lt;/strong&gt; He said, &quot;So I'd like you to fix cyber for the agency.&quot; I asked, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; He said, &quot;I don't know.&quot; And then we went off to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gordon:&lt;/strong&gt; Where we ultimately settled is: How do you affect our mission in a digital environment? That allows you to think about how do you protect our information in a world where we are not without adversaries with capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gordon:&lt;/strong&gt; How do you affect your offensive mission through the digital domain to have the reach you need? How do you assess what the world is doing when no longer are nations concern's (the land around them) that anyone has the ability to affect reach? How do we train our people? How do we do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gordon:&lt;/strong&gt; So the way I think about cyber, and it is a good one for the nation to address, is: Every aspect of national interests will ultimately be effected through the digital environment. So there are specific disciplines—cyber defense, cyber protection, cryptocurrency—I mean there are just a number of things; but ultimately if you just think about them technically we're gunna miss the fact that it is national interests being effected throughout that space. So while it has a technical component the way to think about its intent and to imagine your response is in not the technology but rather in whats being effected. And if you get there you are going to know that we've always known how to deal with adversaries who would do harm to us economically or adversaries who would effect military superiority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gordon:&lt;/strong&gt; They're just now doing it through various domains. What is difficult about cyber—just as it was in thinking about the agency—it is not as a whole of country, not a whole of government problem, because it does bring in very stark relief that our industries our infrastructure are actually part of national security; and in this domain 90 percent of our action and exposure is not controlled by the government so it will test us to find new ways to partner in order to effect national security in a modern way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morell:&lt;/strong&gt; So a cyber expert, and maybe you saw this recently, he wrote what I thought was a fascinating piece, in the cyber brief; where he posed two questions: One was, despite our concern we haven't seen a 9/11, Pearl Harbor style attack on our critical infrastructure, right, we were always worried about that. It hasn't happened. And his question was: &quot;Why hasn't that happened?&quot; right. And the other question he posed was: &quot;Given everything you just said, and a lot of people think that way why aren't we further along in this journey of dealing and adapting to and taking care of this cyber issue? You know, why are we seeming to be moving more slowly that we should be here. How do you think about those two questions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gordon:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah so first things first. I think the expansion in cyber capabilities by our adversaries; the rate of progress they're making in terms what they can do is really shocking. And their awareness of how they can effect their interest and their reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gordon:&lt;/strong&gt; So to be too comfy on what has happened in the past as prelude to the future is as much of a folly as it has always been. Why haven't we seen seen some massive strategic devastating physical attack? One these are pretty hard to pull off, straight technically. I also think we're thinking too narrowly about what a cyber attack is, back to my previous question is we're thinking about 9/11 taking out the eastern seaboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gordon:&lt;/strong&gt; What's the real way to do strategic effect on the United States? Make us lose confidence on ourselves. So when you think about what a cyber 9/11 might look like maybe its not just technical. And why haven't we had it? And we are doing a really good job about getting the word our about cyber hygiene. And again a paid public announcement: Patch. Know who you are accepting emails from, and all this; but I would opine that I think we need to think more broadly about what a 9/11 looks like and it might not be a technical attack. The second part of your question was?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morell:&lt;/strong&gt; Why aren't we further along as a nation in dealing with this when we all seem to understand some the threats, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gordon:&lt;/strong&gt; So I think that we have a moment where we might get there. I actually really admire the work that both the intelligence community and the administration are doing about being more public about what's happening and the companies as well, so that now we're seeing what's happening to us and you know we're great in a crisis and we're seeing the crisis more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gordon:&lt;/strong&gt; Before it was a company concealing the fact of a cyber attack because they have a fiduciary responsibility. And now we're all seeing that we're connected, so I think there is a moment that we can. I think that we'll be successful if we start with the response we'd liked to have, and then think about how we can use all the skills to be able to get there. I think we're still leading a little bit with each of our domains, and saying &quot;here is what I can do, here is what I can do&quot; in the intelligence community it's called leading with our authorities, rather than leading with the question, and I think we're still doing that a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gordon:&lt;/strong&gt; The private sector certain has things they need to protect, the government certainly has things they need to protect, and so we're leading with what we're able to do rather than coming together and saying &quot;how do we solve this problem?&quot; I think this is something that everyone recognizes we need to do and so the optimist in me says: &quot;This will be an era where we see us knock that one off.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Practical Deep Learning for Coders 2018</title>
<link>http://www.fast.ai/2018/01/26/v2-launch/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.fast.ai/2018/01/26/v2-launch/</guid>
<description>&lt;span class=&quot;post-date&quot;&gt;26 Jan 2018 &lt;em&gt;Jeremy Howard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;[ &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fast.ai/tag/courses&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highligher-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;nobr&gt;courses&lt;/nobr&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fast.ai/2017/09/08/introducing-pytorch-for-fastai/&quot;&gt;we announced&lt;/a&gt; that we were developing a new deep learning course based on Pytorch (and a new library we have built, called fastai), with the goal of allowing more students to be able to achieve world-class results with deep learning. Today, we are making this course, &lt;a href=&quot;http://course.fast.ai&quot;&gt;Practical Deep Learning for Coders 2018&lt;/a&gt;, generally available for the first time, following the completion of a preview version of the course by 600 students through our diversity fellowship, international fellowship, and Data Institute in-person programs. The only prerequisites are a year of coding experience, and high school math (math required for understanding the material is introduced as required during the course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course includes around 15 hours of lessons and a number of interactive notebooks, and is now available for free (with no ads) at &lt;a href=&quot;http://course.fast.ai/&quot;&gt;course.fast.ai&lt;/a&gt;. About 80% of the material is new this year, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;All models train much faster than last year’s equivalents, are much more accurate, and require fewer lines of code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greatly simplified access to cloud-based GPU servers, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crestle.com&quot;&gt;Crestle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paperspace.com&quot;&gt;Paperspace&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shows how to surpass all previous academic benchmarks in text classification, and how to match the state of the art in collaborative filtering, and time series and structured data analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverages the dynamic compilation features of &lt;a href=&quot;http://pytorch.org/&quot;&gt;Pytorch&lt;/a&gt; to provide deeper understanding of the internals of designing and training models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Covers recent network architectures such as Resnet and ResNeXt, including building a Resnet with batch normalization from scratch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;combining-research-and-education&quot;&gt;Combining research and education&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fast.ai&quot;&gt;fast.ai&lt;/a&gt; is first and foremost a research lab. Our research focuses on how to make practically useful deep learning more widely accessible. Often we’ve found that the current state of the art (SoTA) approaches aren’t good enough to be used in practice, so we have to figure out how to improve them. This means that our course is unusual in that although it’s designed to be accessible with minimal prerequisites (just high school math and a year of coding experience) we show how to match or better SoTA approaches in computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), time series and structured data analysis, and collaborative filtering. Therefore, we find our students have wildly varying backgrounds, including 14 year old high school students and tenured professors of statistics and successful Silicon Valley startup CEOs (and dairy farmers, accountants, buddhist monks, and product managers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want our students to be able to solve their most challenging and important problems, to transform their industries and organizations, which we believe is the potential of deep learning. We are not just trying to teach people how to get existing jobs in the field — but to go far beyond that. Therefore, since we first ran our deep learning course, we have been constantly curating best practices, and benchmarking and developing many techniques, trialing them against Kaggle leaderboards and academic state-of-the-art results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2018 course shows how to (all with no more than a single GPU and a few seconds to a few hours of computation):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build world-class image classifiers with as little as 3 lines of code (in a Kaggle competition running during the preview class, 17 of the top 20 ranked competitors were fast.ai students!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greatly surpass the academic SoTA in NLP sentiment analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a movie recommendation system that is competitive with the best highly specialized models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replicate top Kaggle solutions in structured data analysis problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build the 2015 imagenet winning resnet architecture and batch normalization layer from scratch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-unique-approach&quot;&gt;A unique approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our earlier 2017 course was very successful, with many students developing deep learning skills that let them do things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sara Hooker, who only started coding 2 years ago, and is now part of the elite &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.googleblog.com/2017/07/the-google-brain-residency-program-one.html&quot;&gt;Google Brain Residency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tim Anglade, who used Tensorflow to create the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/15/not-hotdog-app-hbo-silicon-valley/&quot;&gt;Not Hot Dog&lt;/a&gt; app for HBO’s Silicon Valley, leading Google’s CEO to tweet “&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/864582393985880064&quot;&gt;our work here is done&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gleb Esman, who created a new fraud product for Splunk using the tools he learned in the course, and was featured on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.splunk.com/blog/2017/04/18/deep-learning-with-splunk-and-tensorflow-for-security-catching-the-fraudster-in-neural-networks-with-behavioral-biometrics.html&quot;&gt;Splunk’s blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jacques Mattheij, who built a robotic system to &lt;a href=&quot;http://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/hands-on/how-i-built-an-ai-to-sort-2-tons-of-lego-pieces&quot;&gt;sort two tons of lego&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Karthik Kannan, founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.letsenvision.com&quot;&gt;letsenvision.com&lt;/a&gt;, who told us “Today I’ve picked up steam enough to confidently work on my own CV startup and the seed for it was sowed by fast.ai with Pt.1 and Pt.2”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matthew Kleinsmith and Brendon Fortuner, who in 24 hours built a system to add filters to the background and foreground of videos, giving them victory in the &lt;em&gt;2017 Deep Learning Hackathon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new course is 80% new material, reflecting the major developments that have occurred in the last 12 months in the field. However, the key educational approach is unchanged: a top-down, code-first approach to teaching deep learning that is unique. We teach &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Making-Learning-Whole-Principles-Transform/dp/0470633719/&quot;&gt;“the whole game”&lt;/a&gt;–starting off by showing how to use a complete, working, very usable, state of the art deep learning network to solve real world problems, by using simple, expressive tools. And then gradually digging deeper and deeper into understanding how those tools are made, and how the tools that make those tools are made, and so on… We always teach through examples: ensuring that there is a context and a purpose that you can understand intuitively, rather than starting with algebraic symbol manipulation. For more information, have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fast.ai/2016/10/08/teaching-philosophy/&quot;&gt;Providing a Good Education in Deep Learning&lt;/a&gt;, one of the first things we wrote after fast.ai was launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good example of this approach is shown in the article &lt;a href=&quot;https://towardsdatascience.com/fun-with-small-image-data-sets-8c83d95d0159&quot;&gt;Fun with small image data-sets&lt;/a&gt;, where a fast.ai student shows how to use the teachings from lesson 1 to build near perfect classifiers with &amp;lt;20 training images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most valuable resource of all are the &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.fast.ai/&quot;&gt;flourishing forums&lt;/a&gt; where thousands of students and alumni are discussing the lessons, their projects, the latest research papers, and more. This community has built many valuable resources, such as the helpful notes and guides provided by Reshama Shaikh, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some forum threads have become important sources of information, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.fast.ai/t/making-your-own-server/174&quot;&gt;Making your own server&lt;/a&gt; which now has over 500 posts full of valuable information, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.fast.ai/t/implementing-mask-r-cnn/2234&quot;&gt;Implementing Mask R-CNN&lt;/a&gt; which has been viewed by thousands of people that are interested in this cutting edge segmentation approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-new-deep-learning-library&quot;&gt;A new deep learning library&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new course is built on top of Pytorch, and uses a new library (called &lt;em&gt;fastai&lt;/em&gt;) that we developed to make Pytorch more powerful and easy to use. I won’t go into too much detail about this now, since we discussed the motivation in detail in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fast.ai/2017/09/08/introducing-pytorch-for-fastai/&quot;&gt;Introducing Pytorch for fast.ai&lt;/a&gt; and will be providing much more information about the implementation and API shortly. But to give a sense of what it means for students, here’s some examples of fastai in action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;fastai is the first library to implement the Learning Rate Finder (&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01186&quot;&gt;Smith 2015&lt;/a&gt;) which solves the challenging problem of selecting a good learning rate for your model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;http://www.fast.ai/images/lr_finder.png&quot; alt=&quot;Learning rate finder&quot;/&gt; Learning rate finder
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having found a good learning rate, you can train your model much faster and more reliably by utilizing Stochastic Gradient Descent with Restarts (SGDR) - again fastai is the first library to provide this feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;http://www.fast.ai/images/sgdr.png&quot; alt=&quot;Stochastic Gradient Descent with Restarts&quot;/&gt; Stochastic Gradient Descent with Restarts
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Once you’ve trained your model, you’ll want to view images that the model is getting wrong - fastai provides this feature in a single line of code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; src=&quot;http://www.fast.ai/images/bad_cats.png&quot; alt=&quot;Visualizing model errors&quot;/&gt; Visualizing model errors
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The same API can be used to train any kind of model with only minor changes - here are examples of training an image classifier, and a recommendation system:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; src=&quot;http://www.fast.ai/images/cats_fit.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fitting an image classifier&quot;/&gt; Fitting an image classifier &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; src=&quot;http://www.fast.ai/images/movielens_fit.png&quot; alt=&quot;Training a recommendation system&quot;/&gt; Training a recommendation system
&lt;p&gt;The course also shows how to use Keras with Tensorflow, although it takes a lot more code and compute time to get a much lower accuracy in this case. The basic steps are very similar however, so students can rapidly switch between libraries by using the conceptual understanding developed in the lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;taking-your-learning-further&quot;&gt;Taking your learning further&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 2 of the 2018 course will be run in San Francisco for 7 weeks from March 19. If you’re interested in attending, please see the details on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usfca.edu/data-institute/certificates/deep-learning-part-two&quot;&gt;in-person course web site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Microsoft disables Spectre mitigations as Intel’s patches cause instability</title>
<link>http://www.securityweek.com/microsoft-disables-spectre-mitigations-due-instability</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Out-of-band Windows updates released by Microsoft over the weekend disable mitigations for one of the Spectre attack variants as they can cause systems to become unstable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both microcode and software updates designed to address the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities have turned out to be buggy, often making systems unbootable or causing them to reboot more frequently. Intel has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.securityweek.com/intel-halts-spectre-meltdown-cpu-patches-over-unstable-code&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;suspended&lt;/a&gt; its patches until the issue is resolved and advised customers to stop deploying the updates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.securityweek.com/hp-dell-halt-bios-updates-over-buggy-cpu-patches&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;HP, Dell, Lenovo, VMware&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.securityweek.com/red-hat-pulls-spectre-patches-due-instability&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt; and others had paused the patches and now Microsoft has done the same.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The problem appears to be related to CVE-2017-5715, which has been described as a “branch target injection vulnerability.” This is one of the flaws that allows Spectre attacks, specifically Spectre Variant 2 attacks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Microsoft has confirmed that Intel’s patches cause system instability and can in some cases lead to data loss or corruption. Update KB4078130 released by the company over the weekend for Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 – for both clients and servers – disables the mitigation for CVE-2017-5715.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The company has also provided instructions for advanced users on how to manually enable and disable Spectre Variant 2 mitigations through registry settings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“As of January 25, there are no known reports to indicate that this Spectre variant 2 (CVE 2017-5715 ) has been used to attack customers. We recommend Windows customers, when appropriate, reenable the mitigation against CVE-2017-5715 when Intel reports that this unpredictable system behavior has been resolved for your device,” Microsoft said in its &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4078130/update-to-disable-mitigation-against-spectre-variant-2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;advisory.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Microsoft quickly released mitigations for Meltdown and Spectre after the attack methods were disclosed, but the company’s own updates were also buggy. Shortly after it had started rolling them out, Microsoft was forced to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.securityweek.com/microsoft-suspends-cpu-flaw-patches-amd-devices&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;suspend patches&lt;/a&gt; for devices with AMD processors due to instability issues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities allow malicious applications to bypass memory isolation mechanisms and access sensitive data. The Meltdown attack relies on one vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2017-5754, but there are two main variants of the Spectre attack, including CVE-2017-5753 (Variant 1) and CVE-2017-5715 (Variant 2).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meltdown and Variant 1 of Spectre can be patched efficiently with software updates, but Spectre Variant 2 requires microcode updates for a complete fix.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Intel, AMD and Apple face &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.securityweek.com/amd-apple-sued-over-cpu-vulnerabilities&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;class action lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; over the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities. However, Intel does not appear too concerned that the incident will affect its bottom line – the company &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.securityweek.com/intel-working-cpus-meltdown-spectre-protections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;expects&lt;/a&gt; 2018 to be a record year in terms of revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
